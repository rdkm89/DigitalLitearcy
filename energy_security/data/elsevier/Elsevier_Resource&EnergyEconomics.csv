"The development of cost-effective technologies, along with high crude oil and natural gas prices, accelerated shale oil and gas extraction in the United States in the early 2000s. We explore the schooling response to this boom, taking advantage of timing and spatial variation in well-drilling activities. We show that intensive drilling activities decreased grade 11 and 12 enrollment over the 14-year study period—41,760 fewer students enrolled per year across the 15 states considered in this analysis (95% C.I.: 12,685–71,567). We investigate heterogeneous effects and show that the effect was larger in states with a younger compulsory schooling age (16 years of age instead of 17 or 18), in states with a lower effective tax rate on oil and gas production, and in non-metro counties with traditional mining or persistent poverty.",Volume 55,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/55/suppl/C,1
"An experiment is proposed in which the subjects could contribute to a public good which could be thought of as reducing pollution, which was stochastic. A nudge (announcement of the socially optimal contribution) and a tax are implemented to improve the level of contributions. The environmental sensitivity and optimism of the subjects are also elicited. Our first result shows that the implementation of the nudge does not perform as well as the implementation of the tax. The reaction to the nudge depends directly on individuals’ environmental sensitivity, contrary to the reaction to the tax. Secondly, the nudge performs well with highly sensitive subjects only during the first half of its implementation. Lastly, the efficiency analysis shows that the implementation of the nudge significantly decreases the groups’ welfare for the least sensitive subjects, in comparison to the baseline.",Volume 55,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/55/suppl/C,1
"We examine the impact of constructing a new, large scale natural gas pipeline on environmental outcomes and fuel consumption patterns in China. We use the construction of three natural gas pipelines in China, constructed at different times but operated by the same state-owned enterprise, as a quasi-experiment to estimate the impact of pipeline projects as a driver of changes in air quality. We then estimate the impact of the pipeline on firm and household energy choices providing a mechanism to explain the reductions in air pollution we find. The difference-in-differences estimates indicate that placing the pipeline into operation significantly reduced emission intensity and led to an increase in natural gas intensity and decrease in coal intensity in industrial sectors with more limited impacts on residential energy consumption.",Volume 55,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/55/suppl/C,1
"This paper presents an analysis of environmental policy in imperfectly competitive market with publicly disclosed and privately-held information about costs. We examine the potential asymmetry-reducing role of disclosure and its impact on setting environmental taxes. From a policy perspective, our findings show that disclosure with verifiable reports, is a valuable public good, provides greater transparency in the market, and is generally efficiency enhancing. Results suggest that access to publicly disclosed information enables the fine-tuning of the tax rules towards specific environmental circumstances and improves the ability of the regulator to levy firm-specific environmental taxes. Further, while we do not attempt to analyze the exchange of information process between players, our findings show that, despite its advantages, exogenously disclosed information can be double-edged sword since it may also produce anticompetitive effects by facilitating collusive behavior. Information sharing between firms may occur and thus lead to a superior outcome in terms of industry output and emissions, which undermines environmental policy performance.",Volume 54,November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/54/suppl/C,2
"Understanding responses to government action is critical for developing efficient policy. In the context of land conservation, this paper examines whether municipal policy has a crowding-in or crowding-out effect on neighboring municipalities’ actions and state government actions. Importantly, we focus on municipal conservation referendums, which allow us to use a regression discontinuity framework for causal inference. Using data from Massachusetts and New Jersey, our findings suggest municipal conservation decisions have no effect on neighboring local governments’ or the state’s conservation activity.",Volume 54,November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/54/suppl/C,2
"The 21st century oil and gas boom is drastically changing life in the American West. While previous literature has examined how resource booms affect household income and infant health, the effects of resource booms on crime remain largely unstudied. We develop a simple model that demonstrates an oil and gas boom could increase or decrease crime as employment opportunities, inequality, and other aspects of the local economy change. Combining well data provided by drillinginfo.com and FBI incident-level crime data; we examine intra-county changes in both property and violent crime in Colorado as wells open and shut down. We find a positive relationship between the well density of a county and both violent and property crimes. This suggests that while counties in resource intense areas may receive a financial windfall from a rapidly expanding industry base, increased public safety spending may be needed to counteract increases in crime.",Volume 54,November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/54/suppl/C,2
"A typical activity of environmental policy agencies is to clean-up polluted sites. This study uses a simple model to analyze the optimal timing of the clean-ups, their size and the optimal order to clean the sites. A waiting rule is derived, which implies that it is generally not optimal to clean a site immediately but to delay the cleaning, and that information solely on the pollution damages and clean-up costs is not sufficient to decide the optimal clean-up order. The results are discussed in the context of exhaustible resource production, mining legacy, radioactive waste containment and brownfield development. For example, the results indicate that if it is optimal to delay the clean-up, the optimal deposit by the exhaustible resource producer to the rehabilitation fund will be inversely related to the initial pollution level of the site and will be less than the cost of rehabilitation.",Volume 54,November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/54/suppl/C,2
"This paper reports the results of a stated preference experiment designed to test how information about a good’s attributes provided in a survey affects knowledge, and how knowledge affects preferences for that good. A novel experimental design allows us to elicit subjects’ ex ante knowledge levels about a public good’s attributes, exogenously vary how much new objective information about these attributes we provide to subjects, elicit subjects’ valuation for the good, and elicit posterior knowledge states about the same attributes. We find evidence of incomplete learning and fatigue: as subjects are told more information, their marginal learning rates decrease. Consistent with previous work, ex ante knowledge does affect stated willingness to pay. However, we find no significant marginal impact of knowledge on the mean nor the variance of willingness to pay for changes in the environmental good conditional on ex ante knowledge. Our results are consistent with a number of conceptual models of information processing and preferences, including confirmation bias, costly search, and timing differences in learning and preference formation.",Volume 54,November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/54/suppl/C,2
"Comparative feedbacks, that is personalized messages describing how one's behavior compares to that of relevant others, are currently widely used in order to change people's behaviors. Such feedbacks may induce recipients to update their beliefs about both reachable material outcomes and perceived self/social esteem. Both channels are very hard to disentangle in the field, which notably makes welfare analysis a very challenging task. This paper uses an online experiment that makes it possible to focus, within the considered setting, on the role of pure information on material outcomes. Despite an absence of normative pressure, comparative feedbacks are found to trigger comparable or even greater changes in behaviors than other kinds of informative and more accurate feedbacks. A possible explanation may be that comparative feedbacks more effectively conveyed to participants the idea that it should not be too difficult for them to reach a better outcome.",Volume 54,November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/54/suppl/C,2
"This study examines the association between social preferences and recycling behavior in a developing country. A conceptual framework that modifies the impure altruism model with heterogeneous preferences and further incorporates the impure public good model is presented to study informal recycling behaviors. Based on survey data collected from 755 households in Hanoi, Vietnam, we find that the majority of sample households recycle all the recyclable materials they consume even though such recycling is not obligatory. Half the recycling households sell their recyclables to informal junk buyers, whereas the other half provide recyclables without monetary compensation. Our finding of voluntary recycling implies that a certain proportion of households have a positive marginal willingness to pay for an increase in the environmental public good. The results of the regression analyses show that recycling behavior is associated with altruism, as measured by a modified version of the self-report altruism scale. Among high-income households, recycling behavior is associated with inequality aversion, as elicited from a hypothetical game. These findings suggest that social preferences are important determinants of the private provision of public goods through the informal sector in a developing country.",Volume 54,November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/54/suppl/C,2
"Arctic oil extraction is inconsistent with the 2 °C target. We study unilateral strategies by climate-concerned Arctic countries to deter extraction by others. Contradicting common theoretical assumptions about climate-change mitigation, our setting is one where countries may fundamentally disagree about whether mitigation by others is beneficial. This is because Arctic oil extraction requires specific R&D, hence entry by one country expands the extraction-technology market, decreasing costs for others. This means that, on the one hand, countries that extract Arctic oil gain if others do so as well. On the other hand, as countries may disagree about how harmful climate change is, they may disagree whether an equilibrium where all enter is better or worse than an equilibrium where all stay out. Less environmentally-concerned countries (preferring maximum entry) have a first-mover advantage but, because they rely on entry by others, entry in equilibrium is determined by the preferences of those who are moderately concerned about the environment. Furthermore, using a pooling strategy, an environmentally-concerned country can deter entry by credibly “pretending” to be environmentally adamant, and thus be expected to not follow. A rough calibration suggests a country like Norway, or prospects of a green future U.S. administration, could be pivotal in determining whether the Arctic will be explored.",Volume 54,November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/54/suppl/C,2
"When costs are presented as a series of recurring payments in stated preference choice experiment (CE) questions, how respondents discount future payments is important in explaining choices and in the measurement of the present value of willingness to pay. In this paper, alternative discounting approaches are compared to examine their effect on measuring preferences and values using data from a survey examining public preferences for the protection of an endangered species. Exponential and hyperbolic discounting assumptions lead to very similar results in terms of both model fit and welfare. All estimated models suggest future payments are discounted at a very high rate. Several factors likely influencing the magnitude of these estimated discount rates are discussed, and then an argument is made for using payment vehicles in stated preference studies that employ a single lump sum payment rather than a series of future payments.",Volume 54,November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/54/suppl/C,2
"The effectiveness of climate policy strongly depends on how these measures are implemented. National policy measures may have international spillover effects which partly neutralize domestic emission reduction, while different types of policy measures may offset each other as well. This paper explores the conditions for these interaction effects by using a concise partial-equilibrium two-country model of the electricity market which also includes a system for emissions trading. We find that the international spillover effects not only depend on the integration of electricity markets, but also on the tightness of the emissions-trading system. We show that this tightness is negatively related to the degree the supply of renewable energy is stimulated. We find that the more renewable energy is stimulated, the less domestic reduction in carbon emissions is offset by spillover effects. A more binding cap in the emissions-trading system makes national policies less effective. Hence, if climate-policy measures such as subsidies for renewable energy make the cap in the trading scheme less binding, these climate-policy measures become more effective.",Volume 54,November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/54/suppl/C,2
"This paper develops a detailed partial equilibrium model of the global helium market to study the effects of the recently decided rapid phase out of the U.S. Federal Helium Reserve (FHR), a vast strategic stockpile accumulated during the 1960s. The model incorporates a detailed representation of that industry and treats both helium producers and the FHR as players in a dynamic non-cooperative game. The goal of each player is assumed to be the maximization of discounted profit, subject to technical and resource constraints. We consider two alternative policies aimed at organizing the phase out of the FHR: the currently implemented one and a less stringent one whereby the FHR would be allowed to operate as a profit-maximizing agent during an extended period of time. Evidences gained from a series of market simulations indicate that, compared to the current policy, a less stringent policy mandate systematically increases the financial return to the U.S. federal budget, always enhances environmental outcomes as it lowers helium venting into the atmosphere, and also augments global welfare in three out of the four scenarios considered in the paper.",Volume 54,November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/54/suppl/C,2
"This study shows that the level of trust matters for how corruption affects public policy outcomes in the long-run, in particular the stringency of environmental policies. We argue that the level of trust affects the relative strength of industry- and environmental lobby groups, and therefore the effect of corruption on the stringency of environmental policies. We use a novel index of the level of corruption in each state which uses Associated Press (AP) news wires. We find that higher corruption reduces the stringency of environmental policies when the level of trust is low, but the effect declines and even becomes positive at higher levels of trust.",Volume 54,November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/54/suppl/C,2
"This article uses hourly data on household usage of an in-home display (IHD) in a randomized field experiment to investigate how acquiring information from IHDs affects electricity usage of households. Providing IHDs, which enables households to see a graph of their half-hourly electricity consumption in real time, is a promising policy intervention that corrects for biases associated with inattention and limited information-processing capacity by promoting salience and learning. The immediate effect of providing an IHD is heightened household attention to information on consumption, and the repetition of attention is expected to improve households’ capacity to process information.The estimation results of a simultaneous equation model with discrete choice of hourly IHD usage and continuous hourly consumption of electricity of 501 households living in a southern area of Kyoto, Japan, over 36 days in summer 2012 provide evidence on the effects of real-time information feedback over time. The cumulative usage of IHDs reduced hourly electricity consumption of “energy-using” households whose electricity consumption before the experiment had been far higher than other households. Contrary to the energy-conservation literature, the cumulative usage of IHDs raised electricity consumption of “energy-saving” households whose electricity consumption had been relatively modest before the experiment. This may be due to a “boomerang effect,” which raised electricity usage of well-informed households whose electricity saving had exceeded the optimal saving before obtaining information about their actual usage.",Volume 53,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/53/suppl/C,3
"We consider an overlapping generations (OLG) economy with land as a fixed factor of production and an environmental externality on production in which tax revenue from land rent and/or from other schemes such as labor income, capital income, and production taxation can be used for environmental protection through investment in emission mitigation. We show that, for any given target of stationary stock of pollution, the land rent taxation scheme leads to a higher steady state capital accumulation than the other schemes, and hence the steady state consumption of agents when young under this scheme is also higher than under the others. In addition, under an ambitious mitigation target when the efficiency of the mitigation technology is relatively high compared to the dirtiness of production, the land rent taxation also provides a higher steady state consumption when old, resulting in higher social welfare, than the others. In the second part of the paper, we propose a period-by-periodbalanced budget policy, which includes land rent and capital income taxes with intergenerational transfers, to decentralize the socially optimal allocation during the transitional phase to the social planner's steady state.",Volume 53,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/53/suppl/C,3
"Water shortages worldwide are increasingly managed via supply diversification. Yet efforts to optimise diversification have thus far failed to account for important empirical evidence on habit-driven water demand. To resolve this disconnect, an intertemporal optimisation model is developed to generate a supply portfolio that weights alternative sources of water according to the uncertainty of inflows, supply costs and habit formation. The model demonstrates that failure to account for habit-driven consumption leads to sup-optimal water infrastructure investments with too much emphasis on risky, weather-dependent sources, while weather-independent sources with guaranteed supply are underemphasised. Importantly, the optimal share of safe sources depends critically on how sensitive habit formation is to supply shocks. This implies that the benefits of policies targeting water saving behaviours and investments during periods of low supply extend beyond water conservation to more cost-effective supply portfolios. Empirical results demonstrate the importance of accommodating habit-driven demand within optimal diversification strategies.",Volume 53,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/53/suppl/C,3
"This paper studies the effect of a minimum quality standard, a compulsory labeling scheme, and the combination of both instruments in a vertical differentiation model when not all quality dimensions can be observed by consumers. Both a minimum quality standard for the non-observable quality dimension and a labeling scheme that informs consumers about the non-observable quality dimension increase prices and have no effect on the observable quality dimension or market shares. The combination of a minimum quality standard and a labeling scheme increases both the unobservable and the observable quality dimension, increases prices, and shifts market shares from the high quality firm to the low quality firm. Social welfare is higher under the combination of both instruments than under no regulation, the minimum quality standard or labeling applied as only instrument.",Volume 53,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/53/suppl/C,3
"A salient feature of the Clean Power Plan is that it imposes higher emission rate standards on coal power plants than it does on their natural gas counterparts. In this paper, I examine the consequences of this design feature by modeling a series of tradable performance standard policies. I analyze how fuel-based standard differentiation affects compliance incentives and the regulatory burden on coal stakeholders through three key outcomes: coal usage, coal plant profits, and electricity prices. Analysis of a simple analytic model shows that differentiation, compared to a policy with a uniform standard for all fuel types, always increases coal usage, but price and profit impacts are ambiguous. To quantify these outcomes, I construct and implement a detailed simulation model of the U.S. wholesale electricity market. Simulation results suggest that differentiation increases coal usage modestly, increases coal plant profits well beyond the no-regulation level, and increases electricity prices in almost every region of the country.",Volume 53,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/53/suppl/C,3
"Large firms are becoming increasingly dominant in the natural gas production industry. At the same time, regulators and environmental groups are concerned about potential environmental damage associated with hydraulic fracturing. However, small firms are protected from the full extent of their damages, while large firms must internalize a greater portion of their social costs. This paper examines the effect of firm size and liability on environmental safety in the context of hydraulic fracturing in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale across three dimensions of size. Impacts of firm size on safety are found across legal, regulatory, and brand dimensions of size with the largest effects being driven by changes in regulatory liability. These safety gains are sizable as violation rates would be approximately twice as high if firms at remained at 2008 sizes.",Volume 53,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/53/suppl/C,3
"We provide a framework that links the impacts of own and neighboring measures of institutional quality as well as neighboring country environmental regulations on environmental regulation stringency in own country. We estimate a Spatial Panel Durbin model to identify significant determinants of environmental regulations for several European countries. We find no evidence of strategic interaction as the environmental regulations implemented by a neighbor have no significant impact on environmental regulations implemented in the own country. The higher the quality of government institutions in a country, the more stringent the implementation of environmental regulations. Additionally, some institutional quality variables significantly positively impact the stringency of environmental regulations in neighboring countries.",Volume 53,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/53/suppl/C,3
"In this paper, we analyze a duopoly market with investment in abatement technology under environmental regulation. We use a three-stage game where firms invest in a green technology with spillover effects in the first stage, the regulator sets the emission fee in the second stage, and production of the polluting good occurs in the third stage. We analyze two different regulatory regimes: (1) each firm faces the same emission fee (uniform fee), and (2) each firm faces an emission fee dependent on the investment in green technology (type-dependent fee). Firms can differ through their costs of investing in the abatement technology (asymmetric efficiency). We obtain that social welfare is unambiguously higher under the type-dependent regime than otherwise. In addition, we find that the asymmetry in efficiency of investment affects firms’ profits, identifying that efficient (inefficient) firms favor type-dependent (uniform) policy regimes.",Volume 53,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/53/suppl/C,3
"Reallocating water according to its highest marginal value can generate economic gains. However, reallocation of water use often generates third-party effects, or externalities, which prohibit transfers. We develop a spatial-dynamic hydro-economic model to assess the gains from redistributing water across irrigators, taking into account externalities that water use transfers may produce. Water use is optimized across space and time such that return flows in various segments of the watershed do not decrease relative to the flows obtained under current water use. Across a suite of water shortage scenarios in Idaho’s Eastern Snake River Plain, the reallocation of water subject to third party externalities generates an 8–16% increase in aggregate annual profit earned by irrigators, relative to the Prior Appropriation-based allocation. The failure to account for the constraints on reallocation that arise due to externalities overstates the benefits from reallocation by 7%.",Volume 53,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/53/suppl/C,3
"Frequently, housing is the largest item on a household's balance sheet, and therefore making monthly mortgage payments is often both the largest regular expenditure as well as a primary savings vehicle for households. However, changes to economic conditions impact household spending and savings decisions. To investigate the dynamics of this relationship, we examine mortgage payment choices of homeowners who purchased property in areas that later experienced a positive shock to local economic conditions via the shale oil and gas boom. We find that borrowers with properties located in areas with shale oil and gas booms experienced a 6% reduction in the probability of missing a mortgage payment over the period 2007–2014. Indexing these results to the size of the boom, we find that one hundred additional rigs (billion dollars of oil and gas produced) are associated with a 3.2% (1.6%) decrease in default. Additionally, we find differential effects on housing markets across geography, time, loan leverage, and credit risk categories.",Volume 53,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/53/suppl/C,3
"Several previous studies have evaluated the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits of forest biomass energy relative to fossil fuel equivalents over different spatial scales and time frames and applying a variety of methodologies. This paper contributes to this literature through an analysis of multiple projected sources of biomass demand growth in different regions of the world using a detailed intertemporal optimization model of the global forest sector. Given the range of current policies incentivizing bioenergy expansion globally, evaluating the combined global implications of regional bioenergy expansion efforts is critical for understanding the extent to which renewable energy supplied from forest biomass can contribute to various policy goals (including GHG emissions mitigation). Unlike previous studies that have been more regionally focused, this study provides a global perspective, illustrating how large potential demand increases for forest biomass in one or multiple regions can alter future forest management trends, markets, and forest carbon sequestration in key timber supply regions. Results show that potential near term (2015–2030) biomass demand growth in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere can drive forest resource investment at the intensive and extensive margins, resulting in a net increase in forest carbon stocks for most regions of the world. When the reallocation of biomass away from traditional pulp and sawtimber markets is accounted for, net forest carbon sequestration increases (that stored on the land and in wood products) by 9.4 billion tons CO2 over the near term and 15.4 billion tons CO2 by 2095. Even if most of the increased forest biomass demand arises from one region (e.g., Europe) due to a particularly strong promotion of forest bioenergy expansion, changes in forest management globally in anticipation of this demand increase could result in carbon beneficial outcomes that can be shared by most regions.",Volume 53,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/53/suppl/C,3
"We analyze rig rate formation of floaters operating on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. We first develop a simple bargaining model for rig markets. Then we examine empirically the most important drivers for rig rate formation in the period 1991q4 to 2016q1. We consider reduced form time series models and report conditional point and interval forecasts for rig rates in a reference case based on constant real oil price and with some increase in the capacity utilization. According to our results, rig rates increase very modestly in this reference case. We also consider alternative simulations, e.g., featuring a higher real crude oil price (in 2010 USD) gradually increasing to 100 USD per barrel in 2022q4. In this case, the rig rates become about 41 percent higher in 2022q4 than in the reference case. If in addition capacity utilization increases more rapidly, and to a higher level than in the reference simulation, the rig rate is 48 percent higher. In the last alternative simulation, we explore the effects of opening new Arctic areas for petroleum activity, in which case forecasted rig rates in 2022q4 are 26 percent higher than in the reference simulation.",Volume 53,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/53/suppl/C,3
"This paper explores how the dynamic management of a non-renewable resource is affected by an endogenous (i.e., mitigable) risk of expropriation. The time at risk increases with the value of the resource in the ground and decreases with the cost of expropriating the resource. When the risk of expropriation is internalized by the legitimate owner, in the absence of capacity constraints, the resource is depleted faster than it is socially optimal. Interestingly, a marginal improvement in the protection of property rights exacerbates the over-extraction of the resource. In the presence of endogenous capacity constraints, and when property rights are imperfectly protected, both under- and over-extraction are possible. If property rights are relatively strong the resource owner under-invests in extraction capacity and depletes the resource below the socially optimal rate. If property rights are relatively weak the owner over-invests and the resource is over-extracted.",Volume 52,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/52/suppl/C,4
"Outdoor streetlights are among the highest recurring energy-related expenses faced by municipalities. As a cost-savings measure, many cities have recently made large investments in energy efficient light emitting diode (LED) streetlights. Most LED streetlights produce a different wavelength of light that is often brighter than that produced by existing lights, which has led to high-profile debates on their impacts to the environment, human health, crime, and transportation safety. However, there is a lack of credible empirical evidence on the direction and magnitude of LED streetlight externalities, including their impacts to subjective well-being. To address this knowledge gap, we investigate local externalities of investments in LED streetlights across the 100 largest US counties by population using subjective well-being data from the US CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System over 2005–2010. Difference-in-differences results suggest that LED retrofits generate significant positive well-being impacts, varying by respondent demographic characteristics and the number of streetlights replaced. On average, installing LED streetlights generates an externality equivalent to a $477 (6.9%) increase in per capita monthly household income.",Volume 52,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/52/suppl/C,4
"Based on the empirical evidence that improved environmental quality makes workers more productive, this paper develops a model that pollution abatement can raise firm profitability by enhancing worker productivity. We investigate two types of environmental regulations – government intervention and voluntary regulation, showing that both can induce the collective action of imperfectly competitive firms to abate pollution, which increases their profits as well as social welfare. A pollution tax can prompt a firm to raise output if the productivity gain arising from total pollution reduction offsets the firm's pollution cost. We characterize the optimal pollution tax and demonstrate that the combination of a pollution tax and an output subsidy can lead to the social optimum. Voluntary regulation tends to fully internalize the productivity effect of reduced pollution for firms, although it facilitates firms’ collusion in restricting production. Moreover, we conduct a simulation evaluating the welfare consequences of the two regulations in comparison with the social optimum.",Volume 52,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/52/suppl/C,4

"In order to better understand the potential for both policy and technological improvements to aid carbon abatement, long-term historical information on the time-path of transition from more traditional to cleaner fuels is useful. This is a relatively understudied element of the fuel switching literature in both developed and emerging economies. This research adds to this literature by examining the adoption time-path of network gas as a heating fuel. We merge a unique dataset on gas network roll-out over time, with other geo-coded data and employ an instrumental variables technique in order to simultaneously model supply and demand. Results indicate a non-linear relationship between the proportion of households using gas as their primary means of central heating and the length of time the network has been in place in each area. Proximity to the gas network, peat bogs, and areas which have banned the consumption of bituminous coal also affect gas connections. Variations in socioeconomic and dwelling characteristics at area level can also help explain connections to the gas network. A better understanding of this variation is crucial in designing targeted policies and can aid network expansion decisions.",Volume 52,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/52/suppl/C,4
"Biogas production may make an important contribution to multiple policy objectives, i.e. the transition to renewable energy, increased recycling of agricultural waste and reduction in greenhouse gas emission from agriculture. Despite the role of biogas in achieving these wider benefits, the engagement of stakeholders such as farmers has been low and the barriers to their participation in biogas production is not well understood. This study examines farmers’ willingness to participate in a unique, manure-based collective biogas investment based on a discrete choice experiment study of Danish farmers. Our results show that the majority of farmers, including farmers who never considered investing in biogas before and farmers that already participate in conventional biogas plants, are interested in a partnership-based biogas investment (PBI). A mixed logit model with flexible distribution shows that farmers’ participation in PBI is mainly motivated by a moderate number of partner farmers, short distance between the farm and the plant, contract options to sell biogas, an option to cancel the partnership, and free startup consultancy. Farmers are willing to accept a significant reduction in subsidy to acquire favorable aspects of the PBI. A second stage analysis of farmers’ intensity of participation also reveals that an increase in livestock units, involvement in off-farm activity, increase in farm size, and positive view towards investment enhance willingness to supply manure. Linking results from discrete choice and corner solution models, we estimate the average manure supply to a partnership-based biogas plant to be around 96,000 tons/year.",Volume 52,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/52/suppl/C,4

We consider a carbon pricing policy in Alberta's electricity market as a case study. This policy consists of two phases. In the first phase, the carbon price is increased with the output subsidy being based on a fraction of facility-level emission intensity. In the second phase, the output subsidy is altered to be uniform across assets and based on the emissions intensity of an efficient natural gas asset. Using a model of oligopoly competition, we simulate the short-run impacts of the two phases on electricity prices, emissions, and unit and firm-level profitability. We find that the mechanisms by which electricity prices and emissions change in response to carbon pricing differ depending on whether the market is perfectly competitive or oligopolistic. We demonstrate that by differentiating the effective carbon price across technologies, changing the basis of the output subsidy has substantially larger price and emissions effects than increasing the carbon price for all generators. The estimated effects of carbon pricing vary as the firms’ generation portfolios change.",Volume 52,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/52/suppl/C,4
"Interest in expanding market-based approaches involving intra-pollutant trading (trading “like” pollutants) to allow inter-pollutant trading (trading “dis-similar” pollutants) is growing. Because many pollutants are regulated separately, designing inter-pollutant markets requires considering pre-existing regulatory constraints. We examine the optimal choices of inter- and intra-pollutant trade ratios when (i) some firms generate multiple pollutants affecting different media and (ii) permit caps are sub-optimal, having been exogenously specified by prior regulations. While the first-best outcome is unobtainable in this setting, we find inter-pollutant trading enhances efficiency by offering an additional policy instrument: the inter-pollutant trade ratio. Moreover, adjustments to intra-pollutant trade ratios reflecting the joint production of dis-similar pollutants can enhance efficiency. We also find realistic cases where inter-pollutant trading may universally improve environmental quality, easing concerns that trading across environmental media may harm one medium. An example of nitrogen trading in Pennsylvania’s Susquehanna River Basin illustrates our results.",Volume 52,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/52/suppl/C,4
"Households make an investment analysis when buying new electrical appliances. Therefore, expectations about future electricity consumption may have an impact on current consumption and investment decisions. Dynamic partial adjustment models of residential electricity demand neglect rational consumer behaviour. In this paper we propose a model for residential electricity demand that allows for forward-looking behaviour. We estimate lead consumption models using two stages least squares fixed effects on a panel of 48 US states between 1995 and 2011. We find that expectations about future consumption have an impact on current consumption decisions. This novel approach may improve our understanding of the dynamics of residential electricity demand and the evaluation of the effects of energy policies.",Volume 52,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/52/suppl/C,4
"Switching from coal-fired to natural gas-fired generation and increasing the thermal efficiency (energy generated per unit of energy burned) of fossil fuel fired electricity generation plants have been identified as ways of achieving meaningful emission reductions. In this study, we examine the fuel-price responsiveness across gas plant technologies and across the market structures in which the plants operate. We find that there are significant differences in the generation and efficiency responses of gas plants to fuel prices across generation technologies and market structures. Specifically, our results indicate that, regardless of market structure, generation from natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants is responsive to both coal and gas prices, but that generation from simple cycle (NGSC) plants only respond to gas prices. On the other hand, with respect to efficiency, we generally find that only NGCC plants operating in deregulated regions show statistically significant efficiency improvements in response to coal price increases and that, generally, neither NGCC or NGSC plants, regardless of market structure, respond in any significant way to gas prices. Finally, using these parameter estimates, we calculate emissions savings from efficiency improvements and fuel-switching possibilities.",Volume 52,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/52/suppl/C,4
"Continued high reliance on traditional biomass fuels and stoves in developing countries gives rise to several human health, environmental, and livelihood issues. However solid data on the performance of improved biomass cooking stoves remains scarce. This paper provides controlled cooking test (CCT) evidence on fuel savings from a promising improved biomass cooking stove in Ethiopia. The stove is called Mirt (meaning “best” in Amharic), and is used to bake injera, the staple food in much of Ethiopia. Injera preparation accounts for about half the primary energy consumed in the country. We find that the Mirt stove offers fuel savings of 22% to 31% compared with a traditional three-stone tripod, with little or no increase in cooking time. Fuel savings in the CCTs are significant, but are substantially smaller than in laboratory testing. Users also generally report high levels of satisfaction with the stove, which is crucial for successful large-scale adoption. The fuelwood savings increase and cooking times decline over time, suggesting the importance of user experience and learning. Though our results are robust to different ways that the stoves were rolled out, conclusions regarding acceptability of the stove are still indicative, because of the CCT methodology we employ. Despite the limitations of our study, the findings suggest that the Mirt stove could have positive welfare effects for households who adopt it.",Volume 52,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/52/suppl/C,4
"This paper presents a simple dynamic general equilibrium model with supply-side strategic interactions to study the economic effects of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in an economy with an emission cap and oligopolistic firms competing on prices. With such endogenous market structure a gradual decarbonization policy is likely to induce higher markups, while the number of active firms displays a U-shaped behavior, first decreasing and then increasing. In the long run more firms are active, but they transfer a part of the compliance cost to households by charging a higher markup. The negative effects on the level of economic activity of this anti-competitive outcome are strongly mitigated by recycling policies.",Volume 52,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/52/suppl/C,4
"To address the issue of potential information asymmetries inherent in the estimation of deforestation baselines required by the current Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation+ (REDD+) scheme, we offer a theoretical analysis of an extended scheme relying on the theory of incentives. We compare two types of contracts: a deforestation-based contract and a policy-based contract. Each of them implies a dramatically different information rent/efficiency trade-off due to domestic implementation and transaction costs. If the contract is deforestation-based (resp. policy-based), information rents are awarded to countries with the ex ante lowest (resp. highest) intended deforestation. We show that a general contract can be offered to recipient countries in which the type of instrument proposed is endogenous, independent of the historical trend, unlike the current REDD+ mechanism. Dividing countries into two groups corresponding to the deforestation-based instrument and the policy-based instrument helps the donor country to obtain efficient deforestation and avoided deforestation levels.",Volume 51,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/51/suppl/C,5

"This paper provides the first empirical evidence of the distributional effects of subsidies for the purchase of alternative vehicles based on an extended version of Hausman's exact consumer surplus. In consistence with economic theory, we estimate changes in household welfare, inequality, and social welfare resulting from different reforms. First, we find that an additional tax on conventional fuel is regressive. However, returning the additional tax revenue via lump-sum transfers can alleviate this effect. Second, when the additional revenue is also used to finance subsidies for electrical and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, households that own such vehicles experience welfare gains. However, this policy also increases income inequality and decreases social welfare.",Volume 51,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/51/suppl/C,5
"Trade negotiations have started to pay attention to liberalization in environmental goods (EGs), whose production may require dirty intermediate goods. We construct a two-country trade model to explore the effects of trade liberalization in EGs on the local pollution, the global environment and welfare in the presence of such an environmental conundrum. We find that countries do not necessarily benefit from trade liberalization in EGs in the absence of an environmental policy. With the assistance of an upstream pollution tax, trade liberalization in EGs improves each country's welfare. This result holds independent of whether the upstream market is competitive or not, or whether we have upstream trade across countries. For asymmetric countries, trade liberalization in EGs improves the world welfare and the welfare for the country if it has a smaller demand for EGs; or experiences less damage from the production of dirty inputs; or values environment improvement more.",Volume 51,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/51/suppl/C,5
"We develop a dynamic model of groundwater extraction for irrigation where climate change and technical change are included as exogenous state variables in addition to the usual state variable of the stock of groundwater. Our key contributions are (i) an intuitive description of the conditions under which groundwater extraction can be non-monotonic, (ii) a numerical demonstration that extraction is non-monotonic in an important region overlying the Ogallala Aquifer, and (iii) the predicted gains from management are substantially larger after accounting for climate and technical change. Intuitively, optimal extraction is increasing in early periods when the marginal benefits of extraction are increasing sufficiently fast due to climate and technical change compared to the increase in the marginal cost of extraction. In contrast, most previous studies include the stock of groundwater as the only state variable and recommend a monotonically decreasing extraction path. We conduct numerical simulations for a region in Kansas overlying the Ogallala Aquifer and find that optimal groundwater extraction peaks 23 years in the future and the gains from management are large (29.5%). Consistent with previous literature, the predicted gains from management are relatively small (6.1%) when ignoring climate and technical change. The realized gains from management are not substantially impacted by incorrect assumptions of climate and technical change when formulating the optimal plan.",Volume 51,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/51/suppl/C,5
"In many regions, renewable energy targets are a primary decarbonization policy. Most of the same jurisdictions also subsidize the manufacturing and/or deployment of renewable energy technologies, some being sufficiently aggressive as to engender WTO disputes. We consider a downstream energy-using product produced competitively but not traded across regions, such as electricity or transportation. A renewable energy technology is available, provided by a limited set of upstream suppliers who exercise market power. With multiple market failures (emissions externality and imperfect competition), renewable market share mandates as the binding climate policy, and international trade in equipment, the stage is set to examine rationales for green industrial policy. Subsidies may be provided downstream to energy suppliers and/or upstream to technology suppliers; each has tradeoffs. Subsidies can offset underprovision of the renewable alternative by the upstream suppliers, but they allow dirty generation to expand as the portfolio standard becomes less costly to fulfill. Downstream subsidies raise all upstream profits and crowd out foreign emissions. Upstream subsidies increase domestic upstream market share but expand emissions globally. In our two-region model, strategic subsidies chosen noncooperatively can be optimal from a global perspective, if both regions value emissions at the global cost of carbon. But if the regions sufficiently undervalue global emissions, restricting the use of upstream subsidies can enhance welfare.",Volume 51,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/51/suppl/C,5
"This paper explores the impact of information on the hedonic valuation of proximity to contaminated sites. The analysis exploits the passage of a 2004 New Jersey property disclosure law to identify an external change in information. The law required real estate sellers to disclose information about nearby contaminated sites. After presenting a model of the impact of disamenity information on home prices, we use several econometric variations to test hypotheses about the effects of additional information. Results indicate that the impact on home prices near contaminated sites depended on the baseline information about contamination. Homes prices near widely-known contaminated sites did not see a change after the disclosure law. However, homes near sites that were less well-known before the disclosure did see a drop in price as home buyers were given new information. Our results have several important implications on the assumptions of the hedonic model and could be used to formulate more effective disclosure laws in the future.",Volume 50,November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/50/suppl/C,6

"This paper analyzes the effect of passive investment in rival firms on the setting of uniform taxes and uniform absolute emission standards by the government. When firms are equal and there is no cross-ownership, standards and taxes are equivalent and generate the same social welfare. However, under cross-ownership that result does not hold since cross-ownership reduces market competition, which has a different effect on taxes and standards. In general, we find that when cross-ownership is low social welfare is greater with a tax, and when it is high social welfare is greater with a standard.",Volume 50,November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/50/suppl/C,6
"Climate benefits of unilateral carbon policies are undermined by carbon leakage. To counteract leakage and increase global cost-effectiveness carbon tariffs can be imposed on the emissions embodied in imports from non-regulating regions. We present a stylized model analysis on the economic incentives for emissions abatement of producers subjected to carbon tariffs. The impacts of different carbon tariff designs are, then, quantified by an empirically based multi-sector, multi-region computable general equilibrium model of the global economy. We find that firm-targeted tariffs can deliver considerably stronger leakage reduction and higher gains in global cost-effectiveness than tariff designs operated at the industry level. Moreover, because the exporters are able to reduce their carbon tariffs by adjusting emissions, their competitiveness and the overall welfare of their economies will be less adversely affected than in the case of industry-level carbon tariff regimes.",Volume 50,November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/50/suppl/C,6
"Using confidential household-level data, we estimate spatial and demographic heterogeneity in household-level gasoline price elasticities and gasoline tax burdens from a 60-cent federal gasoline tax increase. In order to address unobserved consumer heterogeneity, we employ a parametric adaptation of the maximum score methodology to model the household’s choice of vehicles and driving decisions, allowing for disaggregated vehicle choices, vehicle-specific fixed effects, and interactions among the multiple vehicles in each household. We estimate average price elasticities of demand for gasoline at -0.74, with significant heterogeneity across space and demographics. We also find that rural and poor households bear the greater share of the burden from increasing taxes. Finally, we suggest a revenue recycling policy that helps mitigate the gasoline tax's resulting economic inequalities across household location and income. In addition, though a gasoline tax is an effective policy for reducing the externalities associated with driving, our policy also allows the government to retain some revenue from the tax even after the revenue recycling.",Volume 50,November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/50/suppl/C,6

We apply a standard trust game in the field with three treatments that allow us to relate our experimental results to actual soil conservation investments. We show that observed levels of trust, a measure of the encompassing concept of social capital, are positively related to such investments at the individual level. Trust itself is sensitive to the relative location of trustor and trustee in the game. Trust is not, however, sensitive to an enforcement intervention designed to raise investments in the trust game.

This system is then estimated using a panel of 679 eco-firms in 78 industrial Chinese cities during the implementation period of collection and use of pollution discharge fees (promulgated by the Chinese State Council) from 2003 to 2007.

"The ability of forests to store carbon is vital in maintaining the preset climate conditions, but is not systematically included in forest management or land-use decisions. Economic reasoning suggests subsidizing carbon storage, but empirical models show that this may easily more than double stand-level bare land values. Subsidization may thus be expensive, as it requires paying for all storage, including what would otherwise be obtained for free. To limit the consumption of public funds, the regulator may apply an additionality principle and solely subsidize storage exceeding a baseline level. We show that the commonly applied stand-level analysis suggests that the additionality principle could be applied to optimal rotation decisions without distortions. However, applying a forest vintage model with endogenous prices and land allocation decisions shows that similar application of the additionality principle causes distortions to both land allocation and optimal forest rotation. Nevertheless, subsidizing carbon storage by forest site productivity tax may still be preferable among the second-best policies. The distortions can be avoided by eliminating excessive subsidies by general land taxation irrespective of whether the land is used for forestry or agriculture.",Volume 50,November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/50/suppl/C,6
"This paper focuses on reforms that offset government revenue loss from a decrease in capital income taxation with an increase in a tax on dirty goods or a tax on pollution emissions. We build an overlapping generations model with age-dependent mortality rates. We numerically assess environmental and non-environmental welfare effects that existing and future generations experience over a lifetime. First, when the reform involves the dirty goods tax, we find that individuals older than 65 years old and future generations do not experience a double dividend. When the reform involves the pollution emissions tax, we find individuals older than 25 years old and future generations do not experience a double dividend. Second, contrary to the reform relying on the dirty goods tax, the reform relying on the pollution emissions tax has larger negative non-environmental welfare effects and larger positive environmental welfare effects for future generations. Third, we compare our results to those of the perpetual youth model. We show that the two models yield a different qualitative and quantitative assessment of the double dividend. Furthermore, the perpetual youth model tends to overstate the potential of the reforms for Pareto improvements and understate their adverse effects on net intergenerational distribution. Thus, our analysis suggests that those tax reforms alone cannot help achieve sustainable development as they redistribute welfare unequally across generations. Modeling a realistic demographic process is key in assessing intergenerational welfare distribution.",Volume 50,November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/50/suppl/C,6
"Regulator uncertainty is decisive for whether price or quantity regulation maximizes welfare in fisheries. In this paper, we develop a model of fisheries regulation that includes ecological uncertainly, variable economic uncertainty as well as structural economic uncertainty. We aggregate the effects of these uncertainties into a single welfare measure for comparing tax and quota regulation. It is shown that quotas are always preferred to fees when structural economic uncertainty dominates. Since most regulators are subject to this kind of uncertainty, this result is a potentially important qualification of the pro-price regulation message dominating the fisheries economics literature. We also believe that the model of a fishery developed in this paper could be applied to the regulation of other renewable resources where regulators are subject to uncertainty either directly or with some modification.",Volume 50,November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/50/suppl/C,6

"There are many instances where property rights are imperfectly defined, incomplete, or imperfectly enforced. The purpose of this normative paper is to address the following question: are there conditions under which partial property rights are economically efficient in a renewable resource economy? To address this question, we treat the level of completeness of property rights as a continuous variable in a renewable resource economy. By design, property rights restrict access to the resource, so they may allow a limited number of firms to exercise market power. We show that there exists a level of property rights completeness that leads to first-best resource exploitation; this level is different from either absent or complete property rights. Complete rights are neither necessary nor sufficient for efficiency in the presence of market power. We derive an analytic expression for the optimal level of property rights completeness and discuss its policy relevance and information requirements. The optimal level depends on (i) the number of firms, (ii) the elasticity of input productivity, and (iii) the price elasticity of market demand. We also find that a greater difference between the respective values of input and output requires stronger property rights. In fact, high profits imply both a severe potential commons problem and may be the expression of market power; strong property rights limit the commons problem; and their incompleteness offsets market power. Biology also impacts the optimal quality of property rights: when the stock of a resource is more sensitive to harvesting efforts, optimal property rights need to be more complete.",Volume 49,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/49/suppl/C,7
"This paper investigates interaction effects between permit and offset schemes, using the framework on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) as a test bed for evaluating the cost and benefit of including low-cost offsets in mandatory emission trading schemes. We use a real options model of firm-level investment decisions under stochastic prices to compare alternative emission trading and permit-offset linkage schemes. By isolating the critical design factors that drive energy investments, we seek to identify policy regimes that balance the different concerns in the polarized debate for and against the inclusion of offsets. Our findings indicate that a moderate offset quota is sufficient to contain investment crowding-out effects, while it still has a positive effect on profit distributions. In contrast, the classical permit price collar will not effectively change investment behavior, precisely because in a framework with multiple compliance instruments the volatility of cheaper offsets is the driving force for investment. Under these conditions, a price collar for offsets emerges as a largely overlooked policy option to foster investment incentives. A combination of offset quota and offset price collar leads to investment patterns that are almost identical to a regime without access to offsets.",Volume 49,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/49/suppl/C,7

"The new Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards increase fuel economy to 54.5 MPG by model year 2025 and determine fuel economy targets based on vehicle sizes. This paper examines the effect of the new CAFE standards on consumer choices and composition of vehicle sales, accounting for the impact of traffic safety. We first formulate and estimate a mixed logit model of consumer demand using micro-level data. Two measures of traffic safety, consumers’ safety concerns and traffic fatalities, are included and interacted with two vehicle characteristics that matter most for traffic safety: weight and size. Further, we conduct simulations of three extreme firm responses to assess the potential impact of the new CAFE standards: lightweighting, paying CAFE fines, and size increase. Simulation results suggest that the sales impact will fall almost entirely on the SUV and light truck segments and on US automakers that use lightweighting. Moreover, consumers in states with more traffic fatalities are the most responsive, shifting away from passenger cars. In addition, the new CAFE standards could result in an increase of 8.1 percent in the share of SUV and light trucks, which will cause as many as 347 more equivalent fatalities on roads each year.",Volume 49,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/49/suppl/C,7

Empirically, the estimates of the effects under the discontinuity-based OLS model have the opposite sign for some of the pollutants relative to the estimates from the basic OLS model.

"The paper investigates the provision of energy efficient products in a differentiated product market. We build a model to understand the provision of quality and energy efficiency in products when a tradeoff exists between these two product attributes represented by a technological frontier. In our model, a monopoly firm offers a high-end and a low-end version of a product to two groups of consumers who differ in their willingness to pay for the product. We find that the relative energy efficiency of the two products depends on the energy price. We show that price discrimination distorts the choice of energy efficiency and quality of the low-end product on the frontier. In addition, it may cause the firm to offer an energy efficiency/quality combination for the low-end product that is below the frontier, to induce the high-end consumers to buy the high-end product. This suggests that the firm’s desire to price discriminate in markets is one reason for the slow diffusion of energy saving technologies, a phenomenon known as the “energy paradox.” It also suggests that the technology to improve energy efficiency, even when available to firms, may not be fully utilized.",Volume 49,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/49/suppl/C,7
"Existing development literature has argued that natural-resource endowments “curse” economic prosperity by reducing expenditures on education. According to this theory, public and private agents lack sufficient foresight to make optimal economic decisions and become poor as a result. Using a panel of U.S. state-level data, this paper offers evidence to the contrary. Public spending on education in resource-rich states greatly exceeds that in resource-scarce ones, and private education services are imperfectly crowded out as a result. Analyzing a broader set of public education outcomes reveals that relative teacher salaries, public enrollment rates, and teacher–student ratios tend to move pro-cyclically with resource booms and busts. Weaker evidence is provided that graduation rates fall in response to resource booms, perhaps reflecting a rise in the opportunity cost of going to school for working-age students.",Volume 49,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/49/suppl/C,7
"Alert programs are central to strategies to reduce pollution exposure and manage its impact. To be effective alerts have to change behavior, but evidence that they do that is sparse. Indeed the majority of published studies fail to find a significant impact of alerts on the outcome behavior that they study. Alerts particularly seek to influence energetic cardio-vascular outdoor pursuits. This study is the first to use administrative data to show that they are effective in reducing participation in such a pursuit (namely cycle use in Sydney, Australia), and to our knowledge the first to show that they are effective in changing any behavior in a non-US setting. We are careful to disentangle possible reactions to realised air quality from the ‘pure’, causal effect of the issuance of an alert. Our results suggest that when an air quality alert is issued, the amount of cycling is reduced by 14–35%, which is a substantial behavioral response. The results are robust to the inclusion of a battery of controls in various combinations, alternative estimation methods and non-linear specifications.

This generates a marginal opportunity cost of using rainwater, since harvested water does not infiltrate. We first discuss the conditions that lead to a switch toward rainwater harvesting, then look at long-term rainwater harvesting systems. Due to limited storage capacity, long-term use of rainwater is only possible in conjunction with groundwater. We show that this only arises if the price of water is higher than the full marginal cost of rainwater harvesting. We also provide comparative statics related to this configuration, especially concerning the long-term water table.

"The energy intensities of the various industrial sectors differ considerably across countries. This suggests a potential for emissions reductions through improved accessibility to efficient technologies. This paper estimates an upper-bound CO2 emission mitigation potential that could theoretically be achieved by improved access to efficient technologies in industrial sectors. We develop a linear optimization framework that facilitates the exchange of sectoral production technologies based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), assuming perfect substitutability of technologies and homogeneity within economic sectors, while ignoring barriers to technological adoption and price driven adjustments. We consider the full global supply chain network and multiple upstream production inputs in addition to energy demand. In contrast to existing literature our framework allows to consider supply chain effects of technology replacements. We use our model to calculate emission reduction potentials for varying levels of access to technology. If best practice technologies were made available globally, CO2 emissions could theoretically be reduced by more than 10 gigatons (Gt). In fact, even second-tier production technologies would create significant global reduction potentials. We decompose sectoral emission reductions to identify contributions by changes in energy intensity, supply chain effects and changes in carbon intensities. Excluding the latter, we find that considering supply chain effects increases total mitigation potentials by 14%. The largest CO2 emission reduction potentials are found for a small set of developing countries.",Volume 49,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/49/suppl/C,7
"This study seeks to understand how materials scarcity and competition from alternative uses affects the potential for widespread deployment of solar electricity in the long run, in light of related technology and policy uncertainties. Simulation results of a computable partial equilibrium model show that materials scarcities constrain the expansion of solar generation. Solar photovoltaics expand with higher energy demand, squeezing consumption in industries that compete for scarce minerals. Stringent climate policies hamper growth in intermittent solar photovoltaics backed by fossil fuel powered plants, which is not compensated by small increases in non-intermittent concentrated solar power capacity. These findings underscore the significance of developing cost-effective alternatives to critical materials and low-cost electricity storage for economically sustainable climate change mitigation.",Volume 49,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/49/suppl/C,7
"Firms that extract and produce multiple metals are an important component of mineral supply. The reaction of such firms to changes in their relevant output prices is tested econometrically for five metals using a panel representing more than 100 mines across the time period 1991–2005. The estimation strategy is drawn from joint production theory, namely a flexible form, dual revenue approach with seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) estimation. The results indicate that multi-product mines respond (in the short run) to higher prices of a particular metal by reducing output of that metal (indicative of low-grading behavior) and increasing and/or decreasing output of joint metal products (indicative of substitutes and complements in supply). The price responses are not readily explained by a metal's classification as a by-product or main product based on revenue.",Volume 49,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/49/suppl/C,7
"This paper investigates the effect of learning on climate policy under fat tailed risk about climate change. We construct an endogenous learning model with fat-tailed uncertainty about the equilibrium climate sensitivity. We find that a decision maker with a possibility of learning lowers efforts to reduce carbon emissions relative to the no-learning case. The larger the tail effect, the larger the counteracting learning effect because learning reduces the marginal benefit of emissions control compared to the case where there is no learning. The optimal decisions (summarized by the carbon tax level) in the learning case are less sensitive to the true value of the uncertain variable than the decisions in the uncertainty case. Learning lets uncertainty converge to the true value of the state in the sense that the variance approaches zero as information accumulates.",Volume 48,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/48/suppl/C,8
"Many U.S. states have regulations that prevent natural gas utility companies from turning off service to non-paying consumers. The goal of these policies, termed “no shut-off” (NSO) regulations, is to provide a guaranteed minimum level of residential comfort by reducing the marginal cost of consumption to zero for a period of time. This paper employs a difference-in-difference approach applied to residential U.S. Energy Information Administration data to evaluate whether NSO policies generate higher levels of gas usage. Our preferred specifications suggest that activation of a NSO policy increases natural gas consumption by between 4.7–4.8%, resulting in a total increase of between 66 and 67 billion cubic feet of natural gas consumed per winter season in covered states, at a value of as much as $950–970 million annually.",Volume 48,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/48/suppl/C,8
"This paper measures the ‘emission intensity’ of the fifteen organized manufacturing and agricultural sectors in India. Our primary objective and contribution in this paper are in obtaining a direct relation between technological adoption (greater capitalization) and emission intensity at the industry level over a period of fourteen years between 1996 and 2009. We use the Environmentally Extended Input–Output (EEIO) model to calculate the direct, upstream and total emission intensity generated through the entire supply chain of production and consumption. From the fixed effects panel regression results we note that technological adoption helps to reduce emission intensity across industries, although, beyond a critical level it raises the intensity. Importantly, when better technologies are adopted for production of export goods as against non-traded goods, emission falls in a significant way.",Volume 48,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/48/suppl/C,8
"Resource management has to take account of the possibility of regime shifts in the ecological system that provides the resource. Regime shifts are uncertain and lead to structural changes in the system dynamics, lowering the carrying capacity of the resource. Optimal management is driven by two considerations. First, it becomes precautionary if a higher stock of the renewable resource decreases the hazard of a regime shift. Second, it either becomes precautionary or more aggressive depending on the adjustments that are needed after the regime shift. This in turn depends on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. In conclusion, facing the risk of a regime shift in the ecological system, optimal management is ambiguous but precautionary if the marginal hazard rate of the regime shift is sufficiently high.",Volume 48,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/48/suppl/C,8
"We develop a model of an opportunistic poacher harvesting a protected species within a protected area. A labor allocation problem is coupled with species population dynamics using a Gordon-Schafer framework in order to numerically estimate approach paths for population and poaching. Our model reveals that population dynamics can witness convergence to steady states, period-doubling bifurcation, and “deterministic” chaos for variations in policy parameters. We find that poaching fines, wage rates in and around protected areas, anti-poaching enforcement, and black market prices for the protected resource each have qualitatively different effects on population dynamics. Moreover, the effects differ significantly across a broad range of species. We find several instances of policy-induced counterintuitive population dynamics that result from unstable equilibriums in resource systems. Bifurcation diagrams and harvest feedback policies are derived to provide insight into counterintuitive dynamics that can arise in coupled ecological–economic systems.",Volume 48,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/48/suppl/C,8
"Increasing scarcity of water resources in many regions is likely to give rise to disputes similar to those observed in the Klamath region of Oregon and California where irrigation water buyback programs have been implemented to reduce irrigation diversions with the purpose of securing required instream flow for aquatic habitat. In this study using a mathematical programming approach we compare a direct water buyback program with an indirect, land idling based, program for securing required amount of water. We show that land idling based programs can be costlier than direct water buyback programs. Compensation for water idling directly, unlike land idling based programs, ensures that marginal water units with the lowest derived demand values are removed from production first.",Volume 48,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/48/suppl/C,8

Adherence to the law is associated with environmental gains, but also with losses in surpluses as firms incur abatement costs.

"There is widespread concern that a stringent international climate agreement will not be reached because it would imply too high costs for fast growing economies. To test this hypothesis we develop a general equilibrium model with fully endogenous growth and estimate the policy cost for China. The framework includes disaggregated industrial and energy sectors, endogenous innovation, and sector-specific investments. We find that the governmental target of a 65 percent carbon intensity reduction until 2030 causes a welfare reduction of 0.5 percent for China, compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Costs of carbon policy for China under an internationally coordinated emission reduction amount to 4 percent of total welfare. We highlight that lower economic growth, faster energy technology development, and stronger induced innovation reduce welfare losses significantly. Increased urbanization raises the policy costs because urban households consume more energy and energy intensive goods.",Volume 47,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/47/suppl/C,9
"In response to the perceived quality of a public good, households may choose to incur averting expenditures as a substitute to its aggregate provision, thereby revealing an (inverse) demand function. When unobserved heterogeneity affects both perceived quality and averting behavior, identification of the demand function is plagued by a problem of endogeneity. In this paper, we propose the use of an auxiliary (first stage) model of perceived quality as a function of objective quality to recover unbiased and microconsistent estimates of marginal willingness to pay for the provision of the public good. The approach can be applied when people have well-formed perceptions of the quality of the good, a prerequisite for the averting expenditures method, and when objective quality of provision is plausibly exogenous. We illustrate the approach with data on averting expenditures for two qualitative aspects of household tap water networks: water hardness and aesthetic quality in terms of taste and odor.",Volume 47,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/47/suppl/C,9
"This paper looks at whether bribes for electricity connections affect electricity reliability. Using detailed firm-level data, we estimate various specifications based upon repeated cross-sections and means-based pseudo-panels to show that bribes are closely related to poorer electricity reliability. We find that the propensity to bribe for an electricity connection is associated with an increase of 14 power outages per month and a 22% increase in annual sales lost due to power outages on average. The results parallel a tragedy of the commons story: electricity, which exhibits common-pool resource characteristics, suffers from overexploitation as self-interested individual firms rationally bribe for electricity, creating negative impacts in aggregate on the overall quality of the resource. Given the importance of electricity reliability for economic growth and development, the findings imply that improving oversight and enforcement measures at the consumer level that target the reduction of bribery for electricity connections could contribute to growth and development.",Volume 47,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/47/suppl/C,9
"This paper presents a two-regime differential game, with a first period in which two countries cooperate in a joint investment project to construct a specific infrastructure. This period ends when the infrastructure is finished, which serves to increase each player's welfare in a subsequent non-cooperative game played by the two countries thereafter. We define an imputation distribution procedure (IDP) to share the investment costs during cooperation according to each player’ future benefits. We prove that the IDP is time consistent if at any time within the cooperative period each country's share on the surplus to go is equal to or converges towards the country's relative gains from the existence of the infrastructure (realized in the subsequent non-cooperative period). Furthermore, we obtain the instantaneous side-payment scheme which makes the IDP feasible. The mechanism is studied for a joint investment project to build a water canal to transfer water between a surplus and a deficit river basin.",Volume 47,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/47/suppl/C,9

Theoretically, we derive conditions under which donations may serve as substitutes or complements for the consumption of private and impure public goods. We then empirically test our predictions in the context of climate change mitigation using data from online-representative surveys among citizens in Germany and the U.S. Our empirical results indicate a rather complementary relationship between offsetting and other pro-environmental activities in both countries, although individuals substitute certain clean consumption alternatives by offsetting if they lay a sufficiently large weight on environmental preference or if offsetting is perceived to be relatively effective in providing the public good climate protection.",Volume 47,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/47/suppl/C,9
"The US Endangered Species Act (ESA) regulates what landowners, land managers, and industry can do on lands occupied by listed species. The ESA does this in part by requiring the designation of habitat within each listed species’ range considered critical to their recovery. Critics have argued that critical habitat (CH) designation creates significant economic costs while contributing little to species recovery. Here we examine the effects of CH designation on land cover change. We find that the rate of change from 1992 to 2011 in developed (urban and residential) and agricultural land in CH areas was not significantly different compared to similar lands without CH designation, but still subject to ESA regulations. Although CH designation on average does not affect overall rates of land cover change, CH designation did slightly modify the impact of land cover change drivers. Generally, variation in land prices played a larger role in land cover decisions within CH areas than in similar areas without CH designation. These trends suggest that developers may require a greater than typical expected return to development in CH areas to compensate for the higher risk of regulatory scrutiny. Ultimately, our results bring into question the very rationale for the CH regulation. If it is for the most part not affecting land cover choices, is CH helping species recover?",Volume 47,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/47/suppl/C,9
"Time-invariant electricity pricing does not reflect daily variation in the cost of producing electricity and thus can cause economic inefficiency. Time-of-use pricing (TOU), which has higher electricity prices during peak hours and lower prices during non-peak hours, is a pricing scheme that can help achieve more efficient levels of electricity consumption. This study examines factors influencing consumers’ participation in voluntary TOU programs with particular attention to individual-specific risk and time preferences elicited through multiple price-list experiments. Evidence from a study of 398 homeowners in Arizona and California, U.S., indicates that more risk averse consumers are less likely to enroll in TOU programs. The results suggest evidence of adverse selection, with households who consume less energy during peak hours being more likely to enroll in TOU programs. Time preferences are found to have a statistically significant and negative impact on consumers’ adoption of programmable thermostats, a technology that can allow households to better respond to TOU pricing. However, we find no evidence that consumers’ decisions to enroll in TOU programs and adopt programmable thermostats are correlated. Our results have important implications for policymakers and utility companies, which attempt to increase participation in voluntary TOU programs.",Volume 47,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/47/suppl/C,9

Our study area consists of two counties in Pennsylvania that are home to large amounts of unconventional natural gas extraction but are otherwise isolated from other resource extraction industries or large urban areas. We deploy parametric, semi-parametric, and matching hedonic regression models that include recent quasi-experimental methods and, in contrast to previous research and much popular intuition, we fail to find robust significance that negative environmental externalities of natural gas extraction are manifested in nearby property values.

"We study how much private mineral owners capture geologically-driven advantages in well productivity through a higher royalty rate. Using proprietary data from nearly 1.8 million leases, we estimate that the six major shale plays generated $39 billion in private royalties in 2014. There is limited pass-through of resource abundance into royalty rates. A doubling of the ultimate recovery of the average well in a county increases the average royalty rate by 1–2 percentage points (a 6–11 percent increase). Thus, mineral owners benefit from resource abundance primarily through a quantity effect, not through negotiating better lease terms from extraction firms. The low pass-through likely reflects a combination of firms exercising market power in private leasing markets and uncertainty over the value of resource endowments.",Volume 46,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/46/suppl/C,10
"As a needed methodological complement to the existing large-scale complex policy modelling for energy technology diffusion, this paper contributes to an analytical exposition of the fundamental mechanism of international technology diffusion (ITD) for energy technological progress. We offer two different and complementary perspectives to explore the dynamics of energy technology diffusion and progress. We first develop a Solow-type efficiency-improving model of energy technological progress which is described by improvements in primary energy-augmenting efficiency. We further provide a Romer-type variety-expanding model of energy technological progress which is represented by the expansion of differentiated varieties of primary energy technology blueprints. Analysis based on two different models reaches consistent results: there are potential forces in the world economy – working through ITD – that pull individual countries to advance energy technology, ensuring a cross-country convergence in the growth rates of energy technology in the balanced growth path. While ITD plays a role in a cross-country convergence in technological growth rates, cross-country differences in the efficiency of undertaking indigenous research and the capacity of absorbing foreign technology spillovers would lead to a cross-country divergence in the absolute levels of energy technology.",Volume 46,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/46/suppl/C,10
"This study examines the convergence of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions among a panel of U.S. states between the period 1960–2010. This examination is carried out by means of a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, we conduct an endogenous grouping, regression-based convergence test. Unlike previous studies, this methodology endogenously identifies groups of states with emissions that are converging to a similar steady state growth path over time. In the second stage, we evaluate the conditional rate of convergence for the whole sample and for each club using panel data, fixed effects models that control for unobserved, time-invariant heterogeneous effects. More specifically, we examine the rates of convergence conditional on certain structural and non-structural characteristics of the state economy. Results from stage one and stage two suggest that one group of twenty-six states is converging to a unique steady-state equilibrium, and otherwise, the remaining states are diverging. Finally, we discuss different policy approaches to mitigating carbon dioxide emissions based on the club convergence hypothesis.",Volume 46,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/46/suppl/C,10
"In order to reduce CO2 emissions and mitigate climate change, several countries around the world have introduced a CO2 tax on energy consumption. Switzerland has already introduced a CO2 tax on gas and heating oil and is considering introducing a CO2 tax on gasoline and diesel as well. The effectiveness of such a tax depends on the level of the short- and long-run price elasticity. Moreover, acceptance of a CO2 tax by a society depends on both the distributional effects of such a tax among households and its spatial effects among regions. In this paper, the regional impact of a hypothetical CO2 tax on gasoline consumption in Switzerland is analysed by estimating a demand function for gasoline using panel data from 547 Swiss municipalities from 2001 to 2008. Gasoline sales were collected from the five largest gasoline companies operating in Switzerland, covering about 60% of overall sales. Swiss municipalities are relatively small units, and car ownership and use in one municipality is thought to influence gasoline sales in the neighbouring ones. Accordingly, the method used in the model also accounts for spatial correlation in the consumption of gasoline. Overall, our spatial econometric analysis shows that the tax burden of a CO2 tax will be higher in rural areas than in urban areas.",Volume 46,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/46/suppl/C,10
"We identify two possible open-loop equilibrium configurations for a non-renewable resource duopoly in a discrete-time framework. For the purpose of illustration, we characterize initial endowments of firms that allow for a maximum of two extraction periods. In the first possible equilibrium, the duopoly exists for two periods, while in the second possible equilibrium, the duopoly lasts only for one period and the firm with the higher initial endowment becomes a monopolist in the second and last period. As neither equilibrium configuration dominates the other for both firms at the same time, it is unclear whether firms acting simultaneously can coordinate on one particular configuration.",Volume 46,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/46/suppl/C,10
"Meta-analyses of interfuel and capital-energy elasticities of substitution show that elasticity estimates are dependent on the type of data − time series, panel, or cross-section − and the estimators used. Econometric theory suggests that the between estimator might generate the best estimates of long-run elasticities but no existing estimates of elasticities of substitution have used it. Alternatively, Chirinko et al. argued in favor of estimating long-run elasticities of substitution using a long-run difference estimator. We provide estimates of China’s interfuel and interfactor elasticities of substitution using the between and long-run difference estimators. To address potential omitted variables bias, we add province level inefficiency and national technological change terms to our regression model. The results show that demand for coal and electricity in China is very inelastic, while demand for diesel and gasoline is elastic. With the exception of gasoline and diesel, there are limited substitution possibilities among the fuels. Substitution possibilities are greater between energy and labor than between energy and capital. The results are quite different to some previous studies for China but coincide well with the patterns found in meta-analyses for long-run estimates of elasticities of substitution.",Volume 46,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/46/suppl/C,10
"To be relevant to developing countries, green growth must be reconciled with the two key structural features of natural resource use and poverty in these countries. First, primary products account for the majority of their export earnings, and they are unable to diversify from primary production. Second, many economies have a substantial share of their rural population located on less favored agricultural land and in remote areas, thus encouraging “geographic” poverty traps. If green growth is to be a catalyst for economy-wide transformation and poverty alleviation in developing countries, then it must be accompanied by policies aimed directly at overcoming these two structural features. Policies and reforms should foster forward and backward linkages of primary production, enhance its integration with the rest of the economy, and improve opportunities for innovation and knowledge spillovers. Rural poverty, especially the persistent concentration of the rural poor on less favored agricultural lands and in remote areas, needs to be addressed by additional targeted policies and investments, and where necessary, policies to promote rural-urban migration.",Volume 45,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/45/suppl/C,11
"This paper analyses the impact of several avoided deforestation policies within a patchy forested landscape. Central is the idea that one neighbour's deforestation actions may impact the returns to deforestation in nearby patches. We determine the impact of each policy in terms of avoided deforestation and leakage levels at the landscape scale through modelling and simulations. Avoided deforestation policies at a landscape level are respectively: two Payment for Environmental Services (PES) policies, one focused on deforestation hotspots, the second being equally available to all agents; a conservation area; and, an agglomeration bonus. Because our model accommodates spatial interactions in the absence of a deforestation policy, it is possible that a spatial policy can affect both within-intervention areas and outside-intervention spatial spillovers in terms of leakage across different landowners’ forest patches. These two different elements of the total extent of displacement across the full landscape have not been considered before. Our contribution is twofold. In terms of methodology, we expand the concept of leakage in accounting for direct impacts to adjacent patches and spatial spillovers over the landscape, and we provide a measure of leakage in a dynamic manner for policy assessment. From our analytical model and simulations, we show that leakage is sensitive to the spatial distribution of forest patch types. The two PES policies are the most cost-effective policies regarding avoided deforestation. The agglomeration bonus policy is efficient at the expense of a higher cost, whilst the conservation area policy is efficient when patches with similar characteristics are gathered.",Volume 45,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/45/suppl/C,11
"The energy extraction boom of the mid 2000s impacted local economies in areas with substantial shale oil and gas reserves. I examine the impact of the energy boom on the labor market by exploiting a natural experiment in the Marcellus region. In particular, I compare counties with fracking activity in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to the control group of counties in New York, which imposed a moratorium and later ban on fracking. I look at how the benefits to the labor demand shock are shared between industries as well as how employment and wages in related industries adjust over the course of the resource boom. The results suggest total employment and wages per job increase by 7% and 11% respectively above pre-boom levels in the three years after the boom, but decline after 4 years or more.

"Environmental quality is a public good, potentially impacted by everybody. Individual level pro-environmental behavior affects environmental quality in the aggregate. Therefore, it is important to understand what causes individual’s pro-environmental behaviors to change. We quantify the causal effect of one determinant, unemployment, using an EU-27 population representative Eurobarometer survey. Drawing on results from the theory of the private provision of public goods, and recognizing that unemployment decreases income and the opportunity cost of time, we formulate testable predictions that unemployment will decrease the extent of pro-environmental behaviors that require monetary contributions and increase the extent of pro-environmental behaviors that mainly require time/effort. Instrumental variables regressions provide empirical evidence to support these hypotheses. Changes in the unemployment rate within a sub-national region provide the exogenous variation needed to identify the causal effect. Several supplemental questions on the survey provide evidence that environmental issues lose saliency and economic issues gain saliency when one becomes unemployed, suggesting that interested parties may wish to emphasize cost savings of pro-environmental behavior rather than environmental benefits during times of increased unemployment.",Volume 45,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/45/suppl/C,11
"India's groundwater extraction is heavily dependent on diesel pumps, and one reason is the lack of reliable power supply. The widespread use of diesel pumps is an economic problem due to the inefficiency and high cost of said pumps. Could rural electrification improve the situation? We estimate the relationship between village electrification and the counts of electric and diesel pumps in India, 1982–1999. We find that, in addition to increasing the number of electric pumps, rural electrification also greatly increases the number of diesel pumps. While initially surprising, these results make sense in an environment characterized by frequent power outages and constant quality problems. If rural electrification increases the number of electric pumps and promotes irrigated agriculture, the demand for diesel pumps also grows because many farmers need a reliable pump that does not depend on electricity. Without improvements in the supply of electricity through rational power sector reforms, India cannot stop the spread of diesel pumps through rural electrification.

"In this study, we investigated global economic and environmental resilience in the presence of climate change. In particular, we examine the possibility of mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions without stressing standards of living. Here, we set up a cross-country CO2 market constrained by a quota, where CO2 is optimally re-allocated based on relative shadow prices of the pollutant. The objective is to stabilize global emissions without hindering global incomes and in the process achieve a single CO2 price. We introduce a re-allocation model that takes into account each country’s underlying polluting technology. The model solutions are then used to investigate whether a single, global price for CO2 is attainable. Our results suggest that global CO2 emissions could stabilize without stressing global incomes, with a global CO2 market achieving equilibrium. With a CO2 market, countries would then have the incentive to consider adopting, improving, or investing in additional abatement technologies to move beyond current capabilities, while continuing to increase standards of living.",Volume 45,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/45/suppl/C,11

I use information in the drilling histories of firms exploring Alberta for oil and gas to estimate various models of exploration rates. The objective is to study how the outcomes of previous exploration decisions, under both private-information and public-information assumptions, as well as timing, influence firms’ exploration rates across Alberta. The results show that firms’ exploration rates were influenced by both its own drilling history as well as by the outcomes of other firms. The drilling histories of other firms had important effects on a firm's decision to explore a region if the firm had yet to start exploring that region. However, once a firm had started to explore a region, the outcomes of rivals were less important than the firm's own outcomes.

The former dimension refers to the pure (intrinsic) performance of the good, whereas the latter dimension has a positional content: buying green goods satisfies the consumer's desire to be portrayed as a socially worthy citizen. We consider the case in which these quality dimensions are in conflict with each other so that the higher the hedonic quality of a good, the lower the corresponding environmental quality.

We fill this gap by combining an analysis of outage vulnerability with an examination of infrastructure acceptability using a unique data set from 15 EU countries with household-level information on both aspects of power provision. We find only limited evidence of a positive relationship between local residents’ sensitivity to outages and their acceptability of new energy infrastructure projects.

The analysis takes into account that capacity investment must be chosen under uncertainty about demand conditions and capacity availability, and that capacity as well as electricity generation may be sources of externalities. The main result is that generation subsidies should correspond to externalities of electricity generation (e.g., greenhouse gas reductions), and investment subsidies should correspond to externalities of capacity (e.g., learning spillovers). If only capacity externalities exist, then electricity generation should not be subsidized at all. Our results suggest that some of the most popular promotion instruments cause welfare losses.

At the same time, there is some tentative evidence suggesting that oil rich nations tend to under-report data on income inequality, which can potentially influence the estimated empirical relationships between oil richness and income inequality. In this paper we contribute to the literature in a twofold manner. First, we explore in depth the empirical relationship between oil and income inequality by making use of the Standardized World Income Inequality Database – the most comprehensive dataset on income inequality providing comparable data for the broadest set of country-year observations. Second, this is the first study to our knowledge that adopts an empirical framework to examine whether oil rich nations tend to under-report data on income inequality and the possible implications thereof. We make use of Heckman selection models to validate the tendency of oil rich countries to under-report and correct for the bias that might arise as a result of this – we find that oil is associated with lower income inequality with the exception of the very oil-rich economies.",Volume 45,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/45/suppl/C,11
"This study examines the extent of environmental management practiced by U.S. chemical manufacturing facilities, as measured by the number of environmental internal audits conducted by facilities annually. In particular, this study focuses on the effects of firm-level organizational structure on facility-level environmental management practices. For its theoretical analysis, the study employs the framework of signaling, including both signals sent to customers and signals sent to regulators. For its empirical analysis, the study exploits unique data gathered by a survey distributed to all U.S. chemical manufacturing permitted to discharge wastewater as of 2001; the survey data provide information on audits conducted annually between the years 1999 and 2001. As one example, empirical results reveal a difference in auditing behavior based on whether facilities are owned by firms operating within a single state or multiple states.",Volume 44,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/44/suppl/C,12
"This paper investigates the coordination problem in transboundary species invasions. When invasions impact commodity markets and control decisions are made by many producers, a spatial externality arises due to market-level impacts and delaying the invasion on neighboring parcels. We illustrate how the intrinsic spread rate and the spatial configuration of producers interact to determine the public benefits of private control decisions and the ultimate outcome of species invasions on private property. To coordinate responses to invasions at the market level, a corrective mechanism is suggested in which invaded producers are compensated by all other producers for control actions that alleviate impacts to other producers.",Volume 44,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/44/suppl/C,12
"Promoting energy efficiency by undertaking a market-oriented reform of the energy-pricing mechanism is one of the top priorities of China's ongoing reform effort. In this study, we examine the impacts of China's gasoline-pricing reform implemented in January 2009 on the fuel economy of the country's new automotive fleet. In particular, we distinguish the effects of two common elements of China's energy-pricing reform packages: the effects of the energy tax increase (i.e., the gasoline tax increase) and the effects of the energy-pricing mechanism reform (i.e., the adoption of a market-oriented pricing scheme for gasoline). By exploiting a rich dataset of monthly new passenger vehicle sales at the vehicle-model level in China between 2008 and 2013, we are able to control for potential correlations between unobserved product and consumer characteristics and products’ fuel efficiency. Our empirical results infer that fuel costs have a significant influence on new vehicle sales in China, while the presented policy simulations suggest that the gasoline-pricing reform in China has led to an approximately 6.25 percent increase in new vehicle fuel economy. Moreover, the two major elements of the reform, the gasoline tax increase and expedited adjustment cycles for gasoline prices, make similar contributions to the increase in the new vehicle fleet's fuel economy, with the former contributing 3.43 percent and the latter, 2.82 percent.",Volume 44,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/44/suppl/C,12
"This study examines the factors that influence households to adopt modifications recommended by home energy audits and whether these audits lead to significant reductions in electricity use. Household decisions after the audits are recorded along with the corresponding recommended modifications and the offers for co-funding. A discrete choice model of the household decision after the audit is estimated. The results indicate that the potential improvement in heating efficiency from the proposed modifications increase the probability of implementing conservation measures. Co-funding offers also significantly raise the odds of accepting the modifications but are relatively less important than anticipated efficiency improvements. Several approaches are used to determine whether and how much energy is saved after the audits. Electricity demand models are estimated using data two years before and after each household audit. For households who decide to modify their houses after the audit, monthly average electricity use per square foot decreases 7%. While there is an estimated 2% reduction in electricity use attributed to the audit by households who decided not to adopt the proposed modifications, this reduction is not statistically significant, casting doubt on the presence of modifications in behavior from the audit information itself. For all households audited, the results from the electricity demand models suggest that the LVE home energy audit program reduced household electricity use 4.7%. In contrast, a differences-in-differences approach using synthetic control groups based upon a smaller but still sizeable sample of 2000 observations finds that home energy audits reduce household electricity use by more than 10%. Overall, these findings suggest that home audits result in modest but significant reductions in energy use and that co-funding encourages investments that otherwise may not be privately optimal.",Volume 44,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/44/suppl/C,12
"This paper offers new evidence concerning the difference in consumers’ reactions to changes in gasoline taxes relative to market-induced changes in gasoline prices. Using microdata from the 2007 to 2009 rounds of the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey, we estimate a complete system of demand augmented with information on gasoline excise taxes. By relying on a complete system of demand, we are able to estimate elasticities that take behavioral responses into account. Crucially, the model allows gasoline taxes to affect demand in two distinct ways: through relative prices and as long-run policy signals. Different increases in gasoline taxes are considered for simulation. A 13.2 ¢/gallon tax increase, corresponding to a $15/tCO2 carbon tax, is found to cause, in the long run, a reduction in gasoline demand that is about seven times as big as that induced by an equal market-induced price increase. The same measure of differential demand response is derived for tax increases different in size as well as by income quintile and by region. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of corrective taxation in the private transport sector.",Volume 44,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/44/suppl/C,12
"Many river sharing agreements in transboundary river basins are inherently unstable. Due to stochastic river flow, agreements may be broken in case of drought. The objective of this paper is to analyze whether river sharing agreements can be self-enforcing, or sustainable. We do so using an infinitely-repeated sequential game that we apply to several classes of agreements. To derive our main results we apply the equilibrium concepts of subgame-perfect equilibrium and renegotiation-proof equilibrium to the river sharing problem. We show that, given the upstream–downstream asymmetry, sustainable agreements allow downstream agents to reap the larger share of the benefits of cooperation.",Volume 44,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/44/suppl/C,12
"Oil and natural gas reservoirs typically span multiple productive leases so that no owner has rights to the entire stock of resource, resulting in production externalities. Previous literature has examined the effectiveness of government regulation in Texas and Oklahoma in abating these externalities, finding Oklahoma to be more successful in unifying common pools and securing property rights. Using regression discontinuity design, we quantify the impact of regulatory difference between the two states. We find that Oklahoma produces an average of 3361 more barrels of oil over the life of a well, relative to Texas. Given the maturity of the fields in question, the result underscores the continuing importance of addressing common pool externalities even after the primary phase of recovery has largely been completed.",Volume 44,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/44/suppl/C,12
"We suggest a development-compatible refunding system designed to mitigate climate change. Industrial countries pay an initial fee into a global fund. Each country chooses its national carbon tax. Part of the global fund is refunded to developing and industrial countries, in proportion to the relative emissions reductions they achieve. Countries receive refunds net of tax revenues. We show that such a scheme can simultaneously achieve efficient emissions reductions and equity objectives, as developing countries do not have to pay an initial fee, are net receivers of funds, are net beneficiaries, and abate voluntarily. Moreover, we explore the potential of simple and politically more acceptable refunding schemes that do not claim tax revenues and only rely on initial fees paid by industrial countries.",Volume 44,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/44/suppl/C,12
"Reducing the quantity of waste is an objective pursued by an increasing number of governments. Pricing waste has been one of the most important tools used for that purpose, and the literature on the demand for household waste disposal shows a wide diversity of price elasticity calculations. We explore this issue by means of a meta-analysis on a database of 25 studies. This allows us analyzing which is the effect on the results of different data, model specification and (statistical) methods. We find no evidence that either treating prices as exogenous or including curbside recycling effects in the model influence price elasticity. There are some indications that price elasticities in the USA are more elastic, and that municipal data provide higher estimates than household data. We find that much of the variation in elasticities is associated with substantial methods; in particular it can be explained by the use of a weight-based system and by the pricing of compostable waste. In contrast, the bag-based system does not present a significant relation with elasticity. Finally, our results do not find evidence of publication bias, while they do indicate some evidence of the existence of a true empirical effect.",Volume 44,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/44/suppl/C,12
"The paper analyzes the strategic behavior of several countries engaged in capital accumulation, pollution mitigation, and environmental adaptation in the context of an environmental common good. Both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies are discussed. The non-cooperative strategy is a dynamic game in which each country makes its own environmental decision following the open-loop Nash equilibrium. The cooperative social planner problem assumes an international environmental agreement in force. The non-cooperative and cooperative solutions are compared in the symmetric case of two countries and extended to several identical countries. It is shown that the non-cooperative strategy in multi-country world leads to over-production, over-consumption, over-pollution, and over-adaptation.",Volume 44,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/44/suppl/C,12

"In this paper we explore whether privatization helps to catalyze a firm's environmental research and development (ER&D) and improve environmental quality. By defining ER&D as the effort undertaken by a firm to reduce its pollution per unit of output, we find in a duopoly framework that privatization cannot catalyze both public and private firms’ ER&D efforts simultaneously; it can increase one but decrease the other firm's investment, or it may even lower both firms’ ER&D investments. Moreover, when production causes severe environmental damage, or the imposition of environmental taxes poorly internalize the pollution externality, privatization may result in a poorer environment. For the sake of having a cleaner environment, policy-makers can impose higher environmental taxes on a highly polluting industry when it is being privatized.",Volume 43,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/43/suppl/C,13

Results show that, state-owned power plants are least efficient relative to the meta-frontier. A further 44 percent of total CO2 emissions can be cut if all power plants are completely efficient.

"Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have the potential to contribute to a sustainable transport system with zero tailpipe emissions. This requires the construction of a network of fuel stations, a long-term, expensive and highly uncertain investment. We contribute to the literature by including a knock-out barrier option in an n-fold compound real option model to take account of immediate project failure in a multi-stage sequential investment project. Our model allows to explicitly incorporate the default possibility of large-scale energy infrastructure projects. In our case study of hydrogen infrastructure development, we find that even for the least conservative valuation method no profitable business case can be made for the development of hydrogen as a sustainable transportation mode. However, we do provide some suggestive scenarios that plausible tax schedules can be designed to overcome the starting problems for hydrogen infrastructure development.",Volume 43,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/43/suppl/C,13
"Econometric modelling of decision uncertainty has received extensive attention in the contingent valuation literature, but these methods are not directly transferable to the realm of multi-attribute stated preference studies. In this paper, an integrated choice and latent variable model tracing the impact of decision uncertainty on the valuation of flood risk reductions in the Netherlands is developed. The proposed model structure is not subject to the potential endogeneity bias and measurement error issues associated with most applied methods. The driving factors of decision uncertainty are identified through stated choices and a set of self-reported decision uncertainty follow-up questions. The model simultaneously accounts for the impact of decision uncertainty on individual choices and welfare estimates. In the presented case study uncertain respondents are found to make more random choices and select the opt out option more often. Willingness-to-pay for flood risk reductions increases after accounting for these behavioural responses to decision uncertainty.",Volume 43,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/43/suppl/C,13
"The green paradox conveys the idea that climate policies may have unintended side effects when taking into account the reaction of fossil fuel suppliers. The prospect of carbon taxes being implemented in the future induces resource owners to extract more rapidly which increases present carbon dioxide emissions and accelerates global warming. However, our results suggest that future carbon taxes may decrease present emissions if resource owners face increasing marginal extraction costs and if there is a clean energy source that is a perfect substitute and exhibits learning-by-doing (LBD).If the marginal extraction cost curve is sufficiently flat, resource owners respond to a future carbon tax by lowering total extraction and only slightly increasing present extraction. Moreover, taxation leads to higher energy prices which induces renewable energy firms to increase output not only in the future, but also in the present because of the anticipated benefits from LBD. This crowds out energy from the combustion of fossil fuels and may outweigh the initial increase in present extraction, leading to less emissions in the present.",Volume 43,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/43/suppl/C,13

"Forest harvests are a possible source of second-generation wood-based bioenergy. The carbon stored in the forest is highest when there is little or no harvest from the forest. Increasing the harvest from a forest, in order to produce more bioenergy, may thus conflict with the direct benefit of the forest as a carbon sink. We analyze this conflict using a simple model where bioenergy and fossil energy are perfect substitutes.

Results show that there is potential to improve energy efficiency for fuel and electricity use in all sectors; energy intensity is not an appropriate proxy for energy efficiency; the EU ETS had a modest or no effect on Swedish firms’ efficient use of energy during the first trading phase and the beginning of the second, indicating that the carbon permit price was too low to generate the necessary incentives for energy efficiency investments.",Volume 43,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/43/suppl/C,13
"Despite widespread global efforts to promote clean cookstoves to achieve improvements in air and forest quality, and to reduce global climate change, surprisingly little is known about the degree to which these actually reduce biomass fuel consumption in real-world settings. Using data from in-house weighing of fuel conducted in rural India, we examine the impact of cleaner cookstoves ⿿ most of which are LPG stoves ⿿ on three key outcomes related to solid fuel use. Our results suggest that using a clean cookstove is associated with daily reductions of about 4.5 kg of biomass fuel, 160 fewer minutes cooking on traditional stoves, and 105 fewer minutes collecting biomass fuels. These findings of substantial savings are robust to the use of estimators with varying levels of control for selection, and to alternative data obtained from household self-reports. Our results support the idea that efforts to promote clean stoves among poor rural households can reduce solid fuel use and cooking time, and that rebound effects toward greater amounts of cooking on multiple stoves are not sufficient to eliminate these gains. We also find, however, that households who have greater wealth, fewer members, are in less marginalized groups, and practice other health-averting behaviors, are more likely to use these cleaner stoves, which suggests that socio-economic status plays an important role in determining who benefits from such technologies. Future efforts to capture social benefits must therefore consider how to promote the use of alternative technologies by poor households, given that these households are least likely to own clean stoves.",Volume 43,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/43/suppl/C,13
"This study investigates induced productivity effects of firms introducing new environmental technologies. The literature on within-firm organisational change and productivity suggests that firms can achieve higher productivity gains from adopting new technologies if they adapt their organisational structures. Such complementarity effects may be of particular importance for the adoption of greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement technologies. The adoption of these technologies is often induced by public authorities to limit the social costs of climate change, whereas the private returns are much less obvious. This study finds empirical support for complementarity between green technology adoption (either CO2-reducing or resources and energy efficiency-enhancing technologies) and organisational change. While the sole adoption of green technologies is associated with lower productivity, the simultaneous implementation of green technologies and organisational innovations is not.",Volume 43,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/43/suppl/C,13

This paper examines bycatch in a multi-sector fishery in which the gear of one sector is imperfectly selective while in the other it is perfectly selective. In the model, the two stocks are biologically independent so the fisheries are only linked through the nonselective harvest externality. An important difference between this paper and prior work is that the bycatch problem and its solution are examined in a dynamic context.

This topic is of interest, especially since the Stern report and the ensuing public and academic debate have made clear how crucial discounting is for evaluating anti-global warming measures. We investigate the consequences of the assumption that discounting is endogenous, more precisely, decreases as the damage increases, i.e., decision makers become more patient when facing the environmental damages following their high consumption levels. This avoids time inconsistency, a pitfall when using hyperbolic discounting. However, it can lead to quite different and sometimes counterintuitive behavior in comparison to standard exogenous discounting: an endogenous discount rate, albeit always smaller than the exogenous one, (i) can nevertheless imply high stationary damages; (ii) can lead to multiple steady states.",Volume 42,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/42/suppl/C,14
"Random utility models have been widely employed in environmental valuation. But stochastic choice set formation models in the random utility framework are rarely applied in this literature, although previous research has shown that ignoring choice set formation (when it exists) leads to biased parameter estimates and welfare measures. This paper conducts Monte Carlo (MC) experiments to investigate the directionality and magnitude of welfare measure bias arising from ignoring or misspecifying choice set formation. We find that when attribute cutoff-based choice set formation exists in the data generation process, typical RUM models ignoring or misspecifying choice set formation underestimate welfare measures by 30–50%. Models that approximate choice set formation may produce unbiased welfare measures, but constitute a promising area for future research.

"Using renewable energy for domestic consumption has been identified as a key strategy by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Critical to the success of this strategy is to know whether consumers are willing to pay to increase the proportion of electricity generated from renewable energy in their electricity portfolio. There are a number of studies in the literature that report a wide range of willingness to pay estimates. In this study, we used a meta-regression analysis to determine how much of the variation in willingness to pay reflects true differences across the population and how much is due to study design, such as survey design and administration, and model specification. The results showed that factors that influence willingness to pay, such as renewable energy type, consumers’ socio-economic profile and consumers’ energy consumption patterns, explain less variation in willingness to pay estimates than the characteristics of the study design itself. Because of this effect, we recommend that policy makers exercise caution when interpreting and using willingness to pay results from primary studies. Our meta-regression analysis further shows that consumers have significantly higher willingness to pay for electricity generated from solar, wind or generic renewable energy source (i.e. not a specific source) than hydro power or biomass.",Volume 42,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/42/suppl/C,14
"Moral objections to quota trade are common in public discussion. The underlying moral reasoning is often hard to extract from the public's rhetoric, and economists often claim that the objections are due to misunderstandings. In this paper we test experimentally one possible objection to trading emission rights: that selling pollution rights is objectionable because it involves trade in the right to do something wrong. The experiment is phrased in a neutral language to avoid invoking subjects’ prior attitudes to trading pollution permits. In the experiment, subjects earn money from using stickers that inflict losses on others. After the initial rounds, the use of stickers is limited and the rights to use stickers are tradable. We observe no reluctance to trade these rights compared to a control treatment with identical incentives but no externalities. In a final stage, subjects vote on whether stickers should be tradable or not. Subjects in both treatments are almost unanimous in the support to trade. A majority of third party subjects asked to judge the experimental procedures, however, indicated that the market made the use of stickers seem more moral. A post experiment survey showed that our subject pool had a negative attitude to real life trade of emission quota. The experiment finds no indication that this attitude is due to a concern over tradable quotas legitimizing morally objectionable actions.",Volume 42,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/42/suppl/C,14
"We analyse the impact of two different generation techniques used by fringe suppliers on the intensity of competition in the electricity wholesale market. For that purpose, we derive a Cournot model of this market taking into account long-term contracts, international trade and fringe suppliers using different energy generating technologies. We apply this model to the Dutch market and estimate the impact of fringe supply on the Lerner index. We find that the fringe supply coming from both intermittent wind generation and combined heat and power (CHP) plants operated by horticultural farmers increases competition, which leads to lower prices in the electricity market. However, this impact is relatively small. The effect per unit of intermittent wind electricity generation on competition and, therefore, prices is stronger than that of the CHP technology.",Volume 42,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/42/suppl/C,14

Revisions of expectations of success were statistically significant but economically less important. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, concentration of ownership encouraged entry.

"Energy-intensive infrastructure may tie up fossil energy use and carbon emissions for a long time after investment, and thus be crucial for the ability to control long-run emissions. Much or most of the resulting carbon emissions can often be eliminated later, through a retrofit that may however be costly. This paper studies the joint decision to invest in such infrastructure, and retrofit it later, given that future climate damages are uncertain and follow a geometric Brownian motion process with positive drift. We find that higher climate cost volatility (for given unconditional expected costs) then delays the retrofit decision by increasing the option value of waiting to invest. The initial infrastructure is also chosen with higher energy intensity, further increasing total emissions, when volatility is higher. We provide conditions under which higher climate cost volatility increases total expected discounted climate damage from the infrastructure, which happens in a wide set of circumstances.",Volume 41,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/41/suppl/C,15

We use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Canadian economy and disaggregate households into deciles by annual income using data from a large household expenditure survey. Using the model, we find that the existing BC carbon tax is highly progressive even prior to consideration of the revenue recycling scheme, such that the negative impact of the carbon tax on households with below-median income is smaller than that on households with above-median income. We show that our finding is a result of welfare effects of a carbon tax being determined primarily by the source of a households’ income rather than by the destination of its expenditures. Finally, we show that the existing revenue recycling scheme is also progressive.

However, the literature does not establish a significant impact of socially responsible investing on stock market returns. We develop a coherent economic framework of responsible investing to address this paradox. The framework offers theoretical underpinnings for all research on responsible investment as it provides the theoretical underpinnings for the actual behavior of market participants. We associate corporate social performance with key financial accounting ratios like the market-to-book ratio (market value of the firm in relation to accounting value), return on assets, and stock market return. We conclude that there is a strong theoretical foundation for a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance, though the relation is conditional on which financial performance measure is considered.

As a result, it has been suggested to include an Instruction Choice Set (ICS) prior to the choices used for generating benefit estimates. However, an ICS may induce a starting point effect biasing Willingness to Pay (WTP) estimates. Subsequent choices may not only be influenced by the levels of the cost attribute, but also by the levels of the non-cost attributes shown in the ICS. Using a split sample treatment, we investigate whether starting point effects are induced by the inclusion of ICSs depending on different combinations of cost and non-cost attribute levels. Employing data from a CE on water quality changes, we test whether a starting point effect related to the design of the ICS exists, and whether effects differ in terms of the number of status quo choices and WTP estimates. The results indicate that the ICS designs do influence WTP without entailing strong learning effects. Therefore, inclusion of an ICS might cause ‘more harm than good’. If, however, an ICS inclusion is nonetheless judged to be beneficial, we recommend to design them carefully in a way that is in line with respondents’ common beliefs regarding attribute trade-offs.",Volume 41,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/41/suppl/C,15
"Authorities often lack information for efficient regulation of the commons. This paper derives a criterion comparing prices versus tradable quantities in terms of expected welfare, given uncertainty, optimal policy and endogenous cost structure. I show that one cannot determine which regulatory instrument that induces the highest expected welfare based on the relative curvatures of the cost and benefit functions alone. Furthermore, optimal policy involves different production (or price) targets across the regulatory instruments, and does not equalize marginal costs and expected marginal benefits under prices. The reason is that firms choose a cost structure which induces too large variance in consumption of the public good under prices, and the regulator has to compensate for this when determining optimal policy. Because no such negative externality arises under quantities, the relative performance of prices is deteriorated. A numerical illustration suggests significant impact. Finally, either regulatory instrument may induce the highest technology investment levels.",Volume 41,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/41/suppl/C,15
"We provide experimental evidence on behavior in a public goods game featuring a so-called point of no return, meaning that if the group's total contribution falls below this point all payoffs are reduced. Participants receive either common or private signals about the point of no return, and experience either high or low reductions in payoffs if insufficient contributions are made. Our data reveal that, as expected, contributions are higher if the cost of not reaching the threshold is high than if it is low. High signal values discourage contributions and endanger the likelihood of success when signals are common, but not when signals are private. In addition, successful coordination of contributions is less frequent in a control treatment featuring a standard provision point mechanism than in the experimental treatment where the payoff reduction factor is high, although the theoretical predictions of the two games are similar.",Volume 41,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/41/suppl/C,15
"Waste management and disposal are influenced by socio-economic, institutional and policy factors that possess idiosyncratic features in regional settings. The role of organized crime is a largely unexplored factor. Crime organizations such as the mafia are known to collude with local institutions to control waste markets. As a result, legal forms of waste disposal and socially preferable management options are often undermined primarily through an influence on policy enforcement. Given its high regional heterogeneity and local ‘waste crises’, Italy provides a compelling case for the study of crime's effects on local waste performance. Panel econometric analyses show that sorted collection of recyclable waste and legal forms of waste disposal are lower when the mafia's effect on the actions of local governments is more intense.",Volume 41,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/41/suppl/C,15
"Carbon offset markets are modeled as an uninformed regulator who wishes to use a voluntary price instrument to reduce harmful emissions under varying degrees of private information. Regulators offer agricultural producers payments to reduce their emissions for some price per ton relative to the social price of carbon. Abstracting from distributional concerns or costly transfers, we derive optimal contracts for offsets contracts, minimizing welfare losses from adverse selection. The model shows how the level of monitoring and the prices offered should vary depending on the regulator's information. Although existing and proposed policies discount the price that offset producers receive relative to the social cost of carbon to account for the adverse selection, our model argues that optimal offset prices may be above the social cost of carbon for sufficiently high levels of monitoring. Our model also identifies and quantifies the types of firms that produce additional offsets for a given contract, offering guidance on how regulators might better target offset contracts.",Volume 41,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/41/suppl/C,15
"We focus on the incentives of an industry with a continuum of small firms to invest in a cleaner technology under two environmental policy instruments: tradable emission permits and emission taxation. We assume asymmetric information, in that the firms’ abatement costs with the new technology are either high or low. Environmental policy is set either before the firms invest (commitment) or after (time consistency). Under commitment, the welfare comparison follows a modified Weitzman rule, featuring reverse probability weighting for the slope of the marginal abatement cost curve. Both instruments can lead to under- or overinvestment ex post. Tradable permits lead to less than optimal expected new technology adoption. Under time consistency, the regulator infers the cost realization and implements the full-information social optimum.",Volume 41,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/41/suppl/C,15
"Recent scientific advances have introduced the possibility of engineering the climate system to lower ambient temperatures without lowering greenhouse gas concentrations. This possibility has created an intense debate given the ethical, moral and scientific questions it raises. This paper examines the economic issues introduced when geoengineering becomes available in a standard model where strategic interaction leads to suboptimal mitigation. Geoengineering introduces the possibility of technical substitution away from mitigation, but it also affects the strategic interaction across countries: mitigation decisions directly affect geoengineering decisions. With similar countries, I find these strategic effects create greater incentives for free-riding on mitigation, but with asymmetric countries, the prospect of geoengineering can induce inefficiently high levels of mitigation.",Volume 41,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/41/suppl/C,15
"Harvest control rules and no-take marine reserves are two management approaches increasingly advocated as effective means of rebuilding depleted fish stocks and averting the collapse of fisheries. We incorporate the two approaches into a bioeconomic model and evaluate how they act as substitutes and/or complements when used together in fisheries stock recovery plans. Simulations of the model with estimated parameters from an actual fishery show that the cost of adopting a harvest strategy of slow stock rebuilding can be offset or substituted by a no-take reserve. For each of the harvest strategies explored, we find there is a range of reserve sizes that can act as a complement in a stock recovery plan such that a no-take reserve improves both the profitability of fishers and average annual harvest during stock rebuilding. We demonstrate that a stock recovery plan that incorporates both harvest control rules and no-take reserves can simultaneously contribute to conservation, economic and socio-economic objectives of fisheries management.",Volume 40,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/40/suppl/C,16
"Considering a differentiated mixed duopoly we show that when privatization and pollution tax are used together environmental damage will be non-monotone in the level of privatization, and optimal privatization is always partial privatization. Whether privatization will improve the environment or not depends on the public firm's concern for environment. If the public firm is unconcerned about environment, the socially optimal privatization will also damage the environment most. But when the public firm is concerned about environment, privatization will improve the environment. Generally, the relationship between optimal privatization and product substitutability is also non-monotone and inverted U-shaped.",Volume 40,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/40/suppl/C,16
"We propose a model to reconcile the theory of inter-temporal non-renewable resource depletion with well-known stylized facts concerning the exploitation of exhaustible resources such as oil. Our approach introduces geological constraints into a Hotelling type extraction–exploration model. We show that such constraints, in combination with initially small reserves and strictly convex exploration costs, can coherently explain bell-shaped peaks in natural resource extraction and hence U-shapes in prices. As production increases, marginal profits (marginal revenues less marginal extraction cost) are observed to decline, while as production decreases, marginal profits rise at a positive rate that is not necessarily the rate of discount.A numerical calibration to the global oil market predicts substantially higher future oil prices and considerably lower global oil production with the more realistic geological constraints set-up than with the Hotelling simulation. While mainly (small) non-OPEC producers increase production in response to higher oil prices induced by the geological constraints, most (large) producers’ production declines, leading to a lower peak level for global oil production. High future oil prices therefore, do not necessarily translate to increased oil supplies on global markets.",Volume 40,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/40/suppl/C,16
"This paper examines the relationship between resource development and industrialization. When transport costs are high, the region with a more valuable natural resource enjoys a higher welfare than the other region. However, as transport costs decrease, firms begin to move out of the region, causing the Dutch disease to occur, initially in terms of industry share, and eventually in terms of welfare too when transport is sufficiently free. A resource boom in intermediate inputs may strengthen the tendency for manufacturing agglomeration in the same region, but a resource boom in consumption inputs will weaken this tendency. The model thus provides insight for cities to utilize their limited resources efficiently.",Volume 40,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/40/suppl/C,16
"In a principal-agent model we analyze the firm's decision to adopt an informal or a standardized environmental management system (EMS). Our results are consistent with empirical evidence in several respects. A standardized EMS increases the internal control at the cost of introducing some degree of rigidity that entails an endogenous setup cost. Standardized systems are more prone to be adopted by big and well established firms and under tougher environmental policies. Firms with standardized EMS tend to devote more effort to abatement although this effort results in lower pollution only if public incentives are strong enough, suggesting a complementarity relationship between standardized EMS and public policies. Emission charges have both a marginal effect on abatement and a qualitative effect on the adoption decision that may induce a conflict between private and public interests. As a result of the combination of these two effects it can be optimal for the government to distort the tax in a specific way in order to push the firm to choose the socially optimal EMS. The introduction of standardized systems can result in win-win situations where firms, society and the environment get better off.",Volume 40,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/40/suppl/C,16
"National-level strategies for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD), financed by international transfers, have begun to emerge. A three-sector model is developed to explore the economy-wide effects of two policies implemented by a government participating in REDD that differ in how they bring together incentives and benefit sharing: an incentive payment scheme where these are intrinsically linked and taxes where they are separated. Two sectors utilise forest as an input to production, one in which forest is substitutable for labour, producing a carbon externality, and one in which forest and labour are complements and where forest is used sustainably. Two important effects determine model outcomes. First, the government factors in general equilibrium effects when determining the efficient payment level. This implies that the level of international transfers is not fully passed through to the forest-using sectors. Second, even though the sustainable sector receives no incentive payment it can increase in size through the effect of REDD payments on markets. With political influence, where incentives and benefit sharing are linked the forest-using sectors may lobby for lower payment rates for themselves in order to create a larger international transfer. Where there is a separation between incentives and benefit-sharing this effect disappears. The findings indicate that REDD may be less cost-effective than envisioned at the international level.",Volume 40,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/40/suppl/C,16
"We investigate the performance of a consumption-based carbon tax – implemented by full border carbon adjustment – as an instrument of unilateral climate damage mitigation in a two-period two-country general equilibrium model with a finite stock of fossil fuel. The implementation of that tax in the first period reduces the first-period emissions in the taxing and non-taxing country (negative within period leakage) if income effects are sufficiently weak. Otherwise, it increases the first-period emissions in both countries (green paradox). That result contrasts with the case of a unilateral production-based carbon tax, in which the leakage rate is always positive and possibly exceeds 100%.",Volume 40,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/40/suppl/C,16
"The Adirondack Park contains over 6 million acres and over 3000 lakes. Approximately 43% of the Park is publically owned and protected to remain “forever wild”. Despite regulatory measures aimed at protecting the natural resources of the Adirondacks, surface water quality is threatened by acid and mercury deposition. This paper uses data on 12,001 property transactions over 9 years in the 12 counties that comprise the Adirondack Park to explore how property owners value lake water quality using fixed effects hedonic analysis. We find that multiple measures of water quality have significant effects on property values including lake acidity, the presence of water milfoil, an invasive species, and the presence of loons, an indicator species. This research provides valuable insight into how water quality and associated ecosystem health are capitalized into property values. Moreover, this research helps partially quantify air pollution impacts on Adirondack property values and could be used to justify additional regulations to further restrict sulfur and mercury emissions which are negatively impacting the Park.",Volume 39,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/39/suppl/C,17
"We characterize an optimal hybrid policy for pollutant emissions that includes a permit price ceiling and emission cap in a multi-period model. Previous studies have primarily focused on a hybrid policy of emission regulation that included an emission cap and permit price ceiling in a single period model, we extend this literature by developing such an optimal hybrid model in a multi-period framework where banking and borrowing of emission permits is allowed. In our model, we compare the case of a regulator who sets the emission cap and price ceiling to be consistent with a long run emission objective with the case of a regulator who occasionally is motivated to deviate from the optimal long run regulatory policy in order to correct for unexpected but exceptionally high emissions. Using a discrete dynamic programming model with stochastic emissions, we show that the hybrid model gives the regulator a degree of freedom in making an optimal price and quantity choice.",Volume 39,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/39/suppl/C,17
The paper presents stylized cross-country evidence for a negative relationship between energy use and economic growth. Based on this motivation it develops a multisector framework to derive the growth impact of energy from first principles. The structural model is empirically estimated for a sample of 37 developed countries with five-year average data over the period 1975–2009. Estimations of both separate equations and simultaneous systems of equations are performed. The empirical results show a negative impact of energy use on investments in physical capital and knowledge formation. The estimations of simultaneous equations exhibit a dynamic effect of energy use: decreasing energy input and increasing energy prices induce additional investments fostering long-run growth. The growth effect counteracts the negative static effects of lower energy use.,Volume 39,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/39/suppl/C,17
"The paper provides a joint theoretical–empirical investigation to assess the adoption by manufacturing firms of innovations aimed at improving waste related performance. In line with the recent emphasis on the ‘external’ factors stimulating innovation, which often are more important than ‘traditional’ drivers such as R&D, we address the role of local policy environments and regional features. We analyse firms’ innovation adoption choices in a simplified technology adoption model, augmented to account for factors relevant to determining environmental innovation (EI). We frame our empirical analysis in an original integration of data from a firm level survey (Italian CIS2008 survey of manufacturing firms) and regional level waste related information. Our econometric analysis shows that firms adopt EI on the basis of some firm specific and relational factors, while usual drivers such as R&D have no impact. The evidence from our study supports the role of regional factors related to waste management and policy, that is, firms located in regions featuring better separated waste collection and stricter waste policy are more likely to adopt EI.",Volume 39,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/39/suppl/C,17
"We provide consistent, cross-country estimates of price and income elasticity for households in 11 OECD countries. Using survey data from 2011 on annual consumption of electricity and sample-derived average electricity price, we provide country-specific price elasticity estimates and average income elasticity estimates. For most countries in our sample, we find strong price responsiveness, with elasticities varying (in absolute value) between 0.27 for South Korea and 1.4 for Australia, and higher than 0.5 for most countries. Exploiting the presence of many attitudinal indicators in the dataset, we provide evidence that non-price related factors to affect energy demand; in particular, households' self-reported energy savings behaviour reduces demand between 2 and 4%. In contrast, we find very weak income responsiveness, with income elasticities varying from 0.07 to 0.16 and no evidence for heterogeneity across the countries in our sample. Our results regarding price elasticity are in contrast with those of many existing studies which find low-to-moderate price responsiveness, and adds to a few recent studies indicating more policy space for demand reduction than previously thought.",Volume 39,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/39/suppl/C,17
"While the compensatory model of choice dominates the environmental valuation literature, non-compensatory models, where individuals do not tradeoff one attribute for another, are sometimes found to be better representations of choice behavior. Most non-compensatory models employ “cutoffs”, the point at which utility abruptly changes. But cutoffs are usually elicited directly from respondents using a stated preference question. Such elicitation could be inaccurate and might introduce bias to the decision process. In this article, we develop a model that estimates cutoff levels endogenously. Our model has two error components, one for the utility function and another for the cutoff function. This facilitates the estimation of the cutoff as a function of individual specific variables. We estimate the model by maximizing the log-likelihood function that involves the weighted sum of the two error components. We test the model using synthetic data and find that estimated parameters are close to the true parameters. When applied to actual empirical data, our model appears to be a better fit than the compensatory preference model; however it is somewhat different than the self-reported cutoff model, highlighting the need for an approach that does not rely on stated cutoff information.",Volume 39,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/39/suppl/C,17
"Modern tools for cost-effective conservation reserve site planning require the planner to have information about spatial distributions of conservation costs and benefits. Climate change creates unprecedented uncertainty about future land values and species habitat ranges, such that conservation scientists cannot map costs and benefits with certainty anymore. This paper contributes to the literature on the economics of conservation in the face of climate change uncertainty. It advances a new method for using modern portfolio theory to choose lands to protect that yield total conservation returns with less uncertainty. It explores the implications for portfolio recommendations of variation in the correlations between ecological and land-value responses to climate change.

Controlling for a variety of individual and macro-level factors, we find that individuals’ SWB varies systematically and significantly with differences in the electricity mix across countries and across time.

"Sanitation and wastewater treatment are essential for protecting human health and environmental sustainability. Treatment processes are not free of environmental impacts; consequently assessment of the environmental performance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has gained interest in recent years.

The present study represents pioneering work to integrate environmental impacts in the assessment of the efficiency of WWTP estimating pure (PEPI) and mixed (MEPI) environmental performance indices for a sample of 60 Spanish WWTPs. Both direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were considered as undesirable outputs. The best functioning WWTPs to be used as references were identified, and the potential for GHG reductions was quantified.

"We present a model of lobbying by a polluting industry with private information on pollution abatement costs and compare taxes with quotas under such conditions. We also examine the effect of private information on lobbying activity and social welfare under these two instruments. It is found that private information might improve social welfare under taxes when the government has little concern for social welfare, whereas private information does not improve social welfare under quotas. Quotas are generally socially preferred when the slope of marginal abatement costs is steeper than that of marginal damage or when the government does not concern itself with social welfare. However, private information reduces the comparative disadvantage of taxes compared to quotas when the government has little concern for social welfare. Finally, the results of numerical examples suggest that quotas are employed rather than taxes if the difference in natural emission levels between high- and low-cost industries is large.",Volume 38,November 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/38/suppl/C,18
"This paper examines international cooperation on technological development as an alternative to international cooperation on GHG emission reductions. It is assumed that when countries cooperate they coordinate their investments so as to minimize the agreement costs of controlling emissions. Further it is assumed that in such cases they also pool their R&D efforts so as to fully internalize the spillover effects of their investments in R&D. In order to analyze the scope of cooperation, an agreement formation game is solved in three stages. First, countries decide whether or not to sign the agreement. Then, in the second stage, signatories (playing together) and non-signatories (playing individually) select their investment in R&D. Finally, in the third stage, each country decides on its level of emissions non-cooperatively. For linear environmental damages and quadratic investment costs, our findings show that the maximum participation in a R&D agreement consists of six countries and that participation decreases as spillover effects increase until a minimum participation consisting of three countries is reached.",Volume 38,November 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/38/suppl/C,18

The model consists of a two-stage game, where participants make an entry decision in the first stage and, if they choose to enter, decide how much resource to extract in the second stage. Results show that entry behavior and groundwater pumping decisions are significantly affected by the underlying spatial externalities of the resource. In instances where the impacts of groundwater use are spread across all resource users, we observe both a greater number of users choosing to use the resource and a higher intensity of use. The results support expectations from the model that groundwater management policies should focus on entry in addition to decisions related to the volume of pumping. The results also discern the interplay of entry with both hydrogeologic characteristics of the resource and the option to exit and reveal that the option to exit increases the intensity of extraction as well as initial entry rates.",Volume 38,November 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/38/suppl/C,18
"European power producers have a major influence on the EU ETS, given that both their CO2 emissions and their EUA (European Union Allowance) allocations account for more than half of the total volumes of the scheme. Fuel switching is often considered as the main short-term abatement measure under the EU ETS. It consists in substituting combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) for hard-coal plants in power generation. Thereby coal plants run for shorter periods, and CO2 emissions are reduced. This paper provides the first theoretical analysis of fuel switching, in a context where power plants involved are not equally efficient. We begin with a preliminary work using illustrative examples and sensitivity analyses, which enables us to observe how differences in the efficiency of power plants impact the cost of fuel switching, and how this is related to the level of switching effort. Based on this, we build a theoretical model taking into account the effect of differences in the efficiency of power plants involved in fuel switching. We also investigate the effect of the timing of fuel switching abatements, within the temporally defined environment of our dynamic model. Results demonstrate that the gas price and uncontrolled CO2 emissions act together on the carbon price. We show that the influence of the gas price on the carbon price depends on the level of uncontrolled CO2 emissions, due to heterogeneity of power plants that are used in the fuel switching process. Furthermore, we show that the time of occurrence of uncontrolled emissions matters so that shocks have a stronger impact when they occur in a period that is closed to the end of the phase.",Volume 38,November 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/38/suppl/C,18
"We identify a pollution-spillover effect in the relationship between emissions and income growth for a transboundary pollutant. This effect causes countries that are otherwise identical to follow very different emissions paths as they grow, due only to differences in the positions they occupy along the growth path. Emissions from a country of any given income depend on when it reaches that income level relative to other countries moving along the same income growth path. This variation across countries arises whenever the damage function is strictly convex in the level of global emissions. In such a setting, the emissions level for a country at any point in time depends on the level of emissions from all other countries at that time. This means that a country of given income will behave differently depending on whether other countries have high emissions (at the peak of their emissions paths) or low emissions (at the early or late stages of their emissions paths). The behavior of any individual country, at any point in time, therefore depends on its relative position in the global income distribution.",Volume 38,November 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/38/suppl/C,18
"The main objective of this paper is to test the temporal stability of stated preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) values from a Choice Experiment (CE) in a test–retest. The same group of participants was asked the same choice tasks in an internet-based CE, conducted twice with a time interval of one year without interviewer interference. We examine choice consistency at individual choice task level and transferability of the underlying indirect utility function and associated WTP values. The results show that choices are consistent in 57 percent of the choice occasions. Comparison of the choice models over time shows that the estimated preference and scale parameters are significantly different, suggesting that choice behaviour changed between the two surveys. Differences between marginal WTP estimates for individual choice attributes are statistically significant only at the 10 percent level. However, we show that this can result in significantly different WTP values for policy scenarios. The instability of estimated mean WTP values for different policy scenarios asks for caution when including WTP values in cost-benefit analysis.",Volume 38,November 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/38/suppl/C,18
"This paper provides a general framework for understanding consumer behavior related to goods and services that may be considered environmentally friendly, ethically produced, fairly traded, or some combination thereof. We generalize the impure public good model and derive its comparative static properties. The model accounts for any number of impure public (green) goods and joint production of any number of both private and public characteristics. The generalization provides a bridge between the impure public good model and the well-known linear characteristics model, both of which are special cases of the model developed here. The results show how demand for green goods and characteristics such as environmental quality depends on wealth, exogenously given levels of public goods, and the technologies of joint production. The effects of changes in technology depend critically on whether jointly produced characteristics are complements or substitutes in consumption. Several of the results are rather counterintuitive and differ in meaningful ways from existing models of impure public goods and linear characteristics. The results also illuminate several reasons for greater caution about whether it is reasonable to assume that green goods and services are necessarily beneficial for the provision of public goods.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"This paper analyzes the dynamic interaction between two regions with interconnected river basins. Precipitation is higher in one river-basin while water productivity is higher in the other. Water transfer increases productivity in the recipient basin, but may cause environmental damage in the donor basin. The recipient faces a trade-off between paying the price of the water transfer, or investing in alternative water supplies to achieve a higher usable water capacity. We analyze the design of this transfer using a dynamic modeling approach, which relies on non-cooperative game theory, and compare solutions with different information structures (Nash open-loop, Nash feedback, and Stackelberg) with the social optimum. We first assume that the equilibrium between supply and demand determines the optimal transfer price and amount. We show that, contrary to the static case, in a realistic dynamic setting in which the recipient uses a feedback information structure the social optimum will not emerge as the equilibrium solution. We then study different leadership situations in the water market and observe that the transfer amount decreases toward a long-run value lower than the transfer under perfect competition, which in turn lays below the social optimum. In consequence, the water in the donor's river-basin river converges to a better quality in the presence of market power. Finally, we numerically compare our results to the Tagus-Segura water transfer described in Ballestero (2004). Welfare gains are compared for the different scenarios. We show that in all dynamic settings, the long-run transfer amount is lower than in Ballestero's static model. Further, we show that the long-run price settles at a lower level than in Ballestero's model, but is still higher than the average cost-based price determined by the Spanish government.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"Hypothetical bias continues to be a major challenge for stated preference methods. Cheap Talk (CT) has been found to be an effective remedy in some applications, though empirical results are ambiguous. We discuss reasons why CT may fail to effectively remove specific types of hypothetical bias in Choice Experiments. We suggest augmenting CT in Choice Experiments with a so-called Opt-Out Reminder (OOR). Prior to each choice set, the OOR explicitly instructs respondents to choose the opt-out alternative, if they find the experimentally designed alternatives too expensive. In an empirical survey we find the OOR to significantly reduce total WTP and to some extent also marginal WTP beyond the capability of the CT applied without the OOR. This suggests that the CT practice should be adapted to fit the potentially different decision processes and repeated choices structure of the Choice Experiment format, rather than merely being adopted directly from Contingent Valuation.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"How are eco-label strategies affected by consumer confusion arising from the profusion of eco-labels? This article provides a theoretical insight into this issue using a double differentiation framework. We assume that consumers perceive a label as a sign of quality compared to an unlabeled product, but that they cannot fully assess the environmental quality associated with each label and only see each label as a particular variety of a similar product. We analyze the pricing strategies of three firms, each one providing one product: a labeled product, with high or medium environmental quality, according to the eco-label, or an unlabeled product. We infer lessons for eco-labeling policies, according to the identity of the certifying organization: the regulator, an NGO or the firms. We show that the firm supplying the eco-labeled product with a high environmental quality is weakened by consumer confusion while the firm selling the unlabeled product suffers from strict labeling standards, to the benefit of the firm providing the labeled product with a lower environmental quality, which gains a competitive advantage. Most labeling policies consist of harmonizing labeling criteria, but only certification by a third party, the regulator or a NGO, guarantees the high environmental quality of labeled products, whereas certification by firms leads to a uniform undemanding standard. However, when both labels are provided by two different certifiers, including a firm, harmonization of environmental standards does not occur and the NGO's or regulator's eco-labeling standard will be much more stringent than the firm's one, preventing NGO's or public eco-labeling policy to significantly enhance quality of the environment and welfare.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"When designing compensation payments for biodiversity conservation measures setting appropriate incentives so that landowners select spatially connected land parcels for conservation is of key importance for many species. The proposition of an agglomeration bonus, where landowners receive a homogeneous payment and a bonus on top if the spatial allocation of conserved land benefits biodiversity, has been widely discussed. Here, we compare for various ecological and economic parameters the cost-effectiveness and budget efficiency of an agglomeration bonus with a spatially homogeneous payment (where landowners receive the same payment regardless of the spatial allocation of conserved land) and an agglomeration payment (where landowners receive money only if conserved land parcels are spatially connected). Key results include that whether side payments between participants take place plays an important role in the relative performance of the payment options, and that the performance of the agglomeration bonus is either clearly dominated by one of the two other options, but never by both, or very close to the better performing option.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"The market structure for many mineral industries can be described as oligopoly with potential for Stackelberg leadership. This paper derives and analyzes dynamically consistent extraction equilibria in a two-period discrete-time “Truly” Stackelberg (TS) model of non-renewable resource extraction, where firms move sequentially within each period and where both the leader and follower have market power. We show how the leader may be able to manipulate extraction patterns by exploiting resource constraints. Whether the leader wants to speed up its own production relative to the Cournot–Nash (CN) equilibrium depends on the shape of its iso-profit curve, which is affected by the two firms’ relative stock endowments and relative production costs. If the leader extracts faster, then the follower extracts slower, but in aggregate the industry extracts faster. Unlike static Stackelberg games, the follower does not necessarily have a second mover disadvantage.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"We analyze oligopolistic exhaustible-resource depletion when firms can trade forward contracts on deliveries – a market structure relevant for some resource markets (e.g., storable pollution permits, hydro-based power pools) – and find that trading forwards can have substantial implications for resource depletion. We show that when firms’ initial resource-stocks are the same, the subgame-perfect equilibrium path approaches the perfectly competitive path as firms trade forwards frequently. But when the initial stocks differ, firms can credibly escape part of the competitive pressure of forward contracting. It is a unique feature of the resource model that equilibrium contracting and the degree of competition depends on resource endowments.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19

We use choice based data on Italian households’ current consumption expenditures from January 1999 to December 2006 merged with an air quality index. We consistently find that the income elasticity of willingness to pay for environmental quality is very close to one across income groups. Besides contributing to a strand of literature where there is scant empirical evidence, we provide the first attempt at implementing the theoretical approach suggested by Ebert (2007), which derives willingness to pay and its income elasticity using revealed preferences combined with household production.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"Many studies find that areas more dependent on natural resources grow more slowly – a relationship known as the resource curse. For counties in the south-central U.S., I find little evidence of an emerging curse from greater natural gas production in the 2000s. Each gas-related mining job created more than one nonmining job, indicating that counties did not become more dependent on mining as measured by employment. Increases in population largely mitigated a rise in earnings per job and crowding out. Furthermore, changes in the adult population by education level reveal that greater production did not lead to a less educated population.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"The recent trend toward decarbonization led to crucial challenges for network operators and regulators in terms of network reliability and optimal grid expansion. In order to analyze the effects of rising shares of renewable energy sources on investment decisions in both, the generation and the transmission sector, the following article brings together the two sectors in a single real options framework. This allows us to derive the optimal timing of the production capacity expansion and the optimal transmission price which assures its connection. We find that an increasing penetration through renewables leads to investment postponement in both sectors, which goes along with increased systematic risk. However, we show that the negative effects on the transmission firm can be overcome by choosing an appropriate incentive system.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"We consider an international emissions trading scheme with partial sectoral and regional coverage. Sectoral and regional expansion of the trading scheme is beneficial in aggregate, but not necessarily for individual countries. We simulate international CO2 emission quota markets using marginal abatement cost functions and the Copenhagen 2020 climate policy targets for selected countries that strategically allocate emissions in a bid to manipulate the quota price. Quota exporters and importers generally have conflicting interests about admitting more countries to the trading coalition, and our results indicate that some countries may lose substantially when the coalition expands in terms of new countries. For a given coalition, expanding sectoral coverage makes most countries better off, but some countries (notably the USA and Russia) may lose out due to loss of strategic advantages. In general, exporters tend to have stronger strategic power than importers.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"Monitoring is an important and costly activity in resource management problems such as containing invasive species, protecting endangered species, preventing soil erosion, and regulating contracts for environmental services. Recent studies have viewed optimal monitoring as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which provides a framework for sequential decision making under stochastic resource dynamics and uncertainty about the resource state. We present an overview of the POMDP framework and its applications to resource monitoring. We discuss the concept of the information content provided by monitoring systems and illustrate how information content affects optimal monitoring strategies. Finally, we demonstrate how the timing of monitoring in relation to resource treatment and transition can have substantial effects on optimal monitoring strategies.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"Global warming, alterations of ecosystems, and sunk investments all imply irreversible changes with uncertain future costs and benefits. The Arrow–Fisher–Hanemann–Henry quasi-option value and the Dixit–Pindyck option value both measure how irreversibility and uncertainty change the value of preserving an ecosystem or postponing an investment. This paper shows the precise relation between the two option values and explains that the quasi-option value captures the value of learning conditional on preservation, whereas the Dixit–Pindyck option value captures the net value of preservation under learning. We show how either of the two concepts alters the common net present value decision rule. We illustrate similarities, differences, and the decision rules in two instructive examples.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"This paper contributes to the literature on market power in emissions permits markets, modeling an emissions trading scheme in which polluters differ with respect to their marginal abatement costs at the business-as-usual emissions. The polluters play a two-stage static complete information game in which their market power arises endogenously from their characteristics. In the first stage all polluters bid in an auction for the distribution of the fixed supply of permits issued by the regulator, and in the second stage they trade these permits in a secondary market. For compliance, they can also engage in abatement activity at a quadratic cost. Under the assumptions of the model, in equilibrium all polluters are successful in the auction. In the secondary market the low-cost emitters are net sellers and the high-cost emitters are net buyers. Moreover, the high-cost emitters are worse off as a result of the strategic behavior. In addition, the secondary market price is unambiguously above the auction clearing price. I find that the aggregate compliance cost when polluters act strategically increases in the heterogeneity of their marginal abatement costs at the business-as-usual emissions, but there exists a threshold of the fixed supply of permits above which strategic behavior is compliance cost-saving for the polluters. Finally, for a low enough variance of the marginal abatement cost at the business-as-usual emissions, strategic behavior is compliance cost-saving for the polluters, regardless of the level of the available supply of permits.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"Costs of car ownership for company cars drivers and private car owners are very different. Car use, car choice decisions and preferences for car characteristics may therefore differ substantially between these two markets. In this paper, we present results of a study on the preferences of company car drivers for alternative fuel vehicles and their characteristics, based on data from an online stated choice experiment in the Netherlands. Results show that, assuming current car characteristics, preferences for alternative fuel vehicles, and for electric and fuel cell cars in particular, are substantially lower than those for the conventional technology. Limited driving ranges, long recharge/refuelling times and limited availability of refuelling opportunities, are to a large extent responsible for this. Preferences for alternative fuel vehicles increase considerably with improvements on these aspects, especially for the hybrid and flexifuel car. Under the current company car tax system in the Netherlands, which favours cleaner technologies, these two car types are even preferred to the conventional technology, assuming equal catalogue prices and personal monthly cost contributions. Comparing results with those from a similar choice experiment among private car owners shows that willingness to pay patterns for AFV improvements regarding driving range, recharge and refuelling times, fuel availability and diversity in AFV supply, are considerably different for company car drivers than for private car owners. Company and private car drivers may therefore react (very) differently to future improvements in AFV technology and fuel availability. We finally show that preferences of company car drivers for fuel cell and electric cars depend to a large extent on annual mileage. Market share simulations show that potential early adopters of electric and fuel cell cars can be found among people with a relatively low annual mileage.",Volume 37,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/37/suppl/C,19
"We present a model of endogenous growth in which the use of a non-renewable resource in production yields CO2 emissions whose accumulated stock negatively affects welfare. A CCS technology enables, via some effort, a partial reduction of these emissions.We characterize the social optimum and how the availability of CCS technology affects it, and study the trajectories of the decentralized economy. We then analyze economic policies. We first derive the expression of the Pigovian carbon tax and we give a full interpretation of its level, which is unique. We then study the impacts of three different second-best policies: a carbon tax, a subsidy to sequestered carbon, and a subsidy to labor in CCS.While all three tools foster CCS activity they generally have contrasting effects on resource extraction, carbon emissions, output and consumption. The carbon tax postpones resource extraction whereas the two subsidies accelerate it. Although the tax decreases short-term carbon emissions, the two subsidies can increase them, thus yielding a green paradox. The tax has a negative impact on the levels of output and consumption in the short-term, unlike the subsidies. The tax generally fosters growth whereas the subsidies reduce it; however, when the weight of the CCS sector in the economy is high, these impacts can be reversed.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20
"Renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) have become a popular tool for state governments to promote renewable electricity generation and to decrease carbon dioxide emissions within a state or region. Renewable portfolio standards are a policy tool likely to persist for many decades due to the long term goals of many state RPSs and the likely creation of a federal RPS alongside any comprehensive climate change bill. Even though RPSs have become a popular policy tool, there is little empirical evidence about their costs. Using the temporal and regional variation in RPS requirements, I estimate the long-run price elasticity of supply of renewable electricity generation to be 2.67 (95% CI of 1.74, 3.60). Using my preferred elasticity estimate, I calculate the marginal cost of abatement from RPSs is at least $11 per ton of CO2 compared to a marginal cost of abatement of $3 per ton in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20
"We bridge the non-market microeconomic recreational demand and bioeconomic modeling literatures by constructing a dynamic model to guide optimal management of recreational fisheries. Our model incorporates multiple forms of angler heterogeneity and directly models feedbacks between policy instruments and angler behavior rather than dictating behavior as a social planner. This approach highlights the importance of distinct forms of heterogeneity for price and technology based management. We show that management with a price instrument charged per unit fish mortality or a differentiated charge per trip, an input to fish mortality, fully internalizes the dynamic stock externality when the manager observes agent heterogeneity in stock impacts, but is naïve to heterogeneity in preferences. Unobserved heterogeneity in stock impacts leads to welfare loss that increases with the variance of unobserved stock impacts. When the manager uses technology constraints to manage the fishery, understanding heterogeneity in preference, price, and stock impacts leads to greater social welfare, and understanding all sources of heterogeneity is necessary to optimally manage the resource. Nevertheless, technology based management can never replicate the first best. Explicit incorporation of heterogeneity and behavior enables us to show exactly where welfare is lost.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20
"Energy and environmental regulations often result in by-products that can reduce compliance costs. This research evaluates a unique case in which the marketability of gypsum by-product produced from sulfur dioxide (SO2) scrubbing operations at coal-fired electric plants has a theoretically ambiguous impact on pollution emissions. Intuitively, the ability to market flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum provides incentives for electricity generating plants to operate their scrubbers more efficiently by providing gypsum revenues, and lowering gypsum disposal costs. Gypsum marketability also creates incentives for plants to burn coal with higher sulfur content in order to increase their gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) production. The overall impact of FGD gypsum marketability on boiler-level SO2 emissions is therefore the empirical question of interest. Electricity boiler-level fixed-effect estimations suggest annual SO2 emissions decline by 3494 tons (39%) as a result of gypsum marketing. An upper bound on the total external benefits associated with the reduced SO2 emissions is estimated at $350.6 billion (2011$), or roughly 2.1% of the total benefits of the U.S. Clean Air Act (CAA) from 1990 to 2010.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20
"The bulk of the literature investigating persistence properties of non-renewable resource prices series has focused on application of unit root tests. This paper contributes to the debate, applying a methodology which allows (1) robust detection of the presence and (if so) the number of changes, (2) inference on stationarity of the series, and (3) estimation of change locations. In contrast to previous papers, the analysis is carried out from the perspective of stationarity testing, incorporating quadratic trends and the possibility of smooth changes. For a classical database, we find significant evidence of trend stationarity in most of the series, suggesting that shocks are mostly of a transitory nature. Exceptions are silver and natural gas, with stationarity being rejected for all the specifications considered in the paper. Finally, the knowledge of the stochastic characteristics of the series allows robust detection of change points which appear to be related to economic events.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20
"This paper develops an optimal harvesting model for the wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), where various age classes of the population are included. It is shown that the marginal value–fecundity relationship of the spawning population, comprising young and old fish, is crucial for the optimal fishing composition. If the value–fecundity ratio is higher for the old spawning population, this age-class should be harvested more aggressively than the young spawning population, and vice versa. It is also shown that changes in prices and interest rate have similar as well as different effects than in the standard fishing biomass model. Small changes in the relative price for the harvestable age classes could either increase or reduce the optimal harvest intensity, or have no effect. While a higher interest rate tends to increase fishing, there also exist intervals of the interest rate in which the optimal harvest program is not affected by changes in the interest rate.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20
"For carbon-intensive, internationally-traded industrial goods, a unilateral increase in the domestic CO2 price may result in the reduction of the domestic production but an increase of imports. In such sectors as electricity, cement and steel, the trade flows result more from short-term regional disequilibria between supply and demand than from international competition. This paper formalizes this empirical observation and characterizes its impact on carbon leakage. Domestic firms invest in domestic plants under uncertain domestic demand conditions; then, as uncertainty unfolds, they may supply the domestic market from their domestic plants or from imports. We prove that there would be no leakage in the short term (without capacity adjustment) but that there would be in the long term (with capacity adjustment). Furthermore the larger the uncertainty, the larger the leakage. We also characterize the impact of uncertainty on the (short and long term) pass-through rates of the carbon price. In the concluding section we discuss the implications of these results for the evaluation of climate policies.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20
"We analyze a dynamic game between a buyer and a seller of a nonrenewable resource. The seller chooses resource supply; the buyer can pay a fixed cost to invent a perfect substitute for the resource at any time. In closed-loop equilibrium, the buyer adopts the substitute when the resource is exhausted. Investing makes the buyer worse off because it decreases resource supply, destroys his ability to derive surplus from the resource through delaying the investment cost incurrence, and causes a larger share of the resource stock to be sold at his reservation price. From the seller's perspective, the buyer's ability to develop a substitute is equivalent to an already available substitute with a higher marginal cost.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20

While small countries refrain from subsidizing green energy and thus implement the efficient allocation, large permit-importing countries may subsidize green energy in order to influence the permit price in their favor.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20
"Environmentally-friendly (“green”) products face a unique set of market barriers. I develop a dynamic model of observational learning and costly search wherein a green consumer product enters a market to challenge an established “dirty” product. Purchase decisions depend on price and quality differences, consumers’ willingness-to-pay to protect the environment, and the cost of obtaining information. Using both theoretical analyses and simulations, I solve for the long-term market performance of the green product. Conditions are provided for when it is socially optimal to encourage green purchases with public policy. Comparative statics predict the effectiveness of various policy tools used to improve market performance. Permanent financial incentives are shown to be more effective than informational campaigns at encouraging green purchases if the green product is inferior to the dirty substitute. Temporary financial incentives are shown to be an ineffective tool to encourage the long-term market success of any green product. Numerical market simulations are used to test and supplement the theory.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20
"Improving information about individual opportunity costs of deforestation agents has the potential to increase the efficiency of REDD when it takes the form of a payment for environmental services scheme. However, objectives pursued in REDD projects may vary across policy makers. Within a theoretical framework, this paper explores the impacts of different policy objectives under two opportunity cost settings: asymmetric and full information. For a policy maker aiming to maximize net income from REDD, having full information may not increase the amount of forest conserved but could lead to a redistribution of rents away from agents. By contrast, for an environmental policy maker focused on maximizing the amount of forest conserved under REDD having full information increases the amount of forest conserved while reducing the rents received by agents. For a policy maker pursuing poverty alleviation objectives in REDD-affected communities, having full information makes no difference to overall welfare as rents remain with agents. The amount of deforestation avoided will at least be as high as under asymmetric information. These results are illustrated with data collected on opportunity costs in Amazonas State, Brazil.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20
"We take a capital asset pricing approach to the determination of the price of a nonrenewable natural resource in the case where the resource is durable, in the sense that once extracted it becomes a productive asset held above ground. The portfolio choice is then made up of the following assets: a stock of nonrenewable resource held in the ground that yields no dividend, a stock of resources held above ground that yields a dividend in the form of a flow of productive services, and a stock of composite good that can be held either in the form of productive capital or of a bond whose return is given. There is a stochastic element to the rate of change of productivity in both the production of the composite good and in the extraction of the resource. It is shown that the resulting prediction for the price path of the resource differs considerably from the one that follows from the elementary Hotelling model and that no unambiguous prediction can be drawn analytically about the pattern of behavior of that price path.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20
"We examine the efficiency and distributional impacts of greenhouse gas policies directed toward the electricity sector in a model that links a “top-down” general equilibrium representation of the U.S. economy with a “bottom-up” electricity-sector dispatch and capacity expansion model. Our modeling framework features a high spatial and temporal resolution of electricity supply and demand, including renewable energy resources and generating technologies, while representing CO2 abatement options in non-electric sectors as well as economy-wide interactions. We find that clean and renewable energy standards entail substantial efficiency costs compared to a carbon pricing policy such as a cap-and-trade program or a carbon tax, and that these policies are regressive across the income distribution. The geographical distribution of cost is characterized by high burdens for regions that depend on non-qualifying generation fuels, primarily coal. Regions with abundant hydro power and wind resources, and a relatively clean generation mix in the absence of policy, are among the least impacted. An important shortcoming of energy standards vis-à-vis a carbon pricing policy is that no revenue is generated that can be used to alter unintended distributional consequences.","Volume 36, Issue 2",May 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/2,20

"Within a non-cooperative transboundary pollution game, we investigate the impact of the adoption of a cleaner technology (i.e., a decrease in the emission to output ratio). We show that countries may respond by increasing their emissions resulting in an increase in the stock of pollution that may be detrimental to welfare. It is when the damage and/or the initial stock of pollution are relatively large and when the natural rate of decay of pollution is relatively small that this rebound effect of clean technologies is strongest. Moreover, these results are shown to arise for a significant and empirically relevant range of parameters for the case of greenhouse gas emissions.

"Among the ethical objections to intergenerational impartiality is the violation of consumer sovereignty given that individuals are impatient. We accommodate that concern by distinguishing intra- and inter-generational discounting in an OLG model suitable for analyzing sustainability issues. Under the assumption of constant elasticity of marginal felicity, the optimum trajectory of aggregate consumption is guided, via the Ramsey condition, by the intergenerational discount rate but not the personal discount rate. In an economy with produced capital and a renewable resource, intergenerational neutrality results in a sustained growth path, without the necessity of a sustainability constraint, even in the presence of intragenerational impatience.

"One country or sector that tries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may fear that other countries or sectors will get a competitive advantage and increase emissions. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models such as Elliott et al. (2010a, 2010b) indicate that 15–25% of abatement might be offset by this “leakage.” Yet the Fullerton et al. (2012) simple two-sector analytical general equilibrium model shows an offsetting term with negative leakage. In this paper, we use a full CGE model with many countries and many goods to measure effects in a way that allows for this negative leakage term. We vary elasticities of substitution and confirm the analytical model's prediction that whether this negative leakage term offsets the positive leakage terms depends on the ability of consumers to substitute into the untaxed good relative to the ability of firms to substitute from carbon emissions into labor or capital.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"The expansion of wind-generation in the United States poses significant challenges to policy-makers, particularly because wind's intermittency and unpredictability can exacerbate problems of congestion on a transmission-constrained grid. Understanding these issues is necessary if optimal development of wind energy and transmission is to occur. This paper applies a model that integrates the special concerns of electricity generation to empirically consider the challenges of developing wind resources in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Given the lack the high frequency data needed to address the special problems of intermittency and congestion, our solution is to create a dispatch model of the region and to use simulations to generate the necessary data, then use this data to understand patterns that have occurred as wind resources have been developed.Our results indicate that the price effects caused by changes in power output at intermittent sources are strongly dependent on supply conditions and the presence of market distortions caused by transmission constraints. Peculiarities inherent in electric grid operation can cause system responses that are not always intuitive. The distribution of the rents accruing to wind generation, particularly in unexpectedly windy periods are strongly dependent on the allocation of transmission rights when congestion occurs, which impacts potential returns to developing wind resources. Incidents of congestion depend on the pace of development of wind and transmission capacity. Not accounting for such distortions may cause new investment to worsen market outcomes if mistaken estimates of benefits or costs lead to sub-optimal development of wind and transmission facilities.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"As the importance of addressing climate change increases the future global role for nuclear power, the demand for uranium will increase. Expanded uranium reserves will be needed to meet this increased demand, highlighting the importance of future exploratory efforts. To shed light on the social desirability of future exploration levels I analyze a past expansionary period in the U.S. uranium industry. I find exploration levels were smaller than socially efficient during this period, resulting from a deviation between the private and social values of information. Looking forward, public policies can encourage optimal exploration levels by addressing this deviation.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"The federal government now confronts considerable political pressure to add CO2 to the existing set of criteria air pollutants. As with current criteria pollutants, proposals call for control of CO2, assuming that the control of each of the three criteria pollutants is separable from the others. However, control of CO2, SO2, and NOX emissions is most appropriately viewed as joint rather than separable based on engineering relationships. Empirically, we also find considerable jointness. Using a 10-year panel for 77 U.S. electric utilities, which comprise the largest sector in terms of energy-related CO2 emissions, we estimate a multiple-input, multiple-output directional distance function combining good inputs (production capital, pollution control capital, labor, and energy) and a bad input (sulfur burned) to produce good outputs (residential and industrial/commercial electricity production) and bad outputs (SO2, NOX, and CO2). We find that while utilities do not directly control CO2 emissions, considerable jointness exists across SO2, NOX, and CO2 emissions. Failure to account for this jointness increases the cost of pollution control, making it less acceptable to the public and policymakers. We also compute the technical efficiency of our set of utilities and find that considerable cost savings can be achieved by adopting the best technology for production of electricity and reduction of pollutants.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"We provide new cost estimates for carbon sequestration through afforestation in the U.S. We extend existing studies of carbon sequestration costs in several important ways, while ensuring the transparency of our approach. Our costs estimates have five distinguishing features: (1) we estimate costs for each county in the contiguous U.S., (2) we include afforestation of rangeland, in addition to cropland and pasture, (3) our opportunity cost estimates account for capitalized returns to future development (including associated option values) in addition to returns to agricultural production, (4) we develop a new set of forest establishment costs for each county, and (5) we incorporate data on Holdridge life zones to limit afforestation in locations where temperature and moisture availability prohibit forest growth. We find that at a carbon price of $50/ton, approximately 200 million tons of carbon would be sequestered annually through afforestation. At a price of $100/ton, an additional 100 million tons of carbon would be sequestered each year. Our estimates closely match those in earlier econometric studies for relatively low carbon prices, but diverge at higher carbon prices. Our results indicate a smaller, but still important, role for forest-based carbon sequestration in offsetting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"Jointly with kilowatt-hours (kWh), electric power plants also produce CO2, NOx, and SO2. In this paper, we apply an environmental production model based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) to compare the production of kWh under command-and-control regulation of the undesirable byproduct with tradable permit regulation of the byproduct. This is done for each of the three undesirable outputs and combinations of them. We apply our model to a dataset of 80 coal-fired electric power plants from 1995 to 2005. From this we can identify the potential gains from trading the most common undesirable outputs produced by coal-fired electric power plants.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"A clean energy standard (CES) is a flexible approach to encouraging a cleaner technology mix for electricity production. The most recent federal CES proposal from former Senator Bingaman would transform the way electricity is produced and result in substantial reductions in CO2 emissions with small national average electricity price effects through 2025. After 2025, electricity prices would increase substantially. The alternative compliance payment (ACP) for clean energy credits will be binding, so actual deployment of clean energy will fall short of the intended targets, and cumulative emissions reductions by 2035 will be 12 percent smaller than they would be without an ACP. The small utility exemption from the CES requirements equates to roughly $29 billion in avoided electricity expenditures by the customers of exempted utilities in 2035 alone. Excluding power generated by existing nuclear and hydroelectric facilities from CES compliance responsibility raises electricity prices in competitive regions to the benefit of owners of existing nuclear and hydroelectric capacity.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"One proposed climate policy is a “power-sector-only” approach that would focus exclusively on controlling carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation. This paper uses an intertemporal computable general equilibrium model of the world economy called G-Cubed to compare a power-sector-only climate policy with two alternative economy-wide measures that either: (1) place the same price on carbon or (2) achieve the same cumulative emissions reduction as the program limited to the power sector. We find that the power-sector-only approach requires a carbon price to electric utilities that is almost twice the economy-wide carbon price that would achieve the same cumulative emissions. In addition, we find that the power-sector-only policy does not produce offsetting increases in emissions in other sectors or other countries. Rather, we find that domestic carbon emissions outside the power sector fall slightly relative to baseline as higher electricity prices slow overall economic activity. Global emissions leakage is negligible as the price of oil in other currencies changes little. All three policies reduce investment in the capital-intensive energy sector, which lowers imports of durable goods and strengthens the U.S. terms of trade.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"We explore the optimal time path of carbon sequestration and carbon abatement in stabilizing CO2 levels under uncertainty of climate impacts. Using a two-period sequential decision making model, we analytically derive optimal rates for the two control variables, abatement and sequestration rates. Uncertainty is assumed to affect the desired future stabilization level of the CO2 stock but is resolved prior to the decision on how much to control the stock in the second period. Contrary to recent numerical studies, we find that uncertainty can make it optimal to use carbon sequestration either earlier or later depending on the relative rates of change in both marginal cost curves and on the amount of land that can be converted to forest. Comparative statics suggest that an increase in the discount factor could either increase or decrease the optimal rate of sequestration in the first period depending on the expected rate of change of the marginal cost of sequestration in the second period and on future benefits of current sequestration.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"Bio-energy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) has the potential to be a key mitigation option, because it can generate electricity and absorb emissions at the same time. However, biomass is not distributed evenly across the globe and regions with a potentially high demand might be constrained by limited domestic supply. Therefore, climate mitigation policies might create the incentive to trade biomass internationally. This paper uses scenarios generated by the integrated assessment model WITCH to study trade of woody biomass from multiple perspectives: the volume of biomass traded, its value, the impact on other power generation technologies and on the efficiency of mitigation policy. The policy scenarios consist of three representative carbon tax policies (4.8 W/m2, 3.8 W/m2 and 3.2 W/m2 radiative forcing values in 2100) and a cap-and-trade scheme (3.8 W/m2 in 2100). Results show that the incentive to trade biomass is high: at least 50% of biomass consumed globally is traded internationally. Regions trade 13–69 EJ/yr of woody biomass in 2050 and 55–81 EJ/yr in 2100. In 2100 the value of biomass traded is equal to US$ 0.7–7.2 Trillion. Trade of woody biomass substantially increases the efficiency of the mitigation policy. In the tax scenarios, abatement increases by 120–323 Gt CO2 over the century. In the cap-and-trade scenario biomass trade reduces the price of emission allowances by 34% in 2100 and cumulative discounted policy costs by 14%.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"The consequences of environmental and energy policies in the U.S. can be severely constrained by physical limits of the electric power grid. Flows do not follow the shortest path but are distributed over all lines in accordance with the laws of physics, so grid operators must select which generation units to operate at each moment, not only to minimize production costs, but also to prevent the system from collapsing because of line overloads. Because of the complexity of power grid operation, computing limitations have until very recently made it impossible to solve a policy analysis or planning model that combines realistic modeling of flows with a detailed transmission system model and the prediction of generator investment and retirement. We construct and solve a model of the eastern US and Canada that combines these characteristics. Then, because a smaller model would be usable for some additional purposes, we explore the effects of transmission model simplification on the accuracy of simulation results. To evaluate the amount of detail necessary, we simulate the short- and long-term effects of imposing a price on the carbon dioxide emissions from the power plants in nine northeastern US states, as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative does. We consider three grid models that simplify the actual 62,000-node system to varying degrees. Our 5000-node model matches the 62,000-node model very closely. We use it as the basis for evaluating the more simplified models: a 300-node model and a model with just one node, i.e. no transmission constraints. With each of the three models, we predict the carbon dioxide emission impacts, electricity price impacts, and generator entry and exit impacts of the emission price, over the next 20 years. We find that most of the impact predictions produced by the 300- and one-node models differ from those of the 5000-node model by more than 20%, and some by much more. Fortunately, the 5000-node model, and others with its combination of transmission detail, realistic flows, entry prediction, and retirement prediction can be used for many useful purposes.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"This paper investigates the intertemporal monopolistic supply of a clean technology and addresses the following questions: How does the lack of governments to commit restrict the incentives and thereby the supply of clean technologies? Are either emission taxes or emission permits better suited in such a dynamic setting? Although the monopoly can be forced to price taking behaviour, the inability of governments to commit leads to too slow and to too little expansion. Prices and quantities are equivalent for different kinds of government's objectives. An (important) exception is the case of non-competitive supply of the dirty input: taxes dominate from a welfare perspective however due to the additional scope to accrue rents and not due to an improvement of incentives for the development of clean technologies. Permits eliminate pollution entirely, which fosters the expansion of the clean technology.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"Bio-invasions occur in management mosaics where local control affects spread and damage across political boundaries. We address two obstacles to local implementation of optimal regional control of a bio-invasion that damages public and private resources across jurisdictions: lack of local funds to protect the public resource and lack of access to protect the private resource. To evaluate these obstacles, we develop a spatial-dynamic model of the optimal control of emerald ash borer (EAB) in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota, USA. We focus on managing valuable host trees with preventative insecticide treatment or pre-emptive removal to slow EAB spread. The model includes spatial variation in the ownership and benefits of host trees, the costs of management, and the budgets of municipal jurisdictions. We develop and evaluate centralized strategies for 17 jurisdictions surrounding the infestation. The central planner determines the quantities of trees in public ownership to treat and remove over time, to maximize benefits of surviving trees net costs of management across public and private ownerships, subject to constraints on municipal budgets, management activities, and access to private trees. The results suggest that centralizing the budget across jurisdictions rather than increasing any one municipal budget does more to increase total net benefits. Strategies with insecticide treatment are superior to ones with pre-emptive removal because they reduce the quantity of susceptible trees at lower cost and protect the benefits of healthy trees. Increasing the accessibility of private trees to public management substantially slows EAB spread and improves total net benefit.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"There are two major ways in which solid waste can be sorted and recycled – at the household level, when households are required to sort waste into a given number of categories, or in specialised sorting facilities. Traditionally, it has been thought that sorting at the household level is an inconvenience, as it uses space and requires time and effort. Our study provides empirical evidence to the contrary, indicating that home sorting is a net source of utility for some people. Through a carefully designed choice experiment we collected stated choices from members of a Polish municipality with respect to the way their waste is sorted and how often it is collected. In the hypothetical scenario employed, respondents were informed that waste will be sorted anyway – if not at the household level then at a specialised sorting facility. Interestingly, analysis shows that a large group of people are willing to sort waste at the household level even if unsorted waste would be collected at no extra cost. For a minority, increased home sorting of waste would, however, impose a loss of utility. Overall, our results indicate that most respondents preferred to sort waste themselves if given the choice. We provide a few possible explanations of this perhaps surprising result, including the desire to promote a green external image, and a concern about the effectiveness of separation activities performed by others.","Volume 36, Issue 1",January 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/36/issue/1,21
"We model a market with environmentally conscious consumers and a duopoly in which firms consider the adoption of a clean technology. We show that as pollution increases, consumers shift more resources to the environmental activities, thereby affecting negatively the demand faced by the duopoly. This effect generates incentives for firms to adopt the clean technology even in the absence of emissions taxes. When such taxes are considered, our results indicate that the benefit of adopting the clean technology is initially increasing and then decreasing in the emission tax. The range of values for which the emission tax increases this benefit becomes narrower when the consumers’ environmental awareness is stronger.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 451-678 (November 2013)",November 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/4,22
"R&D is an uncertain activity with highly skewed outcomes. Nonetheless, most recent empirical studies and modeling estimates of the potential of technological change focus on the average returns to research and development (R&D) for a composite technology and contain little or no information about the distribution of returns to R&D – which could be important for capturing the range of costs associated with climate change mitigation policies – by individual technologies. Through an empirical study of patent citation data, this paper adds to the literature on the outcomes of energy R&D by focusing on the behavior of the most successful innovations for six energy technologies, allowing us to determine whether uncertainty or differences in technologies matter most for success. We highlight two key results. First, we compare the results from an aggregate analysis of six energy technologies to technology-by-technology results. Our results show that existing work that assumes diminishing returns but assumes one generic technology is too simplistic and misses important differences between more successful and less successful technologies. Second, we use quantile regression techniques to learn more about patents that have a high positive error term in our regressions – that is, patents that receive many more citations than predicted based on observable characteristics. We find that differences across technologies, rather than differences across quantiles within technologies, are more important. The value of successful technologies persists longer than those of less successful technologies, providing evidence that success is the culmination of several advances building upon one another, rather than resulting from one single breakthrough. Diminishing returns to research activities appear most problematic during rapid increases of research investment, such as experienced by solar energy in the 1970s.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 451-678 (November 2013)",November 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/4,22
"By using a unique cross-sectional dataset of Chinese industrial firms, this paper investigates the external and internal effects of human capital on firms’ environmental performance. The result shows that firms have better environmental compliance because they are ‘pushed’ into compliance by the internal driver of human capital and ‘pulled’ to be environmental friendly by the external force of social human capital stock. This finding is robust when we take into account the possible endogeneity of human capital. In addition, evidence from this study suggests that the current situation of weak implementation of environmental supervision and evasion of environmental monitoring could be improved by promotion of internal and external human capital.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 451-678 (November 2013)",November 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/4,22
"When there is a larger scope for replacing non-renewable resource use by renewable resources, resource depletion can be more easily avoided. However institutional failures may prevent this advantage to materialize. We offer a unified framework showing how this insight applies to the following highly different situations analyzed in six different papers. First, a more parsimonious use of Antibiotics may reduce the decay of antibiotic efficacy. Second, biofuels introduced in energy supply allow for reduced energy prices and fossil depletion. Third, when a larger fraction of carbon decays, a larger part of fossil reserves can be exploited. Fourth, limiting disruption of the climate enhances carbon decay. Fifth, expropriation of harvest slows down depletion, while free access to a resource accelerates it. Sixth, forest cover depletion is slowed down when trees grow faster.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 451-678 (November 2013)",November 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/4,22

"We study the effects on the food price of introducing biofuels as a substitute for fossil fuel in the energy market. Energy is supplied by a price-leading oil cartel and a competitive fringe of farmers producing biofuel. Biofuel production shares a finite land resource with food production. A positive relationship results between energy and food prices. We establish that the equilibrium price of food will be growing as long as the oil stock is being depleted, and beyond if demand is growing. An analysis of the effects of the productivity of land use in either the food or the biofuel sectors is carried out. It is shown that, with a highly inelastic demand for food, an increase in the productivity of land in agriculture will decrease the price of food in the short-run, only to increase it in the long-run as the stock of fossil fuel is depleted.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 451-678 (November 2013)",November 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/4,22
"We study a dynamic carbon pollution model where carbon accumulates both inside a nonrenewable and a renewable reservoir with a constant regeneration rate. Two primary energy sources are available: a cheap exhaustible fossil fuel (coal) and an expensive clean energy alternative (solar). To avoid catastrophic climate events, the global carbon concentration has to remain below some critical mandated ceiling. We show that there exists an upper bound on the coal endowment that can be consumed, which distinguishes two main cases: coal is initially abundant or scarce. If the energy sector has to provide a constant aggregate energy flow to the final users, cost-effectiveness requires that the global ceiling should be attained only when solar energy is introduced. Then the economy stays forever at the ceiling and coal use is progressively replaced by solar energy use. In the abundant coal case, this energy sources substitution process lasts for an infinite duration while in the scarce coal case, coal exploitation ends in finite time. Under a welfare maximization criterion, if coal is abundant, we show that the economy may follow a sequence of phases at the ceiling and below the ceiling before the final transition towards clean energy.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 451-678 (November 2013)",November 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/4,22
"This paper extends the classical exhaustible-resource/stock-pollution model with irreversibility of pollution decay, meaning that after reaching some threshold there is no decay of the pollution stock. Within this framework, we answer the question how the potential irreversibility of pollution affects the extraction path. We investigate the conditions under which the economy will optimally adopt a reversible policy, and when it is optimal to enter the irreversible region. In the case of irreversibility it may be optimal to leave a positive amount of resource in the ground forever. As far as the optimal extraction/emission policy is concerned, several types of solutions may arise, including solutions where the economy stays at the threshold for a while. Given that different programs may satisfy the first order conditions for optimality, we further investigate when each of these is optimal. We show that it is never optimal for the economy to stay at the threshold for a while before entering the irreversible region. The optimality analysis is then illustrated by means of a calibrated example. To sum up, for any pollution level, we can identify a critical resource stock such that there exist multiple optima i.e. a reversible and an irreversible policy that yield exactly the same present value. For any resource stock below this critical value, the optimal policy is reversible whereas with large enough resources, irreversible policies outperform reversible programs.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 451-678 (November 2013)",November 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/4,22
"In the natural-resource literature, conventional wisdom holds that weak property rights will cause a resource to be over-exploited. This is because weak property rights are typically perceived as a problem of input exclusion – or theft of un-extracted resources. We present evidence to the effect that weak property rights often take the form of contestable outputs – or output theft – and that this has an impact on resource use. We propose a model of resource use under generally weak property rights – or weak state presence – when resource users face the dual problem of input exclusion and output appropriation. We show that introducing the possibility that outputs be contested acts as an output tax, with the added twist that resource users effectively determine the tax level. This tax has a depressive effect on input use. Whether the resource is under- or over-exploited depends on the relative severity of output appropriation and input exclusion problems. Increasing enforcement measures against theft may lead to severe resource overuse. Efficiency considerations require to account not only for direct resource input use, but also for thieves’ efforts and gains as well as the costs of enforcement against theft and trespass.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 451-678 (November 2013)",November 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/4,22
"In the literature of comprehensive national accounts, national net investments are used to indicate dynamic welfare improvement in an economy. A well-known approach associates national net investments with the shadow value of change in stock of capital assets in an economy. Following this capital stock approach, sectoral net investments can be defined as the shadow value of change in stock of capital assets owned by a sector in an economy. An alternative approach is based on future commodity flows to a sector. This commodity flow approach associates sectoral net investments with the present value of changes in future commodity flows to a sector. In the present paper, I compare these two approaches and prove that they coincide with each other only if the future commodity flows to the sector can be attributed to current stock of capital assets in the sector alone. In empirical studies, commodity flow approach can be a better alternative if the purpose is to estimate the contributions to national net investments of a recipient of future cash flows.","Volume 35, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/3,23

However, behavioral economic research indicates that the origin of a resource may affect the use of that resource.

Results indicate that resource origin does not significantly influence aggregate appropriation levels but that endogenous resource provision leads to individual strategic behavior.","Volume 35, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/3,23

This paper extends the link between the utilitarian criterion and the maximin for the cases with finite elasticity of marginal utility.

"Policymakers often rely on non-pecuniary, information-based programs to achieve social objectives. Using data from a water conservation information campaign implemented as a randomized controlled trial, we estimate heterogeneous household responses. Understanding such heterogeneity is important for improving the cost-effectiveness of non-pecuniary programs, extending them to other populations and probing the mechanisms through which the treatment effects arise. We find little evidence of heterogeneous responses to purely technical information or to traditional conservation messages that combine technical information and moral suasion. In contrast, norm-based messages that combine technical information, moral suasion and social comparisons exhibit strong heterogeneity: households that are wealthier, owner-occupied and use more water are more responsive. These subgroups tend to be least responsive to pecuniary incentives. We find no evidence that any subgroup increases their water use in response to the messages. By targeting the messages to subgroups known to be most responsive, program costs could be reduced by over 50% with only a 20% reduction in the treatment effect. Combining theory and data, we also shed light on the mechanisms through which the treatment effects arise, which has implications for program design and future research on the program's welfare effects.","Volume 35, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/3,23
"This paper analyzes how the interaction between green consumers and responsible firms affects the market equilibrium. The main result is that a higher degree of responsibility of consumers and/or firms may both increase and decrease the total abatement and the social welfare. In general an increment in the degree of CSR of a firm entails an increase of its total clean-up and a reduction of the aggregate abatement of its rival. When the rival firm has a high degree of CSR this second effect is stronger than the first and total abatement falls down. At the same time, when the degree of consciousness of consumers and/or firms is very high, responsible firms overprovide environmental quality: in such case a further increment in the level of social responsibility of a market actor may trigger an increase of firms’ total clean-up but a reduction in social welfare.","Volume 35, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/3,23
"We develop a new but simple non-parametric method to diagnose inconsistency in double-bounded contingent valuation questions in the presence of both perfect and imperfect correlation between initial and follow-up response distributions. The proposed method can identify inconsistency in iterative responses at each bid interval. We apply this method to data from five well-known double-bounded contingent valuation surveys. The predictions of our model match closely with parametric outcomes. Further, we find that the inconsistency patterns generally vary for different data sets and different bid intervals within data sets. Therefore no single behavioral model can explain all latent inconsistency patterns either within or across data sets. In addition, we examine the impact of inconsistency in responses on bias and efficiency of the double-bounded format in the absence of correction for inconsistency. We conclude that the commonly cited benefits of the double-bounded format hold only in the special case of nearly perfect consistency between initial and follow-up response distributions. Our method provides a simple tool researchers can use to determine the similarity in response distributions between the initial and follow-up responses and whether incorporating collected follow-up responses are likely to actually increase efficiency without introducing bias.","Volume 35, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/35/issue/3,23

The estimation of a system of equations provides support to both hypotheses. In addition, results suggest that resource abundance might also affect human development by reducing the quality of institutions. However, while statistically significant, this effect is quantitatively small.

The results are compared to those found in the pollution permit literature for a firm with market dominance only in the permit market, to which some additional observations are also added concerning efficiency outcomes under non-compliance.","Volume 34, Issue 2",May 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/34/issue/2,28
"We examine the impact of coastal wind turbines on local coastal tourism and recreation for residents of the northeastern coastal counties in North Carolina. A combination of telephone and web survey data are used to assess the impact of coastal wind farms on trip behavior and site choice. Most of the respondents to our telephone survey claim to support offshore wind energy development, and independent survey data suggest that the observed levels of support may be indicative of the broader population in this region. Overall, we find very little impact of coastal wind turbines on aggregate recreational visitation; loss in annual consumer surplus associated with wide spread wind development in the coastal zone is insignificant at $17 (or about 1.5% of annual consumer surplus). Results suggest that NC local coastal tourists are averse to wind farms in the near-shore zone; average compensating variation for wind farms one mile from the shore is estimated at $55 per household. On average, we find no evidence of aversion to wind farms 4 miles out in the ocean, or for wind farms located in coastal estuaries. For all wind farm scenarios, we find evidence of preference heterogeneity—some respondents find this appealing while others find it aversive.","Volume 34, Issue 1",January 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/34/issue/1,29
"This research examines the physical constraints on the growth process. In order to run, maintain and build capital energy is required to be distributed to geographically dispersed sites where investments are deemed profitable. We capture this aspect of physical reality by a network theory of electricity distribution. The model leads to a supply relation according to which feasible electricity consumption per capita rises with the size of the economy, as measured by capital per capita. Specifically, the relation is a simple power law with an exponent assigned to capital that is bounded between 1/2 and 3/4, depending on the efficiency of the network. Together with an energy conservation equation, capturing instantaneous aggregate demand for electricity, we are able to provide a metabolic-energetic founded law of motion for capital per capita that is mathematically isomorphic to the one emanating from the Solow growth model. Using data for the 50 US states 1960–2000, we examine the determination of growth in electricity consumption per capita and test the model structurally. The model fits the data well. The exponent in the power law connecting capital and electricity is 2/3.","Volume 33, Issue 4, Pages 771-1054 (November 2011)",November 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/4,30
"We discuss eight contributions that combine the topics of sustainable natural resource use and economic dynamics. In the first part we consider enhanced oil recovery (EOR), carbon capture and storage (CCS), as well as innovations allowing for energy-efficiency improvements and renewable energy cost reductions. We discuss how to include these technologies and innovations in CGE models, how each of them has different effects on the timing of emissions and abatement and on total emissions, and how (first-best as well as second-best) complementary policies (in particular, emission taxes and innovation subsidies) differ across these technologies. In the second part we compare differences in intergenerational preferences towards resource conservation - altruistic preferences and concern for social status from relative consumption -and also found sharply contrasting effects across the alternative assumptions.","Volume 33, Issue 4, Pages 771-1054 (November 2011)",November 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/4,30
"In this paper, we present an economic analysis of CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR). This technique entails injection of CO2 into mature oil fields in a manner that reduces the oil's viscosity, thereby enhancing the rate of extraction. As part of this process, significant quantities of CO2 remain sequestered in the reservoir. If CO2 emissions are regulated, oil producers using EOR should therefore be able to earn revenues from sequestration as well as from oil production. We develop a theoretical framework that analyzes the dynamic co-optimization of oil extraction and CO2 sequestration, through the producer's choice of the fraction of CO2 in the injection stream at each moment. We find that the optimal fraction of CO2 is likely to decline monotonically over time, and reach zero before the optimal termination time. Numerical simulations, based on an ongoing EOR project in Wyoming, confirm this result. We also find that cumulative sequestration is less responsive to the carbon tax than to the oil price. Only at very high taxes does a tradeoff between revenues from oil output and sequestration arise.","Volume 33, Issue 4, Pages 771-1054 (November 2011)",November 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/4,30
"This paper studies the timing of subsidies for emissions-saving research and development (R&D) and how innovation policy is influenced by a carbon tax. We develop a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with both general R&D and specific emissions-saving R&D. We find two results that are important when subsidizing emissions-saving R&D in order to target inefficiencies in the research markets. First, the welfare gain from subsidies is larger when the carbon tax is high. This is because a high carbon tax raises the social value of the emissions-saving technology and that this increase in value is not fully appropriated by the private firms. Secondly, the welfare gain is greater when there is a falling time profile of the rate of subsidies for emissions-saving R&D, rather than a constant or increasing profile. The reason is that knowledge spillovers are larger in early periods.","Volume 33, Issue 4, Pages 771-1054 (November 2011)",November 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/4,30
"The paper considers an endogenous growth model with climate change as well as three R&D sectors dedicated to energy, CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) and backstop efficiency. First, we characterize the set of decentralized equilibria: a particular equilibrium is associated with any vector of policy instruments including a carbon tax and a subsidy to each R&D sector. Second, we show that it is possible to express any equilibrium as the solution of a maximization program. Third, we solve the first-best optimum problem and thereby deriving the optimal instruments. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical model using calibrated functional specifications. In particular, we investigate the effects of various combinations of policy instruments (including the optimal ones) by determining the deviation of each corresponding equilibrium from the “laisser-faire” benchmark. We find notably that introducing an R&D subsidy hardly affects emissions when a carbon tax is already implemented, thus revealing a complementary effect between these two policy instruments.","Volume 33, Issue 4, Pages 771-1054 (November 2011)",November 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/4,30
"The paper develops a new type of computable general equilibrium (CGE) model in which growth is fully endogenous, based on the increasing specialization of sector-specific capital varieties. The model is used to simulate the effects of carbon policies on consumption, welfare, and sectoral development in the long run. The benchmark scenario is calculated based on endogenous sector-specific gains from specialization, which carry over to the simulations of a carbon policy following the 2 °C target. Applying the model to the Swiss economy, we find that carbon policy leads to growth rates of knowledge intensive sectors that are higher than in the benchmark and that all the non-energy sectors show positive growth rates. Compared to a state in which climate change has no negative effect, consumption in 2050 is reduced by 4.5% and entails a moderate but not negligible welfare loss.","Volume 33, Issue 4, Pages 771-1054 (November 2011)",November 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/4,30
"In this article we ask whether a privately owned natural renewable resource can be conserved and managed efficiently when households have a joy-of-giving resource bequest motive. We model an overlapping generations economy in which firms have access to a CES production technology combining the natural resource, physical capital and labor. Our results shed light on the interplay between the resource bequest motive and the substitutability/complementarity relationship between capital and the natural resource in the determination of the equilibrium propensity to use the resource. The mere existence of the bequest motive does not guarantee that the resource will be conserved in the long run. When the resource is highly substitutable with capital, the equilibrium actually never exhausts the resource stock whatever the intensity of the bequest motive. When the resource is a poor substitute for capital, the equilibrium preserves the resource only if the taste for bequeathing is strong enough. Be the economy in over-accumulation or in under-accumulation of the natural resource, it always increases aggregate consumption to run the stock of capital at a level lower than the efficiency level.","Volume 33, Issue 4, Pages 771-1054 (November 2011)",November 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/4,30
"This paper studies an endogenous growth model with exhaustible resources, overlapping generations and human capital externalities. In the competitive equilibrium, selfish behavior and inefficient skills accumulation may prevent sustained growth. Implementing the utilitarian optimum likely induces sustainability via increased knowledge formation, but resource depletion may be faster or slower than under laissez-faire depending on the social discount rate. Heavy (modest) social discounting delays (anticipates) the achievement of net welfare gains for newborn agents and successors. The reason is that human capital accumulation magnifies the positive growth effects of policies that lower the rate of resource destruction, preserving the welfare of newborn agents. Resource-depleting policies, instead, hamper growth and reduce lifetime welfare of early-in-time generations—the first loser being the currently young.","Volume 33, Issue 4, Pages 771-1054 (November 2011)",November 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/4,30
"One of the problems associated with the conservation of the environment is that short-lived individuals fail to account for the long-term effects of pollution, which implies that future generations bear the costs imposed by the current generation. Such inter-generational externalities are usually tackled by (Pigovian) taxes, fiscal policy or environmental regulation. Alternatively, we propose that socially responsible investment funds create a role for the stock market to deal with intergenerational environmental externalities. We analyze the role of the stock market in an environmental overlapping generations model of the Diamond-type, in which agents choose between investing in “clean” government bonds or “polluting” firm equity. We show that although socially responsible investors are short-lived, the forward-looking nature of stock prices can help to resolve the conflict between current and future generations.","Volume 33, Issue 4, Pages 771-1054 (November 2011)",November 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/4,30
"This paper presents a simple model of resource extraction where preferences are defined over the individual’s consumption level, her effort and the comparison of her consumption with that of other members of the community. Our specification captures the intuition that lies behind the growing body of empirical evidence that places interpersonal comparisons as a key determinant of well-being. We consider the effect of consumption externalities under two alternative property-rights regimes: perfect property rights and open access. We identify two dimensions along which consumption externalities distort the efficient exploitation of resources, or, in the case of open access, aggravate the over-exploitation of resources: (i) the static trade-off between consumption and leisure, and (ii) the dynamic trade-off between current and future consumption. In general, envious agents over-exploit the natural resource stock, resulting in a steady-state stock lower than the efficient level chosen by a central planner. We propose a tax mechanism to induce the first-best outcome.","Volume 33, Issue 4, Pages 771-1054 (November 2011)",November 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/4,30
"There are many situations where environmental authorities use a mix of environmental policy instruments, rather than one single instrument, to address environmental concerns.

"This paper explains why some governments fail to adopt policies that are sufficiently strong, while others adopt policies that are too stringent. Constructing a political economy model in which voters face uncertainty due to the types of politicians and the risk of environmental damage, we show that there is an equilibrium in which a politician uses a weaker environmental policy rather than efficient direct transfers for redistribution. We also show that there is an equilibrium in which a stricter environmental policy can be implemented by a politician who has no incentive to make transfers. Then, we discuss which equilibrium should be more plausible. We conclude that the latter equilibrium in which a too stringent environmental policy emerges can dominate the former unless the citizen’s estimate of environmental risk is sufficiently low.","Volume 33, Issue 3",September 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/3,31

"A common strategy for limiting the total annual catch in a fishery is to restrict entry and season length. We examine the results of this strategy when entry limitation amounts to a limit on capital, but fishing firms can vary an unrestricted input, and thereby use the restricted input more intensively. Under these regulatory constraints, fishing firms will earn rents that depend on the elasticity of substitution between restricted and unrestricted inputs. Using simulations with data from the Alaskan pollock fishery, rents and season length are shown to depend on fish and variable input prices, sometimes in surprisingly non-monotonic ways.","Volume 33, Issue 2, Pages 351-454 (May 2011)",May 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/2,32

Estimated VSL is highest at age four ($14.1M), falls until age 30 ($3.7M), rises until age 66 ($6.7M), and then falls to $1.5M by age 92.

"In this paper, we develop a paleoeconomic model of the co-evolution of economic specialization and encephalization—the common physiological measure of intelligence as reflected by brain mass relative to total body mass. Our economic analysis links ecological and social intelligence theories of increased encephalization in early hominins through a model in which both economic and ecological feedbacks jointly determined the evolutionary incentives. We focus on degrees of specialization affected by coordination costs with and without market exchange. Our results suggest encephalization would be a process characterized by diminishing returns to behavioral advances. In terms of the long-running debate in economics over whether specialization increases or decreases intelligence, our results suggest from an evolutionary perspective the answer depends on economic/social institutions and how these influence ecological interactions.","Volume 33, Issue 2, Pages 351-454 (May 2011)",May 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/2,32

"The general concern on the environmental implications of the rising demand for coal registered in China during the last few years has induced considerable research effort to produce accurate forecasts of China's energy requirements. Nevertheless, no previous study has modelled the coal demand in China at provincial level. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we estimate and forecast the Chinese demand for coal using panel data disaggregated by provinces and accounting for spatial heterogeneity. Second, given the spatial nature of the data, we explicitly capture the spatial autocorrelation among provinces using spatial econometrics. In particular, we specify the Chinese industrial coal demand at provincial level with fixed-effect spatial models. The empirical results show that the fixed-effect spatial ADL model is able to capture the existing interdependence between provinces. This model forecasts an average annual increase in coal demand to 2010 of nearly 2%.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33
"Suggestions on international cooperation in climate policy beyond 2012 include substituting or complementing international environmental agreements (IEA) with technology-oriented agreements (TOA). We look at the impact of TOA on environmental cooperation in a framework of coalition stability. Using a numerical model, we analyze the differences of several TOA and how they interact. We find that participation in and environmental effectiveness of the IEA are raised less effectively when the TOA focuses on research cooperation in mitigation technology rather than cooperation on augmenting productivity in the private good sector. This is due to the former having an effect on all actors via emissions, whereas effects of the latter are exclusive to research partners. For the same reason, we find that restricting research cooperation to the coalition is only credible when it focuses on productivity. Technology standards that reduce the emission intensity of production are unlikely to raise participation by themselves and may suffer from inefficiencies. However, these disadvantages do not apply when standards are implemented as a complementary instrument. Separately negotiated technology standards may hence facilitate participation in an IEA without adding to its complexity.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33

"The main objective of this paper is to analyze the potential goal conflict between two of Sweden's environmental objectives: Sustainable Forests and Reduced Climate Impact – or, more precisely, the conflict between forest conservation and the supply of wood fuel. To accomplish this, we use a forest sector model that includes the suppliers and major users of roundwood. The econometric results, based on a data set that spans 40 years, show that all the own price elasticities have the expected signs. Among the three forestry products, the supply and (long-term) demand of forest fuel seems to be most sensitive to a price change. In a second step, the estimated model is used to simulate the effect of increased forest conservation – the Sustainable Forest objective – on the supply of wood fuel. If oil is used as a substitute, Swedish emissions of greenhouse gases will increase by almost 0.92 percent, which indicates a clear conflict with the Reduced Climate Impact objective.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33

Further, in an investigation of potential site quality changes, we find that divers are sensitive to scope effects with an additional cave system increasing annual per-person use values by approximately $100, while improved access yields an additional $50 in per-person annual consumer surplus. Finally, three additional model specifications are estimated and indicate that divers use different travel cost preferences when assessing their revealed and stated preference trip counts but a single preference structure to evaluate site quality changes.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33

"This paper proposes a general empirical strategy to estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) for exogenous risk mitigation when environmental risks are endogenous in protective actions and consumers are imperfectly informed about the ambient risk levels. The strategy consists of a set of survey techniques and the dummy endogenous variable model (Heckman, 1978) to control for correlation in unobserved errors that enter the WTP equation and the protection-decision equation. The method is applied to the non-market valuation survey data on arsenic contamination in drinking water. Our results indicate that the estimated WTPs are significantly higher for households without self-protective action. Our approach thus offers not only the correct welfare estimate for exogenous reduction of environmental risks, but also yields policy implications qualitatively much different from the conventional approach. We also estimate the welfare value of the policy to inform and educate the public about the arsenic risk simultaneously with public risk mitigation. The estimated welfare value is similar to, though slightly higher than, that of risk mitigation without information component. This occurs due to the competing effects of information dissemination and risk mitigation efforts.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33
"We study a particular uneven-aged forest stand management pattern, variations of which are often advocated in practice to mitigate the adverse effects of clear cutting. The forest stand under consideration is similar to a Faustmann stand, with the following difference: rather than being single aged, the forest tract contains trees of two age classes so that it is submitted to a form of selective cutting. Each harvest involves all of the older trees and only a fraction of the younger ones; hence the name mixed rotation. Trees left standing at harvest help stimulate natural regeneration and improve various environmental and amenity characteristics of the forest. We model this effect by using a cost function that varies with respect to the harvest rate of younger trees. We derive the properties that this cost function must exhibit in order some form of mixed rotation to be superior to the conventional single rotation à la Faustmann; we also characterize the mixed rotation in terms of duration and the harvest rate of younger trees, and we compare its properties with Faustmann’s rule.RésuméNous étudions un cas particulier d’aménagement forestier inéquien dont diverses variantes sont recommandées pour réduire les inconvénients de la coupe à blanc.

Les arbres non coupés aident la régénération naturelle et améliorent diverses caractéristiques environnementales et esthétiques de la forêt.

We point out initially that a higher tax not only increases demand for abatement; it also makes polluters less sensitive to price. This attracts a larger number of abatement suppliers while possibly inducing each one of them to produce less. Total abatement always goes up, however, when the delivery of abatement goods and services exhibits decreasing returns to scale.

"Habitat loss is a primary cause of loss of biodiversity but conserving habitat for species presents challenges. Land parcels differ in their ability to produce returns for landowners and landowners may have private information about the value of the land to them. Land parcels also differ in the type and quality of habitat and the spatial pattern of land use across multiple landowners is important for determining the conservation value of parcels. This paper analyzes the relative efficiency of simple voluntary incentive-based policies in achieving biodiversity conservation objectives. This topic is important not just for biodiversity conservation but for any effort to provide a public good requiring coordination across multiple decision-makers who have some degree of private information. We develop a method that integrates spatially explicit data, an econometric model of private land-use decisions, landscape simulations, a biological model of biodiversity as a function of landscape pattern, and an algorithm that estimates the set of efficient solutions. These methods allow us to simulate landowner responses to policies, measure the consequences of these decisions for biodiversity conservation, and compare these outcomes to efficient outcomes to show the relative efficiency of various policy approaches. We find substantial differences in biodiversity conservation scores generated by simple voluntary incentive-based policies and efficient solutions. The performance of incentive-based policies is particularly poor at low levels of the conservation budget where spatial fragmentation of conserved parcels is a large concern. Performance can be improved by encouraging agglomeration of conserved habitat and by incorporating basic biological information, such as that on rare habitats, into the selection criteria.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33
"Output-based refunding of environmental policy revenues combines a tax on emissions with a production subsidy, typically in a revenue-neutral fashion. With imperfect competition, subsidies can alleviate output underprovision. However, when market shares are significant, endogenous refunding reduces abatement incentives and the marginal net tax or subsidy. If market shares differ, marginal abatement costs will not be equalized, and production is shifted among participants. In an asymmetric Cournot duopoly, endogenous refunding leads to higher output, emissions, and overall costs compared with a fixed rebate program targeting the same emissions intensity. These results hold whether emissions rates are determined simultaneously with output or strategically in a two-stage model.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33
"Using a dynamic general equilibrium model, we explore the role of habit formation when analyzing green tax reforms under the double dividend hypothesis. We assume increases in energy taxes and adjust capital taxation in a revenue-neutral framework to evaluate the effects on welfare. Since the existence of an environmental dividend is uncontroversial, we mainly focus on the efficiency dividend. Our findings show that, when taxes on household energy consumption increase, habits and transitional dynamics alter household decisions, and change the efficiency dividend. However, when the tax increase is on energy used as an input, reform always induces a welfare cost in terms of efficiency. In this case, habits play a less important role.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33
"Strategic market behavior by permit sellers will harm the European Union (EU) as it is expected to become a large net buyer of permits in a follow-up agreement to the Kyoto Protocol. In this paper, we explore how the EU could benefit from making permit trade agreements with non-EU countries. These trade agreements involve permit sales requirement, complemented by a financial transfer from the EU to the other contract party. Such agreements would enable the EU to act strategically in the permit market on behalf of its member states, although each member state is assumed to behave as a price taker in the permit market. Using a stylized numerical simulation model, we show that an appropriately designed permit trade agreement between the EU and China could significantly cut the EU's total compliance cost. This result is robust for a wide range of parameterizations of the simulation model.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33
"This paper investigates initial allocation choices in an international tradable pollution permit market. For two sovereign governments, we compare allocation choices that are either simultaneously or sequentially announced. We show sequential allocation announcements result in higher (lower) aggregate emissions when announcements are strategic substitutes (complements). Whether allocation announcements are strategic substitutes or complements depends on the relationship between the follower’s damage function and governments’ abatement costs. When the marginal damage function is relatively steep (flat), allocation announcements are strategic substitutes (complements). For quadratic abatement costs and damages, sequential announcements provide a higher level of aggregate emissions.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33
"The purposes of this paper are to determine the sources of energy productivity growth at the provincial level in China and to examine the relative contributions of the sources and their impacts on regional inequality. Energy productivity change is first decomposed into five components attributable to changes in capital–energy ratio, labor–energy ratio, output structure, and technical efficiency change and technological change. Then a nonparametric analysis is implemented to statistically test the relative contributions of the components and their roles in the distribution dynamics of energy productivity. It is found that (1) changes in capital–energy ratio, output structure, and technological change contribute to energy productivity growth in China, (2) increase in capital–energy ratio caused by capital accumulation is the primary driving force for energy productivity growth, and (3) capital accumulation contributes to energy productivity convergence between Chinese provinces over the time period of 1990–2005.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33
"This paper aims at verifying the claim, appeared in recent literature, that it is possible to control for response bias associated to the double bound elicitation method, while keeping gains in efficiency of the WTP estimates. Results from a Monte Carlo analysis lead, in general, to reject the claim; but when initial bids are not correctly chosen, the gains in efficiency are confirmed. An empirical application dealing with WTP estimation for drinking water quality improvements illustrates a case where a flexible modeling approach based on Copula distributions allows relevant gains with respect to the Single Bound estimator.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33
"We study the dynamic behaviour of household electricity consumption on the basis of four large independent surveys conducted in the province of Québec from 1989 to 2002. The latter region displays some rather unique features such as the very extensive use of electricity for space heating in a cold climate and the wide range of energy sources used to meet space heating requirements. We adopt Deaton (1985) approach to create 25 cohorts of households that form a pseudo-panel. The cohorts have on average 131 households. The model error terms allow for group heteroskedasticity and serial correlation. Short-run and long-run own and cross-price elasticities are statistically significant. Electricity and natural gas are estimated to be substitutes while electricity and fuel oil are complements, as it may occur in the Quebec context. The estimate of the income elasticity is not significant.

"The present paper studies the interdependencies between the energy, bioenergy and food prices. We develop a vertically integrated multi-input, multi-output market model with two channels of price transmission: a direct biofuel channel and an indirect input channel. We test the theoretical hypothesis by applying time-series analytical mechanisms to nine major traded agricultural commodity prices, including corn, wheat, rice, sugar, soybeans, cotton, banana, sorghum and tea, along with one weighted average world crude oil price. The data consists of 783 weekly observations extending from January 1994 to December 2008. The empirical findings confirm the theoretical hypothesis that the prices for crude oil and agricultural commodities are interdependent including also commodities not directly used in bioenergy production: an increase in oil price by 1 $/barrel increases the agricultural commodity prices between 0.10 $/tonne and 1.80 $/tonne. Contrary to the theoretical predictions, the indirect input channel of price transmission is found to be small and statistically insignificant.","Volume 33, Issue 1",January 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/33/issue/1,33
"The spread of invasive species (IS) is an inherently spatial process, and management of invasive species occurs over spatially heterogeneous regions, but policy constraints can restrict management responses to be homogeneous across regions. Using a spatial bioeconomic model that includes a representation of invasive species ecology based on heterogeneous environments that are linked across space and time by human and ecological pathways, we compare optimal spatially heterogeneous policy to spatially uniform policy. We explore the magnitude and pattern of the policy differences with emphasis on the influence of different types of underlying heterogeneity across locations.","Volume 32, Issue 4, Pages 477-600 (November 2010)",November 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/4,34
"Invasive species are typically viewed as an economic bad because they cause economic and ecological damages, and can be difficult to control. When direct management is limited, another option is indirect management via bio-controls. Here management is directed at the bio-control species population (e.g., supplementing this population through stocking) with the aim that, through ecological interactions, the bio-control species will control the invader. We focus on stocking salmon to control invasive alewives in Lake Michigan. Salmon are valuable to recreational anglers, and alewives are their primary food source in Lake Michigan. We illustrate how stocking salmon can be used to control alewife, while at the same time alewife can be turned from a net economic bad (having a negative shadow value) into a net economic good (having a positive shadow value) by providing valuable ecosystem services that support the recreational fishery. Using optimal control theory, we solve for a stocking program that maximizes social welfare. Optimal stocking results in cyclical dynamics. We link concepts of natural capital and indirect management, population dynamics, non-convexities, and multiple-use species and demonstrate that species interactions are critical to the values that humans derive from ecosystems. This research also provides insight into the management of salmon fisheries in the Great Lakes.","Volume 32, Issue 4, Pages 477-600 (November 2010)",November 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/4,34
"The presence of invasive species is often not realized until well after the species becomes established. Discovering the location and extent of infestation before the invasive species causes widespread damage typically requires intensive monitoring efforts. In this paper, we analyze the problem of controlling an invasive species when there is imperfect information about the degree of infestation. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process in which the decision-maker receives an imperfect signal about the level of infestation. The decision-maker then chooses a management action to minimize expected costs based on beliefs about the level of infestation. We apply this model to a simple application with three possible levels of infestation where the decision-maker can choose to take no action, only monitor, only treat, or do both monitoring and treatment jointly. We solve for optimal management as a function of beliefs about the level of infestation. For a case with positive monitoring and treatment costs, we find that the optimal policy involves choosing no action when there is a sufficiently large probability of no infestation, monitoring alone with intermediate probability values and treatment alone when the probability of moderate or high infestation is large. We also show how optimal management and expected costs change as the cost or quality of information from monitoring changes. With costless and perfect monitoring, expected costs are 20–30% lower across the range of belief states relative to the expected costs without monitoring.","Volume 32, Issue 4, Pages 477-600 (November 2010)",November 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/4,34
"We consider the problem of management of an aquatic invader spreading in a lake system. We assume that each year the invader can be removed from a certain proportion of invaded lakes, which depends on the selected intensity of control. Control decisions are generated and compared for an optimally controlled system and for a static optimization across asymptotic steady states. Control close to eradication of the invasive species is always optimal for invasions with relatively high damages, low rates of density dependent spread and/or low chance of additional random introductions. Control to a highly invaded steady state is optimal for those invasions with low relative damages, high chances of random introduction and high levels of uncertainty in species location. In all other cases the optimal outcome depends upon initial conditions. Comparing the relative performance of the optimally controlled system and the static optimization demonstrates situations when the differences are small and when not. When invasions are acted upon in their later stages and across certain parameter combinations a static optimization provides a reasonable approximation of an optimally controlled system. The flip-side is that optimal policies directed at an invasion in its early stages tend to provide significantly savings. The savings vary across parameter combinations, yet in these situations little useful insight will be generated without consideration of a dynamically optimized system.","Volume 32, Issue 4, Pages 477-600 (November 2010)",November 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/4,34
"By their direct effects on private profitability, invasive agricultural pests create special incentives for management that set them apart from other categories of invasive species. One attractive nonchemical management approach for agricultural pests relies upon biological control by natural enemies. By improving the habitat of natural enemies of invasive agricultural pests, biological pest control can become privately attractive. This study develops a spatial optimization model to explore economically optimal spatial configuration of natural enemy habitat in agricultural landscapes. The model is applied to the management of soybean aphid (Aphis glycines), a recent invasive pest species of soybean production systems in the North Central region of the United States. Results indicate that non-crop habitat management can be a promising pest management option for organic cropping systems. Under current prices, however, habitat management tends to reduce net returns for conventional farms. Both area and configuration of non-crop habitats affect economic performance, with the greatest value coming from small, scattered areas of habitat.","Volume 32, Issue 4, Pages 477-600 (November 2010)",November 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/4,34
"Economic impacts from invasive species, conveyed as expected damages to assets from invasion and expected costs of successful prevention and/or removal, may vary significantly across spatially differentiated landscapes. We develop a spatial–dynamic model for optimal early detection and rapid response (EDRR) policies, commonly exploited in the management of potential invaders around the world, and apply it to the case of the Brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis) in Oahu, Hawaii. EDRR consists of search activities beyond the ports of entry, where search (and potentially removal) efforts are targeted toward areas where credible evidence suggests the presence of an invader. EDRR costs are a spatially dependent variable related to the ease or difficulty of searching an area, while damages are assumed to be a population-dependent variable. A myopic strategy in which search only occurs when and where current expected net returns are positive is attractive to managers, and, we find, significantly lowers present value losses (by $270 m over 30 years). We find further that in the tradeoff between search costs and damages avoided, early and aggressive measures that search some high priority areas beyond points of entry even when current costs of search exceed current damages can save the island more ($295 m over 30 years). Extensive or non-targeted search is not advised however.","Volume 32, Issue 4, Pages 477-600 (November 2010)",November 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/4,34

"We model coastal groundwater management and its effects on submarine groundwater discharge, nearshore marine water quality, and marine biota. Incorporating the stock externality effects on nearshore resources increases the optimal sustainable steady-state levels of both the aquifer head and the stock of a keystone native algae species. Numerical simulations are illustrated using data from the Kuki’o region on the Island of Hawaii. Two different approaches for incorporating the nearshore resource are examined. Including algae's market value in the objective function results in only slightly lower rates of groundwater extraction. When a minimum constraint is placed on the stock of the keystone species, however, greater conservation may be indicated. The constraint also results in non-monotonic paths of water extraction, head level, and marginal opportunity cost of water in the optimal solution.","Volume 32, Issue 3",August 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/3,35
"This paper analyses the potential welfare gains of introducing a technology transfer from Annex I to non-Annex I in order to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Our analysis is based on a numerical general equilibrium model for a world-economy comprising two regions; North (Annex I) and South (non-Annex I). In a cooperative equilibrium, a technology transfer from the North to the South is clearly desirable from the perspective of a ‘global social planner’, since the welfare gain for the South outweighs the welfare loss for the North. However, if the regions do not cooperate, then the incentives to introduce the technology transfer appear to be relatively weak from the perspective of the North; at least if we allow for Southern abatement in the pre-transfer Nash equilibrium. Finally, by adding the emission reductions associated with the Kyoto agreement, our results show that the technology transfer leads to higher welfare in both regions.","Volume 32, Issue 3",August 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/3,35
"A carbon tax is often cited by economists as an effective instrument to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, but there is little political interest in the United States. In light of this political unpopularity, we develop and examine a net-revenue constrained carbon tax and subsidy program. The optimal revenue constrained tax and subsidy schedule based on our utility maximization model taxes energy sources with high emissions to energy price ratio, and subsidizes sources with low emissions to energy price ratios. This approach may be more palatable than a traditional carbon tax because it can change the relative price of low and high emissions energy sources while providing a mechanism to limit net tax increases and energy price increases. We find that a constrained tax/subsidy program provides welfare gains relative to a no-tax scenario. Welfare gains are estimated to be 1% and 36% of the welfare gains from a Pigouvian tax for the motor fuels industry and electric power industry, respectively. In contrast, subsidies for low-emitting energy sources funded from general tax funds rather than from high-emission energy tax revenues lead to welfare decreases substantially below our proposed tax/subsidy policy approach.","Volume 32, Issue 3",August 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/3,35
"Following the U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, electric utilities dramatically increased their utilization of low-sulfur coal from the Powder River Basin (PRB). Recent studies indicate that railroads hauling PRB coal exercise a substantial degree of market power and that relative price changes in the mining and transportation sectors were contributing factors to the observed pattern of input substitution. This paper asks the related question: To what extent does more stringent SO2 policy stimulate input substitution from high-sulfur coal to low-sulfur coal when railroads hauling low-sulfur coal exercise spatial monopoly power? The question underpins the effectiveness of incentive-based environmental policies given the essential role of market performance in input, output, and abatement markets in determining the social cost of regulation. Our analysis indicates that environmental regulation leads to negligible input substitution effects when clean and dirty inputs are highly substitutable and the clean input market is mediated by a spatial monopolist.","Volume 32, Issue 3",August 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/3,35
"There is much uncertainty about the effects of anthropogenic climate change on the frequency and severity of extreme weather events like hailstorms, and subsequent economic losses, while this is also relevant information for the design of climate policy. Few studies conducted indicate that a strong positive relation exists between hailstorm activity and hailstorm damage, as predicted by minimum temperatures using simple correlations. This relation suggests that hailstorm damage may increase in the future if global warming leads to further temperature increase. This study estimates a range of Tobit models of relations between normalized insured hailstorm damage to agriculture and several temperature and precipitation indicators for the Netherlands. Temporal dynamics are explicitly modelled. A distinction is made between damage costs for greenhouse horticulture and outdoor farming, which appear to be differently affected by variability in weather. ‘Out of sample’ forecast tests show that a combination of maximum temperatures and precipitation predicts hailstorm damage best. Extrapolations of the historical relations between hailstorm damage and weather indicators under climate change scenarios project a considerable increase in future hailstorm damage. Our estimates show that by 2050 annual hailstorm damage to outdoor farming could increase by between 25% and 50%, with considerably larger impacts on greenhouse horticulture in summer of more than 200%. The economic implications of more hailstorm damage for, and adaptation by, the agricultural and insurance sectors are discussed.","Volume 32, Issue 3",August 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/3,35
"Starting in 2009 the EU ban on the sale of incandescent bulbs will force households to purchase energy-saving compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). The impact of the ban on consumers will depend on the nature of current barriers to the use of CFLs. This paper employs a Double-Hurdle model to identify distinct barriers to household consideration of CFLs and to the subsequent intensity of adoption using a large survey of German households. Barriers to CFL consideration are found to be low for all households, except those with very low incomes. Barriers to CFL consideration are, however, strongly linked to the residential characteristics of low-income households like small size and to the lack of household knowledge of energy consumption. CFLs use will increase after the ban mainly through a rise in the intensity of adoption. But the ban will be costly to consumers because the range of applications where households chose to employ CFLs is limited, particularly for high income households.","Volume 32, Issue 3",August 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/3,35
"In this paper we analyze the dynamic implications of recycling for resource use, the level of economic activity and the long-run development of the economy. In contrast to former approaches, we take explicit account of the circulation of matter in the economy. We consider virgin resources and recycled wastes as essential inputs to production. These material inputs either end up as waste after consumption or are bound in the capital stock—depending on the utilization of the produced output. As accumulating wastes can be recycled and again be employed in production, the waste stock serves as a source of valuable inputs in our model. We focus on the implications of recycling-related market failures and the integration of material balances on the dynamics of the economy. It is shown that a market for waste and subsidies to resource extractors and recycling firms can restore optimality in the decentralized economy.","Volume 32, Issue 3",August 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/3,35
"This paper analyzes the environmental preferences and pressures of customers in environmentally conscious markets influencing the number of adoptions of ISO 14001—the international standard certified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) concerning an Environmental Management System (EMS)—in a country. Customers in different countries have different priorities and ideas with regard to the environment and its management, and therefore it is possible that environmental preferences and pressures of customers in environmentally conscious markets are greater, although many earlier studies suggest that foreign customers generally form a significant stakeholder group encouraging the adoption of ISO 14001. A random-effects Tobit estimation using a sample of 155 countries over eight years supports the view that the environmental preferences and pressures of customers in environmentally conscious markets (including Finland, Japan, Germany and Denmark) are more likely to encourage domestic along with foreign suppliers to adopt ISO 14001. As it is easier for firms in environmentally conscious markets to adopt ISO 14001 because of their better economic performance, they have already adopted certification and consequently require their domestic and foreign suppliers to do likewise in the global supply chain. For this reason, suppliers wishing to access environmentally conscious markets can obtain an advantage with ISO 14001 certification.","Volume 32, Issue 3",August 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/3,35

"It is often argued that attribute adjustments made possible within choice experiments have the potential to improve benefit transfer accuracy. These transfers, however, often omit socioeconomic adjustments; this reflects a limited presence of socioeconomic covariates in broader choice experiments. The lack of correspondence between common guidance that socioeconomic adjustments should be applied and simultaneous arguments for the advantages of choice experiment transfers leads to ambiguity for transfer practice. This paper contrasts the change in transfer performance resulting from an ability to adjust for policy attributes with that resulting from an ability to adjust for socioeconomic attributes. Results are illustrated for the case of agricultural land preservation. The goal is to provide evidence regarding the tradeoff faced by practitioners who seek to use choice experiments for benefit transfer but lack the ability to adjust for socioeconomic attributes.","Volume 32, Issue 3",August 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/3,35

"This paper develops a screening model to examine the relationship between alternative sources of private capital and investment in environmentally sound technologies (ESTs). In the model, a polluter (agent) must secure investment funds from the international financial markets in order to upgrade its production and abatement technology. The requisite capital can be obtained via either market loans (debt finance) or foreign direct investment (FDI). Under debt finance, the foreign financier supplies only capital and the relationship between the two parties is more ‘arms-length’. By contrast, under FDI, the investor delivers both capital and managerial skills. We use the model to derive the implications of debt finance for optimal investment decisions and compare them to those obtained under FDI. Investment incentives are more pronounced under debt finance.","Volume 32, Issue 3",August 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/3,35

"The implementation of spatial regulations has become a mainstay in fisheries management. These regulations have generated a sizable economics literature focused on the spatial behavior of fishermen. Fundamental to these studies is the consideration set (spatial alternatives) assumed by the researcher to be possessed by the decision agent. Often times this consideration set is assumed to be the entire spatial extent of the fishery. This research proposes the use of finite mixture modeling to endogenously estimate the formation of consideration sets and the method is applied to a unique spatial decision environment, the Atka mackerel fishery in the Aleutian Islands. Consideration sets are modeled using different macro-definitions of spatial regions to focus the micro-level spatial decision making within the fishery and to investigate the sensitivity of the results to alternative macro-level spatial definitions. Results illustrate the biases associated with traditional consideration set assumptions by estimating fishermen's valuations for different high-value sites within the Aleutian Islands under alternative consideration set assumptions. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how a model that assumes some structure on potential consideration sets reduces the dimensionality problems associated with other endogenous approaches to choice set definition.","Volume 32, Issue 2, Pages 93-276 (April 2010)",April 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/2,36
"Spatial spillovers—interaction effects among neighboring agents in space—are a common characteristic of a variety of processes that are of interest to environmental and resource economists. Empirical identification of these interactions is challenging, however, due to the endogenous nature of the interactions and the inevitable unobserved spatial correlation that, if uncontrolled, can result in spurious estimates of the interaction parameters. Traditional spatial econometric models rely on maintained assumptions that impose separate structures for the spatial error and interaction processes and thus are insufficient for solving this identification problem. To identify spatial land use spillovers in a hedonic model of residential housing values, we pursue an alternative approach by exploiting a natural experiment in the data. We use exogenous physical land features that impose a direct constraint on residential development on some, but not all, of the land that falls within our study region and use this to construct a “partial population identifier.” We find that this estimation strategy solves the endogeneity problem and reduces spatial error autocorrelation, but does not fully eliminate it. Estimation of the model using a more restricted sample in combination with the partial population identification strategy is successful in eliminating the remaining spatial error autocorrelation. We conclude that less restrictive approaches to controlling for unobserved spatial correlation, such as the natural experiment pursued here, may provide a superior alternative to identifying spatial spillovers.","Volume 32, Issue 2, Pages 93-276 (April 2010)",April 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/2,36
"Most existing economic analyses of optimal groundwater management use single-cell aquifer models, which assume that an aquifer responds uniformly and instantly to groundwater pumping. In this paper, we develop an economic model of groundwater management that explicitly incorporates spatial dynamic groundwater flow equations. Calibration of our model to published economic studies of specific aquifers demonstrates that existing studies generally incorrectly estimate the magnitude of the groundwater pumping externality relative to spatially explicit models. In particular, for large aquifers with surface areas of thousands of square miles, the marginal pumping externality predicted by single-cell models may be orders of magnitude less than that predicted by a spatially explicit model, even at large distances from a pumping well. Conversely, for small aquifers with areas of a few hundred square miles or less, single-cell models reasonably approximate the pumping externality. Application of single-cell models to inappropriate settings may result in misleading policy implications due to understatement of the magnitude and spatial nature of the groundwater externality.","Volume 32, Issue 2, Pages 93-276 (April 2010)",April 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/2,36

It demonstrates the importance of spatial aspects of PA management, reveals the inefficiency of many PA policies, and supports explicitly spatial management schemes such as extraction zones.

"Exurban areas have increasingly become zones of conflict as conservation and development compete for the same finite land resources. Conversion of natural areas to land dominated by human use results in loss, degradation, and fragmentation of wildlife habitat which often lead to species endangerment or even extinction. Recently, reserve site selection models have begun to integrate spatial attributes in order to design more compact and connected reserve networks that are thought to improve long-term species persistence. While these models are a good step forward to designing conservation reserve networks, they might not be adequate for use in exurban areas that consist of heterogeneous mosaics of land uses where habitat fragmentation already exists and not all parcels are available for preservation. This paper presents a species conservation framework that expands upon traditional reserve site selection models in three ways. First, because of the focus on exurban areas, the framework used here allows for land conversion within core habitat patches. Second, the framework provides a more robust assessment of connectivity among patches by accounting for land-use heterogeneity in the dispersal matrix. And third, the framework explicitly incorporates species population dynamics. We apply our conservation framework to the case of pond-breeding salamanders in an exurban community in Rhode Island, USA. Comparisons are made between the outcomes for uniform conservation policies and more flexible policies that accommodate ecological and economic heterogeneity. As expected, policies that offer more flexibility in the decision-making process are less costly in terms of foregone development. Conservation planners should consider core habitat patches, dispersal matrix, and spatial scale in their decision making. By not assessing the potential impact of dispersal barriers, reserve site selection models will result in conservation plans that may not protect species over the long term, particularly for species residing in highly fragmented landscapes such as those found in many exurban communities.","Volume 32, Issue 2, Pages 93-276 (April 2010)",April 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/2,36
"The dominant paradigm of conservation-reserve planning in economics is to optimize the provision of physical conservation benefits given a budget constraint, implicitly assuming the value of biodiversity and ecosystem function is not affected by human proximity to that natural capital. There is evidence, however, that human willingness to pay (WTP) for conservation declines with distance—a phenomenon we call “spatial value decay”. This paper begins a new strand of the conservation planning literature that takes demand-side factors – location of people in the landscape, the degree to which WTP for conservation depends on proximity – into account. We use theoretical models of linear abstract landscapes to explore the impact of demand-side factors on two facets of conservation choices: siting of a single reserve when conservation potential is greatest near a critical site, and siting of multiple reserves when fragmentation reduces physical conservation services produced. Our results show how planners should sometimes employ increased fragmentation to capture value when people's preferences are not very highly localized, and how optimal policy balances proximity to the ecologically critical site with proximity to people. In some scenarios, the payoff to using a reserve design approach that considers demand-side factors is large, but we find that spatial value decay reduces the benefits that can be gained from any conservation-planning approach.","Volume 32, Issue 2, Pages 93-276 (April 2010)",April 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/2,36
"Recreation demand models frequently are used to explain outdoor recreation behavior and to estimate willingness to pay for changes in environmental quality at recreation sites. Among the most commonly used recreation demand models are site choice models based on the multinomial logit framework, which account for the spatial relationships between each recreator's home and multiple alternative destinations thereby capturing the substitution possibilities among recreation sites. However, standard applications of this framework typically do not account for the possibility of spatial connections among the sites via movements of the target species, such as fish in connected water bodies in recreational angling applications or terrestrial species in hunting or wildlife viewing applications. In this paper we examine aspects of environmental valuation and natural resource dynamics that generally are addressed separately. Specifically, we show that in such spatially connected systems, a “reduced form” application of the standard site choice modeling approach, using proxy measures of environmental quality rather than direct measures of species abundances, can produce biased estimates of willingness to pay for environmental improvements. Furthermore, we show that under some conditions poorly targeted environmental improvements in spatially connected systems can lead to welfare decreases. In such systems a structural model of recreator site choices and species sorting behavior and population dynamics may be required to fully account for the spatial linkages among sites and the feedback effects between recreators and the target species.","Volume 32, Issue 2, Pages 93-276 (April 2010)",April 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/2,36
"We combine a new economic geography model of agglomeration and dispersion of economic activity with an ecological–economic model of species diversity to examine optimal policies of biodiversity conservation in a two-region world. Species diversity is inevitably impaired by anthropogenic impact. Thus, the economic and ecological systems compete for space and the question arises as to how this conflict should be resolved. The decisive parameters of the model are related to biological diversity (endemism vs. redundancy of species) and the patterns of economic geography (centrifugal vs. centripetal forces). As regards the choice of environmental-policy instruments, it is shown that Pigouvian taxes do not always establish the optimal allocation.","Volume 32, Issue 2, Pages 93-276 (April 2010)",April 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/2,36
"Connected habitats are ecologically more valuable than isolated habitats for many species. A key challenge when designing payments for biodiversity in fragmented landscapes is to increase the spatial connectivity of habitats. Based on the idea of an agglomeration bonus we consider a scheme in which land-owners only receive payments if habitats are arranged in an ecologically favourable configuration. We compare the cost-effectiveness of agglomeration payments to spatially homogeneous payments on a conceptual level. Our results suggest that positive efficiency gains exist for agglomeration payments. We use Large Blue butterfly habitat in Germany as a specific case study, and find the agglomeration payments may lead to cost-savings of nearly 70% relative to homogenous payments.","Volume 32, Issue 2, Pages 93-276 (April 2010)",April 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/2,36
"This paper studies incentives to develop advanced pollution abatement technology when technology may spillover across agents and pollution abatement is a public good. We are motivated by a variety of pollution control issues where solutions require the development and implementation of new pollution abatement technologies. We show that at the Nash equilibrium of a simultaneous-move game with R&D investment and emission abatement, whether the free rider effect prevails and under-investment and excess emissions occur depends on the degree of technology spillovers and the effect of R&D on the marginal abatement costs. There are cases in which, contrary to conventional wisdom, Nash equilibrium investments in emissions reductions exceed the first-best case.","Volume 32, Issue 1",January 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/1,37
"This paper presents a new approach to obtaining unbiased estimates of the value of a statistical life (VSL) with labor market data. Investigating job changes, we combine the advantages of recent panel studies, allowing us to control for unobserved heterogeneity of workers, and conventional cross-sectional estimations, which are less affected by measurement error. We find a VSL of 6.1 million euros from pooled cross-sectional estimation, 1.5 million euros from the first-differences panel model and 2.0 million euros from the job-changer specification. Thus, ignoring individual heterogeneity causes overestimates of the VSL, whereas the attenuation bias in panel data models leads to underestimates of the VSL. Our results are less biased than former results and can be used to perform cost–benefit analyses of public projects aimed at reducing fatality risks, e.g., in the domains of environmental, health, or traffic policy.","Volume 32, Issue 1",January 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/1,37
"We investigate the Hartwick rule for saving of a nation necessary to sustain a constant level of private consumption for a small open economy with an exhaustible stock of natural resources. The amount by which a country saves and invests less than the marginal resource rents equals the expected capital gains on reserves of natural resources plus the expected increase in interest income on net foreign assets plus the expected fall in the cost of resource extraction due to expected improvements in extraction technology. Effectively, depletion is then postponed until better times. This suggests that it is not necessarily sub-optimal for resource-rich countries to have negative genuine saving. However, in countries with different groups with imperfectly defined property rights on natural resources, political distortions induce faster resource depletion than suggested by the Hotelling rule. Fractionalised societies with imperfect property rights build up more foreign assets than their marginal resource rents, but in the long run accumulate less foreign assets than homogenous societies. Hence, such societies end up with lower sustainable consumption and are worse off, especially if seepage is strong, the number of rival groups is large and the country does not enjoy much monopoly power on the resource market. Genuine saving is zero in such societies. However, World Bank genuine saving figures based on market rather than accounting prices will be negative, albeit less so in more fractionalised societies with less secure property rights.","Volume 32, Issue 1",January 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/1,37
"The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it exhibits that standard tools in the measurement of income inequality, such as the Lorenz curve and the Gini-index, can successfully be applied to the issues of inequality measurement of carbon emissions and the equity of abatement policies across countries. These tools allow policy-makers and the general public to grasp at a single glance the impact of conventional distribution rules such as equal caps or grandfathering, or more sophisticated ones, on the distribution of greenhouse gas emissions. Second, using the Samuelson rule for the optimal provision of a public good, the Pareto-optimal distribution of carbon emissions is compared with the distribution that follows if countries follow Nash–Cournot abatement strategies. It is shown that the Pareto-optimal distribution under the Samuelson rule can be approximated by the equal cap division, represented by the diagonal in the Lorenz curve diagram.","Volume 32, Issue 1",January 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/32/issue/1,37

"This study looks at the effects of the choice between taxes and permits on the pattern of adoption of a new (pollution) emissions abatement technology. It uses a dynamic setting, where the regulator observes the arrival and initial use of the technology and determines the optimal ex post amount of emissions before firms start to adopt the technology.In the model here, the adoption benefits and costs depend on the number of firms that are already using the technology. Thus, each firm decides the optimal date to adopt the technology, considering its benefits and costs, as well as the advantage they will gain over their rivals, producing a sequence of adoption that is “diffused” into the industry over time.With this framework, the study shows that when the output demand is elastic, auctioned permits induce an earlier diffusion than taxes.","Volume 31, Issue 4",November 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/4,38
"This paper derives the optimal fishery harvest policy in a real-option model with a stochastic logistic growth process, harvest-sensitive output price, and both fixed and variable harvesting costs. The policy specifies the harvest trigger and harvest size, while outputs from the model include the value of the fishery and the risk of extinction. The optimal policy is illustrated with data from the Pacific Halibut Fishery. For this particular case, the optimal policy recommends harvesting when the fish stock rises to about three-quarters the environmental carrying capacity, and the amount harvested should be approximately a quarter of the prevailing stock. This harvesting policy maximizes the value of the fishery, and importantly, the resulting risk of extinction is negligible. We also carry out some sensitivity analysis to see how the optimal policy (and the resulting fishery value and risk of extinction) change when the input parameters are varied, particularly the ecological parameters intrinsic growth rate and volatility of the stock, and also the economic parameters that have been ignored in previous papers (price sensitivity and fixed cost). If the optimal policy is followed, the risk of extinction will be negligible, except for very low growth rate and high volatility.","Volume 31, Issue 4",November 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/4,38
"This study develops a utility theoretic demand model for an arbitrary number of goods that handles correlation between goods and over time. The bivariate compound Poisson estimator is applied to a semi-logarithmic incomplete demand system to estimate the demand for wilderness recreation and the associated welfare measures both prior to and post a 40,000 acre wilderness fire in Washington. Forest fires can simultaneously affect the environmental qualities of many recreational sites; this highlights the need for a utility theoretic demand system approach for modeling consumer behavior that handles the dynamic behavioral and statistical interdependencies over goods and time. Results suggest an increase in consumer welfare per trip post fire, after an initial period of low values, relative to before the fire.","Volume 31, Issue 4",November 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/4,38
"This paper analyses the role of global land management alternatives in determining potential greenhouse gas mitigation by land-based activities in agriculture and forestry. Land-based activities are responsible for over a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet the economics of land-use decisions have not been explicitly modeled in global mitigation studies. In this paper, we develop a new, general equilibrium framework which effectively captures the opportunity costs of land-use decisions in agriculture and forestry, thereby allowing us to analyse competition for heterogeneous land types across and within sectors, as well as input substitution between land and other factors of production. When land-using sectors are confronted with a tax on greenhouse gas emissions, we find significant changes in the global pattern of comparative advantage across sectors, regions, and land types. Globally, we find that forest carbon sequestration is the dominant strategy for GHG emissions mitigation, while agricultural-related mitigation comes predominantly from reduced methane emissions in the ruminant livestock sector, followed by fertilizer and methane emissions from paddy rice. Regionally, agricultural mitigation is a larger share of total land-use emissions abatement in the USA and China, compared to the rest of the world, and, within agriculture, disproportionately from reductions in fertilizer-related emissions. The results also show how analyses that only consider regional mitigation, may bias mitigation potential by ignoring global market interactions. For example, USA-specific analyses likely over-estimate the potential for abatement in agriculture. Finally, we note that this general equilibrium framework provides the research community with a practical methodology for explicit modeling of global land competition and land-based mitigation in comprehensive assessments of greenhouse gas mitigation options.","Volume 31, Issue 4",November 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/4,38
"This paper focuses on an emissions permit market dominated by one firm and with a government concerned about social efficiency and permits revenue. In this setting, it is shown that the dominant firm's market power reduces the opportunities for the government to raise non-distortionary revenue from permits without loss of consumer surplus. Since the government's objectives are thus hampered in auctioning permits, the dominant firm should be excluded from the auction. Specifically, the regulator should sell permits directly, through bilateral negotiation, to the dominant firm, and auction off the remaining permits to the fringe firms.","Volume 31, Issue 4",November 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/4,38
"In this paper, we distinguish between factor/output substitution and shifts in the production technology frontier. Our model includes the by-products of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions where the function requires the simultaneous expansion of good outputs and reductions in emissions. We estimate a directional output distance function for 80 countries over the period 1971–2000 to measure the exogenous and oil price-induced technological change. On average, we find substantial oil price-induced technological progress at the world level when long-term oil prices are rising, although the growth rate is more volatile in developed countries than in developing countries. The results also show that developed countries experience higher exogenous technological progress in comparison with developing countries, and the gap between the two has increased during the period of our study.","Volume 31, Issue 4",November 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/4,38
"There are currently several ideas on the table for a climate treaty post-Kyoto. We consider the impact on China of three ideas: a cap on the CO2 intensity, a cap on the CO2 level, and a cap on the CO2 intensity in key sectors. We find that a cap on the CO2 intensity gives large environmental co-benefits to China on aggregate, but there are significant negative effects for rural households. Assuming these are addressed the country could reduce its CO2 intensity by a third before costs outweigh environmental co-benefits. By contrast a cap confined to the manufacturing and power sector does not bring substantial co-benefits to China.","Volume 31, Issue 3",August 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/3,39
"This article presents the findings of a combined cost-benefit analysis of local air pollution and global climate change, two subjects that are usually studied separately. Yet these distinct environmental problems are closely related, since they are both driven by the nature of present energy production and consumption patterns. Our study demonstrates the mutual relevance of, and interaction between, policies designed to address these two environmental challenges individually. Given the many dimensions air pollution control and climate change management have in common, it is surprising that they have only little been analyzed in combination so far. We attempt to cover at least part of the existing gap in the literature by assessing how costs and benefits of technologies and strategies that jointly tackle these two environmental problems can best be balanced. By using specific technological options that cut down local air pollution, e.g. related to particulate emissions, one may concurrently reduce CO2 emissions and thus contribute to diminishing global climate change. Inversely, some of the long-term climate change strategies simultaneously improve the quality of air in the short run. We have extended the well-established MERGE model by including emissions of particulate matter, and show that integrated environmental policies generate net global welfare benefits. We also demonstrate that the discounted benefits of local air pollution reduction significantly outweigh those of global climate change mitigation, at least by a factor of 2, but in most cases of our sensitivity analysis much more. Still, we do not argue to only restrict energy policy today to what should be our first priority, local air pollution control, and wait with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, we propose to design policies that simultaneously address these issues, as their combination creates an additional climate change bonus. As such, climate change mitigation proves an ancillary benefit of air pollution reduction, rather than the other way around.","Volume 31, Issue 3",August 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/3,39
"The EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) is breaking new ground in the experience with emission trading regimes across multiple jurisdictions. Since the EU ETS covers only some industries, it implies a hybrid emission control scheme where EU member states must apply complementary domestic emissions regulation for the non-trading sectors of their economies in order to comply with their national emission reduction targets. The EU ETS thus opens up for strategic partitioning of national emissions budgets by the member states between trading and non-trading sectors. In this paper we examine the potential effects of such strategic behavior on compliance cost and emissions prices. We show that concerns on efficiency losses from strategic partitioning are misplaced. In turn, our analysis implicitly indicates significant political economy forces behind EU climate policy, as both cost-effective and strategically motivated partitioning of national emission budgets are far off from the actual break-down between trading and non-trading sectors.","Volume 31, Issue 3",August 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/3,39
"This paper investigates the potential for systematic errors in the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) widely used Annual Energy Outlook, focusing on the near- to mid-term projections of energy demand. Based on analysis of the EIA's 22-year projection record, we find a fairly modest but persistent tendency to underestimate total energy demand by an average of 2 percent per year after controlling for projection errors in gross domestic product, oil prices, and heating/cooling degree days. For 14 individual fuels/consuming sectors routinely reported by the EIA, we observe a great deal of directional consistency in the errors over time, ranging up to 7 percent per year. Electric utility renewables, electric utility natural gas, transportation distillate, and residential electricity show significant biases on average. Projections for certain other sectors have significant unexplained errors for selected time horizons. Such independent evaluation can be useful for validating analytic efforts and for prioritizing future model revisions.","Volume 31, Issue 3",August 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/3,39
"The Pacific Island countries are small island economies that are increasingly dependent on energy for growth and development, yet highly susceptible to climate change. Thus, the relationship between energy consumption and GDP is crucial for realizing their future development and growth objectives. This article tests for Granger causality and provides long-run structural estimates for the relationship between energy consumption, GDP and urbanization for a panel of Pacific Island countries. For the panel as a whole in the long-run there is bidirectional Granger causality between energy consumption and GDP and these variables exert a positive impact on each other. A 1% increase in energy consumption increases GDP by 0.11%, while a 1% increase in GDP increases energy consumption by 0.23%. The findings suggest that for the panel as a whole these countries should increase investment in energy infrastructure and regulatory reform of energy infrastructure to improve delivery efficiency, continue to promote alternative energy sources and put in place energy conservation policies to reduce unnecessary wastage. These strategies seek to realize the dual objectives of reducing the adverse effects of energy use on the environment, while avoiding the negative effect on economic growth of reducing energy consumption.","Volume 31, Issue 3",August 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/3,39
"According to intuition and theories of diffusion, consumer preferences develop along with technological change. However, most economic models designed for policy simulation unrealistically assume static preferences. To improve the behavioral realism of an energy–economy policy model, this study investigates the “neighbor effect,” where a new technology becomes more desirable as its adoption becomes more widespread in the market. We measure this effect as a change in aggregated willingness to pay under different levels of technology penetration. Focusing on hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), an online survey experiment collected stated preference (SP) data from 535 Canadian and 408 Californian vehicle owners under different hypothetical market conditions.Revealed preference (RP) data was collected from the same respondents by eliciting the year, make and model of recent vehicle purchases from regions with different degrees of HEV popularity: Canada with 0.17% new market share, and California with 3.0% new market share. We compare choice models estimated from RP data only with three joint SP–RP estimation techniques, each assigning a different weight to the influence of SP and RP data in coefficient estimates. Statistically, models allowing more RP influence outperform SP influenced models. However, results suggest that because the RP data in this study is afflicted by multicollinearity, techniques that allow more SP influence in the beta estimates while maintaining RP data for calibrating vehicle class constraints produce more realistic estimates of willingness to pay. Furthermore, SP influenced coefficient estimates also translate to more realistic behavioral parameters for CIMS, allowing more sensitivity to policy simulations.","Volume 31, Issue 3",August 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/3,39

"In rich economies emissions of many pollutants tend to grow at a slower rate than GDP. This could be a result of shifting comparative advantages. If so, net imports of dirty products to these economies will increase and rather than reduced, emissions will be relocated to other countries. In this paper we investigate if decoupling in a rich, open economy coincides with such pollution leakages abroad. Based on historical observations and model projections, we find little evidence to support this hypothesis. Historically, decoupling coincides with falling pollution leakages. Projections over a period of decades indicate a weakening of the decoupling, but that leakages will increase.","Volume 31, Issue 2",May 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/2,40
"Stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) at levels expected to prevent dangerous climate changes has become an important, long-term global objective. It is therefore crucial to identify a cost-effective way to achieve this objective. In this paper, we use WITCH, a hybrid climate–energy–economy model, to obtain a quantitative assessment of equilibrium strategies that stabilize CO2 concentrations at 550 or 450 ppm. Since technological change is endogenous and multifaceted in WITCH, and the energy sector is modeled in detail, we can provide a description of the ideal combination of technical progress and alternative energy investment paths in achieving the sought stabilization targets. Given that the model accounts for interdependencies and spillovers across 12 regions of the world, equilibrium strategies are the outcome of a dynamic game through which inefficiency costs induced by global strategic interactions can be assessed. Our results emphasize the drastic change in the energy mix that will be necessary to control climate change, the huge investments in existing and new technologies implied, and the crucial role of breakthrough technological innovation.","Volume 31, Issue 2",May 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/2,40
"The clean development mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol may induce technological change in developing countries. As an alternative to the clean development mechanism regime, developing countries may accept a (generous) cap on their own emissions, allow domestic producers to invest in new efficient technologies, and sell the excess emission permits on the international permit market. The purpose of this article is to show how the gains from investment, and hence the incentive to invest in new technology in developing countries, differ between the two alternative regimes. We show that the difference in the gains from investment depends on whether the producers in developing countries face competitive or noncompetitive output markets, whether the investment affects fixed or variable production costs, and whether producers can reduce emissions through means other than investing in new technology.","Volume 31, Issue 1",January 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/31/issue/1,41
"It is well-known that unit-based pricing systems have a significant effect on the quantity of collected waste. Part of this effect may, however, result from a selection bias or environmental activism effect. Based on a pooled cross-section for the Netherlands for 1998–2005 we show that despite the correction for environmental activism the effect of the weight and bag unit-based pricing system on the quantity of waste is sizeable. Moreover, this environmental activism effect is decreasing over time, so that the most environmental friendly municipalities implement unit-based pricing systems at first. In addition, we show that the volume effects of the different unit-based pricing systems are rather stable over time. Although we find some evidence for a learning effect, nearly no evidence is found for an awareness erosion effect. This means at least that the effect of unit-based pricing does not decrease over time, which is reassuring from an environmental point of view.

The results indicate that hurdle rates of investment vary from 2.7 to 3.1 in the pulp and paper industry and from 3.4 to 3.6 in the energy and heating sector depending on econometric specification.","Volume 30, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/4,42
"Private agents make large contributions to networks of conserved land, but little is known about how private agents’ decisions might be altered by government actions. This paper explores the impact of public conservation and public policy on the quantity and configuration of private land conservation and the extent to which the social optimum is reached. Because land conservation benefits often have thresholds and spatial characteristics, we consider the impact of different land conservation benefit functions on the patterns of conservation created by the interaction of private and public agents. We find that public conservation crowds private conservation in or out depending on whether marginal conservation benefits increase or decrease with total acreage, and crowding out is mitigated by the presence of budget constraints. We show how land conservation agents might interact strategically in space depending on preferences over fragmentation, and we explore that spatial strategic interaction in a case with a regional land trust and a case with hot-spot parcels. We identify when government policies, such as agglomeration bonuses and mitigating coordination costs, are most likely to increase the social benefits provided by private land conservation agents.","Volume 30, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/4,42
"Corporate social responsibility can improve firms’ ability to recruit highly motivated employees. This can secure socially responsible firms’ survival even in a highly competitive environment. We show that if both socially responsible (green) and non-responsible (brown) firms exist in equilibrium, workers with high moral motivation, who shirk less than others, will self-select into the green firms. If unobservable effort is sufficiently important for firm productivity, this can drive every brown firm out of business—even in the case where many workers have no moral motivation whatsoever.","Volume 30, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/4,42
"We estimate a carbon mitigation cost curve for the U.S. commercial sector based on econometric estimation of the responsiveness of fuel demand and equipment choices to energy price changes. The model econometrically estimates fuel demand conditional on fuel choice, which is characterized by a multinomial logit model. Separate estimation of end uses (e.g., heating, cooking) using the U.S. Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey allows for exceptionally detailed estimation of price responsiveness disaggregated by end use and fuel type. We then construct aggregate long-run elasticities, by fuel type, through a series of simulations; own-price elasticities range from −0.9 for district heat services to −2.9 for fuel oil. The simulations form the basis of a marginal cost curve for carbon mitigation, which suggests that a price of $20 per ton of carbon would result in an 8% reduction in commercial carbon emissions, and a price of $100 per ton would result in a 28% reduction.","Volume 30, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/4,42
"We develop a stochastic endogenous growth model involving a non-renewable resource, in which innovation arrivals are governed by a non-stationary Poisson process. Using a CRRA analytical example, we characterize the optimal trajectories of the model and analyze the effects of uncertainty in the sense of Rothschild and Stiglitz by computing a mean-preserving spread. We show that increased variability in the innovation process always implies a smaller optimal R&D effort, since this leads to a reduced marginal rate of return. Effects on the other variables of the model may also be unambiguously identified depending upon the relative risk aversion of agents, the social discount rate and the marginal arrival rate of innovations. Finally, we investigate the conditions under which, on average, the economy reaches a sustainable growth path.","Volume 30, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/4,42
"This paper analyzes the multiple bounded format, in which uncertainty is directly incorporated into the WTP question. A new approach for analyzing multiple bounded uncertainty data is presented. The intuition underlying the approach is that uncertain individuals would like to state their WTP as intervals rather than precise values and that the width of the intervals is determined by the degree of uncertainty. The approach is compared to the one applied in Welsh and Poe [Welsh, M., Poe, G.L., 1998. Elicitation effects in contingent valuation: comparisons to a multiple bounded discrete choice approach. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management 36, 170–185] which treats uncertainty by conditioning responses on specific verbal probability statements. We argue that the conditioning approach overestimates mean and median WTP and that conditioning WTP estimates on probability statements like “probably” and “unsure” make them “fuzzy”. To empirically compare the two approaches we use data from 2004 concerning implementation of a predator protection policy in Sweden. Our analysis show that the suggested approach: (1) is more intuitive; (2) better fits the data; (3) estimates mean and median WTP with better precision; (4) is less sensitive to distributional assumptions; and (5) it is better suited for policy analysis.","Volume 30, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/4,42

"This article presents a combined economic–political model of environmental taxation setting. The model introduces a third lobby group – the lobby of an eco-industry – in addition to the traditional lobbies of polluting firms and environmentalists. Pressure groups interact to influence the environmental tax chosen by a regulator maximizing its chances of being reelected. The eco-industry lobby adds a new political contribution toward a higher environmental tax. The imperfectly competitive structure of the eco-industry also modifies the incentives of the usual lobbies. When the foreign environmental policy is constant, environmentalists can be in favor of a decrease in the local tax in order to reduce foreign pollution. We also discuss the formation of alliances between the eco-industry and one of the other lobbies and their potential impact. In general, the impact of lobbying activities on the politically optimal tax is ambiguous and depends on the relative concentration of each pressure group.","Volume 30, Issue 3",August 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/3,43
"This paper explores the relationship between interstate air pollution and the division of power between federal and state agencies in setting and enforcing standards. In the context of the US Clean Air Act we argue that the EPA is able to monitor the adoption of technology-based standards more closely than it can monitor state-level enforcement, and that this causes an effective division of control between federal and state agencies. Our analysis offers three main insights into the interstate pollution problem in this setting. First, states have an incentive to enforce standards less stringently on firms located close to downwind borders, and this leads to excessive interstate pollution in equilibrium. Second, there can arise an inherent substitutability in the regulatory problem between strict standards and compliance effort, and this creates a strategic linkage between the federal policy on standards and state policies on enforcement. In particular, a tighter federal standard can induce less selective enforcement but can also lead to less enforcement overall. Third, states will attempt to neutralize the impact of location-based federal standards (that specifically target interstate pollution) in a way that actually exacerbates the underlying enforcement problem.","Volume 30, Issue 3",August 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/3,43
"Using a vertically differentiated product model, this paper examines welfare implications of various government policies in a situation where consumers are environmentally discerning. It studies ad valorem taxes/subsidies and emission taxes. The optimal policy depends on the magnitude of damage parameter associated with environmental externality. For a given distribution of tastes and preferences, as the damage parameter increases from a low to a high value, the optimal policy shifts from an ad valorem tax to an ad valorem subsidy. It also shows that for a sufficiently low damage parameter, an ad valorem tax dominates an emission tax.","Volume 30, Issue 3",August 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/3,43
"The main purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between pollution and income at household level. The study is motivated by the recent literature emphasizing the importance of income distribution for the aggregate relation between pollution and income. The main findings from previous studies are that if the individual pollution–income relationship is non-linear, then aggregate pollution for, say, a whole country, will depend not only on average income, but also on how income is distributed. To achieve our objective we formulate a model for determining the choice of consumption of goods in different types of household. Furthermore we link the demand model to emission functions for various goods. The theoretical analysis shows that without imposing very restrictive assumptions on preferences and the emission functions, it is not possible to determine a priori the slope or the curvature of the pollution–income relation. The empirical analysis shows that, given the model used, the pollution–income relation has a positive slope in Sweden and is strictly concave for all three pollutants under study (CO2, SO2, NOx), at least in the neighbourhood of the observed income for an average household. We also show that altering the prevailing income distribution, holding average income constant, will affect aggregate emissions in the sense that an equalization of incomes will give rise to an increase in emissions. One implication is then that the development of aggregate pollution due to growth depends not only on the income level, but also on how growth is distributed.","Volume 30, Issue 3",August 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/3,43
"We discuss several major econometric problems that have been ignored in the empirical environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) literature thus far. These are: First, the use of nonlinear transformations of integrated regressors and second, in a panel context, cross-sectional dependence in the data. Both problems fundamentally invalidate the use of widely applied time series and panel unit root and cointegration techniques. We use the important special case of the relationship between GDP and CO2 (and SO2) emissions to show and discuss in detail that the seemingly strong evidence for an inverted U-shaped relationship between these variables obtained with commonly used methods is entirely spurious and vanishes when resorting to estimation strategies that take the discussed problems into account.","Volume 30, Issue 3",August 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/3,43

"This paper develops a theory of ‘oil’igopoly exploration of an exhaustible resource. Strategic exploration and production are jointly derived in a three period subgame perfect equilibrium. While the ‘oil’igopoly theory of exploration shares many features with non-strategic models of exploration and production, there is one important difference. The ‘oil’igopoly theory of exploration predicts that firms who exhaust their proved reserves before they can convert their unproved reserves into proved reserves have an incentive to over-explore, relative to the Nash equilibrium level of exploration. A simple empirical prediction is that firms holding smaller proved reserves should be observed doing more exploration. This prediction is consistent with country-level production and reserve data in the post-World War II era.","Volume 30, Issue 3",August 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/3,43
"Land ownership and control of development in new and frontier cities is often concentrated. Local public goods, such as wetlands and riparian habitats, can be adversely affected by development. Regulatory pressure to protect these local public goods may not emerge until after some development has occurred. When development rights are insecure, an incentive exists to accelerate early development, an incentive that increases with the number of firms. Further, multiple equilibria may exist, which can result in large increases in development for small increases in the number of firms. When firms are uncertain about how the regulator values the local public good, development may be further accelerated and there may be even more equilibria.","Volume 30, Issue 3",August 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/3,43
"Although ecosystems provide myriad services to economies, only one service is considered in most renewable-resource models. The general equilibrium bioeconomic model introduced here admits a second service, and more importantly it accounts for how the two services are impacted by interactions within an eight-species ecosystem and interactions within a regional economy. Endangered Steller sea lion recovery measures via alternative pollock quotas change all ecosystem populations and all economic variables. While non-use values associated with the ecosystem (e.g., existence values) are not considered, all species matter for the economy because they are all used indirectly as support for ecosystem services. Regional welfare changes from reduced quotas show the tradeoff between consumptive and non-consumptive uses of the ecosystem.","Volume 30, Issue 2",May 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/2,44
"Several recent papers propose competing theoretical explanations for the empirical observation of an inverted U-shape relationship between environmental degradation and per-capita income. We propose the following test of the theory: calibrate a theoretical model to an already developed economy using information unrelated to the pollution–income curve. Then simulate the model starting from a less developed initial condition and compare the predicted pollution–income relationship with that in the data. Our results are mixed. Some support exists for the theory that the inverted U-shape results from a corner solution in which less developed countries do not abate pollution. However, because we find abatement is relatively inexpensive, the model predicts pollution peaks at a level of per capita income much lower than that observed in our U.S. data. For some pollutants, we find evidence of a structural break in preferences in the early 1970s. When the structural break is added, the model performs better for two of three pollutants.","Volume 30, Issue 2",May 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/2,44
"Consumers are often uninformed, or unsure, about the ambient level of environmental risk. An optimal policy must jointly determine efficient levels of self-protection, information provision, and public risk mitigation efforts. Unfortunately, conventional welfare measures are not amenable to welfare analysis in the presence of imperfect information. We develop a theoretical welfare measure, called quasi-compensating variation, that is a natural extension of compensating variation (CV). We show that this welfare measure offers not only a money metric of the “value of information,” but also a means to appropriately evaluate the welfare effects of various policies when consumers are imperfectly informed about ambient risk. This welfare measure allows us to obtain a number of results that the traditional CV measure fails to offer. In particular, we show that the consumer’s willingness to pay for a (small) environmental risk reduction is higher for those who underestimate ambient risk than for those who overestimate or are perfectly informed if the marginal return to self-protection increases with ambient risk.","Volume 30, Issue 2",May 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/2,44
"This paper analyzes the effects of providing environmental amenities associated with open space in a discrete-space urban model and characterizes optimal provision of open space across a metropolitan area. The discrete-space model assumes distinct neighborhoods in which developable land is homogeneous within a neighborhood but heterogeneous across neighborhoods. Open space provides environmental amenities within the neighborhood it is located and may provide amenities in other neighborhoods (amenity spillover). We solve for equilibrium under various assumptions about amenity spillover effects and transportation costs in both open-city (with in- and out-migration) and closed-city (fixed population) versions of the model. Increasing open space tends to increase equilibrium housing density and price within a neighborhood. In an open-city model, open space provision also increases housing density and price in other neighborhoods if there is an amenity spillover effect. In a closed-city model, housing density and prices in other neighborhoods can decrease if the pull of the local amenity value is stronger than the push from reduced availability of developable land. We use numerical simulation to solve for the optimal pattern of open space in two examples: a simple symmetric case and a simulation based on the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, Minnesota, USA. With no amenity spillover, it is optimal to provide the same amount of open space in all neighborhoods regardless of transportation cost. With amenity spillover effects and relatively high transportation cost, it is optimal to provide open space in a greenbelt at the edge of the city. With low transportation cost, open space is provided throughout the city with the exception of neighborhoods on the periphery of the city, where the majority of the population lives. A greenbelt still occurs but its location is inside the city.","Volume 30, Issue 2",May 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/2,44
"We study an international climate agreement that assigns emission quotas to each participating country. Unlike the simplest models in the literature, we assume that abatement costs are affected by R&D activities undertaken in all firms in all countries, i.e. abatement technologies are endogenous. In line with the Kyoto agreement we assume that the international climate agreement does not include R&D policies. We show that for a second-best agreement with heterogeneous countries, marginal costs of abatement differ across countries. In other words, the second-best outcome cannot be achieved if emission quotas are tradable.","Volume 30, Issue 2",May 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/2,44

This paper analyzes the household decision to replant mangroves in four case study villages in Thailand in line with existing studies on the voluntary contribution to step-level public goods and the decision by adult members of a household to devote some labor to an outside activity. The null hypothesis that dependency on mangrove-based income has no influence on participation in replanting is rejected.

Evidence from Granger causality tests and common features analysis over the period from December 1994 to September 1999 indicates a moderate degree of integration among these markets. However, price effects throughout the region were often only unidirectional, did not exhibit the characteristics of perfect substitutability, and were significantly influenced by institutional changes in the California market.

"This paper introduces a solution for the fair division of emission reduction costs in the climate change regime. Our primary focus is on the fair division of efficiency gains that arise from exchanging the initial allocation of emission entitlements, rather than the initial allocation itself. We propose to complement the competitive Walrasian solution with welfare bounds, the ethical justification of which rests on commonality of ownership. Simulations with an intertemporal computable general equilibrium model illustrate the relevance of such welfare bounds. For a wide range of initial allocations of emission entitlements – including an equal per capita allocation – we find that developing countries should be fully compensated for their emission abatement efforts, but should not receive any further transfers.","Volume 30, Issue 2",May 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/2,44
"This paper describes a world composed of two (groups of) countries, which derive their utility from a polluting activity and from the enjoyment of a common environmental quality. The initial situation is both suboptimal and unsustainable: pollution leads to a continuous deterioration of environmental quality. The two countries have heterogeneous preferences for the environment, which are private knowledge. This prevents the adoption of abatement policies negotiated between the two countries, because each one has a strong incentive to announce in every negotiation an arbitrarily low preference for the environment. The two countries then engage in a war of attrition, each of them postponing abatement policies, in the hope that the other will concede first and abate more. We study for how long the adjustment is postponed, according to initial conditions, the greenness of the greenest country, the possible range of preferences and the rates of discount and natural regeneration.","Volume 30, Issue 2",May 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/2,44

"This paper reconciles conflicting explanations for the decline in U.S. energy intensity over the last 40 years of the 20th century. Decomposing changes in the energy–GDP ratio into shifts in the structure of sectoral composition and adjustments in the efficiency of energy use within individual industries reveals that while inter-industry structural change was the principal driver of the observed decline in aggregate energy intensity, intra-industry efficiency improvements played a more important role in the post-1980 period. Econometric results attribute this phenomenon to adjustments in quasi-fixed inputs—particularly vehicle stocks, and disembodied autonomous technological progress, and show that price-induced substitution of variable inputs generated transitory energy savings, while innovation induced by energy prices had only a minor impact.","Volume 30, Issue 1",January 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/1,45
"This paper applies the most recently developed panel unit root, heterogeneous panel cointegration and panel-based error correction models to re-investigate co-movement and the causal relationship between energy consumption and real GDP within a multivariate framework that includes capital stock and labor input for 16 Asian countries during the 1971–2002 period. It employs the production side model (aggregate production function). The empirical results fully support a positive long-run cointegrated relationship between real GDP and energy consumption when the heterogeneous country effect is taken into account. It is found that although economic growth and energy consumption lack short-run causality, there is long-run unidirectional causality running from energy consumption to economic growth. This means that reducing energy consumption does not adversely affect GDP in the short-run but would in the long-run; thus, these countries should adopt a more vigorous energy policy. Furthermore, we broaden the investigation by dividing the sample countries into two cross-regional groups, namely the APEC and ASEAN groups, and even more important results and implications emerge.","Volume 30, Issue 1",January 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/30/issue/1,45

"The most persistently troubling empirical result in the contingent valuation method literature is the tendency for hypothetical willingness to pay to overestimate real willingness to pay. Two approaches, ex-ante and ex-post, have been developed to mitigate or eliminate the overstatement of hypothetical willingness to pay. The ex-ante approach addresses hypothetical bias in the survey design stage while the ex-post approach addresses hypothetical bias with follow-up questions to the hypothetical willingness to pay question. We find that willingness to pay estimates are similar when either the ex-ante or ex-post approach are employed. Our results suggest that the approaches should be considered as complements and not substitutes.

"A potentially serious environmental threat facing humanity is the possibility of a collapse of the thermohaline circulation. Resulting climate changes, including absolute cooling near Greenland and northwest Europe, could be abrupt. Collapse of the thermohaline circulation may be triggered if the temperature or the rate of temperature change exceeds certain thresholds. The locations of these thresholds are unknown. Economic regulation of this problem requires solution methods for a class of dynamic optimization problems with multiple thresholds located in n-dimensional space.

"This paper investigates the link between trade and environment by exploring the effects of green tariffs on innovation, location of production and the environment. It shows that tariffs levied on polluting goods could result in less world pollution than global harmonization of environmental standards by inducing more pollution-abatement R&D effort and generating lower unit emissions from production. Specifically, green tariffs reduce pollution by (1) shifting production to the region where environmental standards are respected, (2) inducing the firm in the clean country to engage in more abatement R&D by granting it a higher market power/share in its home market, (3) instigating green R&D investment by deterring delocation. When these outweigh the R&D-creating effect of environmental harmonization in the dirty country, green tariffs bring about a cleaner environment.","Volume 29, Issue 4",November 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/29/issue/4,46

"Two recent stated preference studies include questions that explore participants’ beliefs regarding the cost amount stated in the valuation question in relation to the cost to them if the project were implemented. Results from these studies suggest that a significant proportion of people do not believe these stated cost amounts. This paper explores the implications of participants answering valuation questions that are not consistent with their beliefs regarding stated costs. As an example, the paper develops a response model for dichotomous choice stated preference questions. Participants gather project information through the stated preference experiment, form a prior distribution of costs, update the distribution of costs based on a survey's stated cost and then respond to the dichotomous choice stated preference question. The model suggests that participants will not generally respond truthfully in the sense that they may say no to a stated cost that is less than their willingness to pay for a project or yes to a stated cost that is more than their willingness to pay. While the model findings suggest potentially serious problems with stated preference estimation, the observed patterns of disbelief from the empirical studies result in downwardly biased estimates of mean willingness to pay.","Volume 29, Issue 3",September 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/29/issue/3,47
"The literature estimating the economic value for water quality changes has grown considerably over the last 30 years, resulting in an expanded pool of information potentially available to support national and regional policy analysis. Using 131 willingness to pay estimates from 18 studies that use a similar definition of water quality, we performed a meta-regression analysis and found mixed results. We find that WTP varies in systematic and expected ways with respect to factors such as the size of the water quality changes, average household income, and use/nonuse characteristics of respondents. As a whole, we conclude that our meta-regression results provide a reasonable basis for estimating expected WTP values for defined changes in water quality. However, despite a large number of existing economic valuation studies, relatively few could be meaningfully combined through meta-analysis due to heterogeneity in the commodities being valued in the original studies. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations for future research, including suggestions regarding more standardized approaches for defining water quality and reporting information in valuation studies.","Volume 29, Issue 3",September 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/29/issue/3,47
"This study investigates how access to political endorsements affects stated preferences for an environmental public good in Switzerland. We developed a contingent valuation survey questionnaire with two valuation questions, the first formulated as a (hypothetical) policy referendum, the second an open-ended WTP question. For the referendum question we solicited endorsements from a range of political parties and relevant interest groups. We then conducted a split-sample mail-survey experiment in which a table listing the endorsements was included with a subsample of the questionnaires. Access to the policy endorsements significantly affected the responses to the open-ended willingness-to-pay question.","Volume 29, Issue 3",September 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/29/issue/3,47
"Political pressure often exists for rebating environmental levies, particularly when incomplete regulatory coverage allegedly creates an “unlevel playing field” with other, unregulated firms or industries. This paper assesses the conditions under which rebating environmental levies is justified for the regulated sector, combining a theoretical approach with numerical simulations parameterized to reflect the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Rebates are undesired if one can instead tax the production of the unregulated sector. Otherwise, rebating is justified only when the goods of the competing sectors are close substitutes with similar emissions profiles.

As opposed to the few previous micro (cross-section) data studies we find that both electricity and other energy are complements with capital. Substitution between electricity and other energy is limited. The own-price elasticity for electricity is −0.21 in the translog model and −0.19 in the linear logit model. The corresponding own-price elasticities are −0.45 and −0.23 for other energy, −0.08 and −0.05 for labour and −0.45 and −0.34 for capital.","Volume 29, Issue 2",May 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/29/issue/2,48

If the target level of atmospheric CO2 concentration can be achieved in spite of delay, several factors suggest economic benefits to a delay strategy. However, the analyses that lead to these conclusions typically ignore or underestimate the significant heterogeneity in the turnover rate of society's capital stock. This research explores the relationship between the turnover rate of capital stocks and the delay decision using a model and empirically estimated abatement costs.

"We examine the conditions for the sustainability of a production–consumption system based on the use of an exhaustible natural resource. Instead of studying the environmental and economic interactions in terms of optimal control, we focus on the viability of the system, defined by a set of constraints combining guaranteed consumption and a stock of resources to be preserved at all times, which refers to a Rawlsian intergenerational equity perspective. Using the mathematical concept of viability kernel, which makes it possible to deal with the consistency between constraints and controlled dynamics, we exhibit the sustainable technological configurations and, whenever possible, the policy options and environmental-economic states required to obtain a perennial system. We point out the flexibility of the sustainable “extraction–consumption” choices and we show how they are neither reduced to constant consumption paths nor to Hartwick’s rule.

"This paper analyses how tradable emission permits should be allocated to firms when capital is internationally mobile. When international environmental problems are attempted solved through uncoordinated policies between countries, it might be desirable for the home country to issue free emission permits in proportion to the use of capital in order to prevent leakage through international capital movements. The desirability of free emission permits will however be reduced if capital also can be employed in a domestic non-polluting sector. In this case, it may even be optimal to tax the use of capital in the polluting sector. It is also shown that it is always optimal to subsidise the use of capital in the polluting sector if the use of labour is taxed at an optimal rate. Finally, leakage does not affect the optimal domestic emission limit as long as appropriate capital subsidies and labour taxes are implementeed.","Volume 29, Issue 1",January 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/29/issue/1,49

The optimal subsidy rate of a carbon-free technology is high when the technology is first adopted, but falls significantly over the next decades. However, the efficiency costs of uniform instead of optimal subsidies, may be low if there are adjustment costs for a new technology. Finally, supporting existing energy technologies only, may lead to technology lock-in, and the impacts of lock-in increase with the learning potential of new technologies as well as the possibilities for early entry.","Volume 29, Issue 1",January 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/29/issue/1,49

The empirical findings in the paper show that the pollution control expenditures have a positive relationship with the R&D expenditures and have a negative relationship with the average age of capital stock.

"Much of the existing literature on air pollution and mortality deals only with the short-term effects of air pollution. Policy on the other hand needs to know when, whether and to what extent pollution-induced increases in mortality counts are reversed. This involves modelling the entire infinite distributed-lag effect of air pollution on mortality counts.Using an ARMAX modelling strategy this paper illustrates how distributed lag effects can be parsimoniously but plausibly estimated in the context of a time-series study into the relationship between ambient levels of air pollution and daily mortality counts for Manchester. The analysis reveals that maximum 1-h ozone levels are strongly associated with daily mortality counts and that a significant harvesting effect is present. The mortality cost of peak 1-h ozone concentrations for Greater Manchester with a population of 2.6 million is estimated to be £572 million annually. This accounts for the fact that some of the deaths associated with maximum 1-h O3 concentrations have been advanced only by a short period of time.","Volume 28, Issue 4",November 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/28/issue/4,50
"This paper studies the influence of free trade agreements on national environmental policies and location strategies of polluting firms. It is shown that banning export subsidies makes relocation of production more attractive for firms. When export subsidies are banned relocation is profitable because: (1) the rival firm reduces output due to more stringent emission regulation in the host country of the investment and (2) relocation leads to lower emission tax rate in the original home country of the investing firm. When export subsidies are used, the first effect is absent because the host government is able to use the export subsidy to compensate the negative effect of more stringent emission taxation on domestic shareholders.","Volume 28, Issue 4",November 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/28/issue/4,50
"“Green” consumers appear to accept individual responsibility for the provision of public goods. The propensity to take such responsibility may depend on beliefs about others’ behavior, even for consumers motivated by internalized moral norms, not by social sanctions. This effect can produce multiple equilibria with either high or low demand for “green” products. Permanent increases in green consumption may be achieved by imposing temporary taxes or subsidies, or through advertising that influences beliefs about others’ behavior or about external effects. If a tax is interpreted as taking responsibility away from the individual, however, taxes can reduce the influence of moral motivation.","Volume 28, Issue 4",November 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/28/issue/4,50

The values in states H and I, VSL(H) and VSL(I), are derived from two Bellman dynamic programming equations. The individual's valuation of (small) instantaneous environmental changes, and of permanent environmental changes (“environmental investments”), are shown to depend on both VSL(H) and VSL(I), for each of the states H and I. We show that VSL(I) may exceed VSL(H), and the value of environmental improvements in the ill state may exceed those in the healthy state, in particular for short-lasting illness and when the marginal value of consumption is lower in state I than in state H.","Volume 28, Issue 3, Pages 193-298 (August 2006)",August 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/28/issue/3,51

Research on time preferences and discounting has two main motivations: to inform decision making by providing a basis for the comparison of future costs and benefits; to explain the influence of the future on current behaviour. This paper introduces the wide range of discount functions which have been advocated in addition to the standard constant rate exponential model. The different approaches taken to estimating the parameters of the discount function are reviewed. The issues raised by discounting in the longer term are discussed. Particular attention is given to time preferences with respect to future health events which have for a number of reasons been a fruitful area for research on time preferences. Specifically the paper examines: the distinctive issues raised when discounting future health events; the methods which have been used to discount health events; the relationship between time preferences and health-affecting behaviour.,"Volume 28, Issue 3, Pages 193-298 (August 2006)",August 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/28/issue/3,51
"This paper investigates how irreversibilities affect the optimal intertemporal accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere under uncertainty. More precisely, the evolution of the future temperature is assumed to follow an Itô-process with the drift provided by greenhouse gas emissions. This paper considers two different kinds of irreversibilities: of emissions (i.e., CO2 once dissolved into the air cannot be collected later) and of stopping. These issues are investigated first (in the tradition of the real option literature) as pure stopping problems and then allowing for a continuous choice of emissions. Implications for global warming are: an irreversible stopping of greenhouse gas emissions is never optimal in a continuous framework and yields in the real option framework a less conservationist stopping rule in which uncertainty increases the stopping threshold (i.e. works against conservation).","Volume 28, Issue 2",May 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/28/issue/2,52

More recently, economic DEA methods have been developed that incorporate the costs and benefits of increasing capacity utilisation. One such method was applied to estimate the capacity utilisation and output of the Scottish fleet. By comparing the results of the economic and traditional DEA approaches, it can be concluded that many fleet segments are operating at or close to full capacity, and that the vessels defining the frontier are operating consistent with profit maximising behaviour.","Volume 28, Issue 2",May 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/28/issue/2,52
"Many studies have shown that the activities of multinational corporations are quite sensitive to differences in income tax rates across countries. In this paper I explore the interaction between multinational taxation and abatement activities under an international emissions permit trading scheme. Four types of plans are considered: (1) a single domestic permit system with international offsets; (2) separate national permit systems without trade; (3) separate national permit systems with limited offsets; and (4) an international permit trading system. For each plan, I model the incentives for the multinational firm to choose abatement activities at home and abroad and to transfer emissions credits between parent and subsidiary. Limits on trading across countries restrict efficiency gains from abatement, as is well known. But if available offset opportunities are limited to actual abatement activities, those activities are also more susceptible to distortions from incentives to shift taxable income. Transfer-pricing rules can limit but not always eliminate these distortions. In a system of unlimited international trading, abatement is efficiently allocated across countries, but tax shifting can still be achieved through intra-firm transfer pricing. From the basis of efficiency for both environmental and tax policies, the best design is an international permit trading system with transparent, enforceable transfer-pricing rules.","Volume 28, Issue 2",May 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/28/issue/2,52
"This paper determines a firm’s profit-maximizing R&D response to an uncertain carbon tax, for two different R&D programs: cost reduction of low carbon energy technologies and emissions reductions of currently economic technologies. We find that optimal R&D does not increase monotonically in a carbon tax. R&D into alternative technologies increases only if the firm is flexible enough; R&D into conventional technologies first increases then decreases in a carbon tax. Firms that are very flexible may increase R&D into alternative technologies when the uncertainty surrounding a carbon tax is increased; otherwise firms will generally decrease R&D investment in uncertainty.","Volume 28, Issue 2",May 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/28/issue/2,52

Three effects of banking are identified: externality effect, information effect, and total permit effect. In the absence of total permit effect, banking is welfare improving if information effect is positive and dominates the externality effect.

"The paper studies the dynamic allocation effects and intergenerational welfare consequences of environmental taxes. To this end, environmental externalities are introduced in a Blanchard–Yaari overlapping generations model of a small open economy. A rise in environmental taxes – taking into account pre-existing distortionary taxes and endogenous labor supply – is shown to yield an efficiency gain if agents care enough for the environment. The benefits are unevenly distributed across generations because agents are heterogeneous in their capital ownership. An accompanying debt policy can be designed – prescribing debt accumulation at impact and debt redemption in the new steady state – to ensure everybody gains to the same extent. With lump-sum recycling of environmental tax revenue, aggregate employment is unaffected in the short run, but falls in the long run. Furthermore, it raises environmental quality more in the long run than in the short run. Recycling revenue through a cut in labor taxes, however, is shown to yield a rise in employment in the short run, which disappears during transition. In the new steady state, environmental quality is higher at the expense of a lower level of employment.","Volume 28, Issue 1",January 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/28/issue/1,53

"Environmental policies often set “relative” or “intensity” emission caps, i.e. emission limits proportional to the polluting firm's output. One of the arguments put forth in favour of relative caps is based on the uncertainty on business-as-usual output: if the firm's production level is higher than expected, so will be business-as-usual emissions, hence reaching a given level of emissions will be more costly than expected. As a consequence, it is argued, a higher emission level should be allowed if the production level is more important than expected. We assess this argument with a stochastic analytical model featuring two random variables: the business-as-usual emission level, proportional to output, and the slope of the marginal abatement cost curve. We compare the relative cap to an absolute cap and to a price instrument, in terms of welfare impact. It turns out that in most plausible cases, either a price instrument or an absolute cap yields a higher expected welfare than a relative cap. Quantitatively, the difference in expected welfare is typically very small between the absolute and the relative cap but may be significant between the relative cap and the price instrument.","Volume 27, Issue 4",November 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/27/issue/4,54

The results also suggest that the performance system standard could be better than a permit-trading system at avoiding carbon leakage.

The option value of waiting can justify putting off, possibly indefinitely, what would otherwise be a sound investment in current backstop technology. In other circumstances the resource is depleted more rapidly and adoption occurs sooner than if future discoveries were not anticipated.","Volume 27, Issue 2",June 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/27/issue/2,56
"We analyze the impact of the pollution generated by the use of non-renewable resources on the standard results of growth models. In this context, we obtain a Hotelling rule which is not a pure efficiency condition any longer. Subsequently, we show that some of the optimal paths’ standard properties change: in particular, an increase in the households’ psychological discount rate leads to a slower extraction of the resource. Moreover, we present a simple endogenous growth model that allows us to study the effects of an environmental policy aimed at correcting the distortion introduced at the equilibrium. We show that the tax level does not matter, and that a decreasing tax on the resource use yields the optimum.","Volume 27, Issue 2",June 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/27/issue/2,56
"In this paper we use directional technology distance functions to evaluate the impact of environmental regulations on firms’ performance. Following Färe et al. [Färe, R., Grosskopf, S., Lovell, C.A.K., Pasurka, C., 1989. Multilateral productivity comparisons when some outputs are undesirable: a nonparametric approach. The Review of Economics and Statistics 71, 90–98.], we construct an index that measures opportunity costs for individual firms arising from regulations that prevent free disposal of wastes. The methodology is applied to a sample of Spanish producers of ceramic pavements. We assume that firms maximise desirable output simultaneously reducing inputs, with no change in the production of bad outputs. Our results show that when firms face environmental rules preventing free disposal of bads, their potential to increase desirable output by behaving efficiently is largely affected. We also find that large firms show smaller regulation costs.","Volume 27, Issue 2",June 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/27/issue/2,56
In order to incorporate behavioral change in the willingness to pay model we jointly estimate contingent valuation and revealed and contingent behavior data. The willingness to pay model includes the change in the number of recreation trips as an independent variable. Models that do not account for the endogeneity of trips produce inconsistent coefficient estimates. Accounting for the endogeneity of the change in trips in both independent and jointly estimated models of willingness to pay and behavior leads to an increase in the ratio of use value to total value.,"Volume 27, Issue 2",June 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/27/issue/2,56
"The focus of this paper is on how to model and solve an environmental compliance problem using [Rosen, J.B., 1965. Existence and uniqueness of equilibrium points for concave n-person games. Econometrica 33 (3), 520–534] seminal idea of coupled constraint equilibrium. First, Rosen's results about the existence and uniqueness of a Nash normalised equilibrium for coupled constraint games are explained. These results are then combined with a numerical approach to game solutions based on the Nikaido–Isoda function. A river basin pollution game, which is a model for a common nonpoint source pollution problem, is solved numerically using this approach. In the game, the agents face a joint constraint on the total pollution, which defines a coupled constraint set in the combined strategy space. This makes the game special in terms of the strategy spaces. Unlike for standard games where they are defined separately for each player, here we have a joint constraint on the combined strategy space of all players. Hence, the game needs coupled constraint equilibrium as the solution concept. Static and (open-loop) dynamic equilibria are computed for the basin problem under the discussed equilibrium concept. All equilibria are instructive for the legislator, in that they contain information on how to choose the “optimal” charges, under which agents obey the constraints.","Volume 27, Issue 2",June 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/27/issue/2,56
"The economic impact of climate change is usually measured as the extent to which the climate of a given period affects social welfare in that period. This static approach ignores the dynamic effects through which climate change may affect economic growth and hence future welfare. In this paper we take a closer look at these dynamic effects, in particular saving and capital accumulation. With a constant savings rate, a lower output due to climate change will lead to a proportionate reduction in investment which in turn will depress future production (capital accumulation effect) and, in almost all cases, future consumption per capita. If the savings rate is endogenous, forward looking agents would change their savings behavior to accommodate the impact of future climate change. This suppresses growth prospects in absolute and per capita terms (savings effect). In an endogenous growth context, these two effects may be exacerbated through changes in labour productivity and the rate of technical progress. Simulations using a simple climate-economy model suggest that the capital accumulation effect is important, especially if technological change is endogenous, and may be larger than the direct impact of climate change. The savings effect is less pronounced. The dynamic effects are more important, relative to the direct effects, if climate change impacts are moderate overall. This suggests that they are more of a concern in developed countries, which are believed to be less vulnerable to climate change. The magnitude of dynamic effects is not sensitive to the choice of discount rate.","Volume 27, Issue 1",January 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/27/issue/1,57
"Global climate change is rife with uncertainties. Yet, we can expect to resolve much of this uncertainty in the next 100 years or so. Therefore, current actions should reflect the value of flexibility. Nevertheless, most models of climate change, particularly game-theoretic models, abstract from uncertainty.

"We show that the social desirability of a resource substitute systematically depends on the pattern of resources—either renewable (RR) or non-renewable (NRR)—involved in the resource substitute development program. Developing a RR in an NRR-based economy is particularly rewarding because the part of the NRR stock, which would be consumed in the absence of the RR substitute, provides funding for the development program. A RR-based economy is more demanding than a NRR-based one because (i) it feels richer since its consumption is not doomed to decline, and (ii) its sacrifice, in terms of foregone consumption during the investment phase, cannot be managed and reduced with the same flexibility as in a NRR-based economy, which is freer in shifting resource use across time. Thus the larger the willingness to smooth consumption, the greater is the investment in the NRR-based economy, the smaller in the RR-based one.","Volume 27, Issue 1",January 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/27/issue/1,57

"Tyteca [J. Environ. Manage. 46 (1996) 281] reviews the literature on environmental performance indicators. In that paper he calls for an index that simultaneously accounts for resources used, good outputs produced and pollutants or undesirable outputs emitted. Here, we provide a formal index number of environmental performance which can be computed using data envelopment analysis (DEA) techniques. The implicit benchmark is that of finding the highest ratio of good to bad outputs. Our environmental performance index is constructed from distance functions which implies that it satisfies a number of desirable properties. Since the component distance functions require only information on input and output quantities, the fact that bad outputs typically are not marketed and therefore have no readily observable ‘price’ poses no obstacle.

Unit-based pricing is shown to be effective in reducing unsorted and compostable waste and in stimulating recyclable waste. If the estimations are corrected for differences in environmental activism between municipalities the effects are still large but significantly lower. The bag- and weight-based systems perform equally and far better compared with the frequency- and volume-based systems. This is interesting, as administrative costs are significantly lower for the bag-based system. Finally, unit-based pricing has no effect on the amounts of waste collected in surrounding municipalities.","Volume 26, Issue 4",December 2004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/26/issue/4,58

We show that imposing environmental liability only on polluting firms, with limited liability, increases use of bank debt. Extending environmental liability to banks lowers bank borrowing relative to liability only on firms, with an ambiguous effect relative to no liability. Using US industry-level data we estimate a reduced-form model of bank borrowing by firms and show that the introduction of environmental liability only on firms increased bank borrowing by 15–20%, but when liability was extended to banks, borrowing returned to a level slightly higher than with no liability.","Volume 26, Issue 4",December 2004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/26/issue/4,58

We examine if a little dose of such idealistic behavior has a large impact on the market equilibrium, and to what extent it can replace the environmental regulation. The analysis is carried out in a model with product differentiation, where consumers differ in their preferences for product quality. Consumers’ willingness to pay the environmental premium may be uniformly or non-uniformly distributed. Green consumerism will only be modestly influential in both cases, despite the fact that product differentiation leads to relaxed competition and increased profits, and thereby creates leverage.","Volume 26, Issue 3",September 2004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/26/issue/3,59
"Little effort has been devoted to determining the cost-effective trading region for emission permits that achieve an ambient standard. With regional expansion, control by more distant, lower marginal cost sources supplants control by higher marginal cost sources in the original region. However, the impact of more distant source emissions on ambient receptors will typically decline. The aggregate effect on costs of this tradeoff depends crucially on the standard’s stringency. Since a rule-of-thumb for the effect of regional expansion requires overly-restrictive assumptions, we model nitrogen oxide permits subject to nitrogen loading standards for Chesapeake Bay. Regional expansion substantially reduces cost only when the standard is stringent.","Volume 26, Issue 3",September 2004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/26/issue/3,59

Efficient fees are found by comparing incremental benefits with emission fee levels. National quantity caps that are equivalent to these fees also are computed, and found to approximate caps under consideration in the current multi-pollutant debate in the US Congress and the recent proposals from the Bush administration for the electricity industry.

In particular, in the phylogenetic tree model the diversity of any set of species can be recursively determined from the pairwise dissimilarities between them. The restrictions imposed by the phylogenetic tree model on the underlying dissimilarity metric are characterized and shown to be weaker than those entailed by the cladistic model. An especially parsimonous version of the phylogenetic tree model is obtained by invoking an appropriate notion of translation invariance.","Volume 26, Issue 2",June 2004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/26/issue/2,60
"An index of ‘deforestation pressure’ is suggested as useful for reserve planning alongside the currently used information on the species present at candidate sites. For any location, the index value is correlated with threats to habitat and thus also survival probabilities over time for members of species dependent on that habitat. Threats in the absence of reserves are key information for planning new reserves. The index is estimated using a regression approach derived from a dynamic, micro-economic model of land use, with data on observed clearing of forest over space and time as well as biophysical and socioeconomic factors in land returns. Applying an estimated threat (or probability of clearing) function for Costa Rica to locations of interest yields relevant estimates of sites’ deforestation pressure, which are used to evaluate proposed reserves and to suggest other candidate sites.","Volume 26, Issue 2",June 2004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/26/issue/2,60

Using fixed effects logit estimation, we find that adoption rates are higher for projects with shorter paybacks, lower costs, greater annual savings, higher energy prices, and greater energy conservation. Plants are 40% more responsive to initial costs than annual savings, suggesting that subsidies may be more effective at promoting energy-efficient technologies than energy price increases. Adoption decisions imply hurdle rates of 50–100%, which is consistent with the investment criteria small and medium-size firms state they use.","Volume 26, Issue 1",March 2004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/26/issue/1,61
"Energy costs are included in the rent for many US apartments, giving tenants little incentive to conserve. This apparent market failure has two explanations: the tenants value the utility-included rental contracts more than they value the extra energy they consume, or the landlords value the contracts more than the cost of that extra energy. We use the Residential Energy Consumption Survey and the American Housing Survey to estimate energy consumption and rent premiums for utility-included apartments. While rents are higher than for comparable metered apartments, the difference is smaller than the cost of the energy used, a finding that supports landlord-side explanations.","Volume 26, Issue 1",March 2004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/26/issue/1,61
"While energy intensity in China has fallen almost continuously since the onset of economic reform in the late 1970s, beginning in 1996 the data show a striking decline in China’s absolute level of energy use.

In order to investigate this energy puzzle, this paper employs a unique set of panel data for approximately 2500 of China’s most energy intensive large and medium-sized industrial enterprises during 1997–1999. Rising relative energy prices, research and development expenditures, and ownership reform in the enterprise sector, as well as shifts in China’s industrial structure, emerge as the principal drivers of China’s declining energy intensity and use.","Volume 26, Issue 1",March 2004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/26/issue/1,61

This “more is less” result emphasizes that setting a corrective tax that ignores the flow externality, or imposing a corrective tax at too low a level where there exists only a stock externality, may affect both transitory and steady-state output, tax payments and cumulative emissions.

There is one firm in each jurisdiction, and both firms threaten to relocate their production to the other jurisdiction. Because there is asymmetric information about the cost of relocation, the governments do not know the credibility of the threat.We compare the outcome of this game with the outcome of a game in which relocation is not possible. We find that the threat of relocation can increase both the level of environmental regulation and welfare. The profit tax level proves to be the most decisive for the result; that is, the higher the profit tax level, the lower the level of environmental regulation.","Volume 25, Issue 2",May 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/25/issue/2,64
"A basic assumption of the hedonic technique is that there are no barriers to mobility that prevent prices changing to reflect the net benefits of a given location. But climate variables are undeviating over relatively large distances and the absence of a common language coupled with the existence of political boundaries may prevent the net advantages associated with a particular region from being eliminated. Apart from in a handful of countries, methods alternative to the hedonic approach may therefore be required to estimate the amenity value of climate. Adopting the household production function approach this paper undertakes a systematic examination of the role played by climate in determining consumption patters using data from 88 different countries. Given certain assumptions the paper then proceeds to calculate the constant utility change in the cost of living for a 2.5 °C increase in globally averaged mean temperature.

"This paper considers location decisions of a monopolist, who faces a tax on its emissions in the home country, under ex post that is, time consistent, and ex ante, that is precommitment, environmental policies. We show that the monopolist will relocate more often under ex post optimal emission taxes. A government which cannot commit to an ex ante emission tax and sets its tax ex post after abatement effort has been chosen, is unable to affect the monopolist’s location decision, because it cannot commit to strategically reduce its tax level in the first stage. Domestic welfare is often higher under ex post emission taxes whenever the monopolist relocates under both policy regimes. Otherwise, welfare is higher under government commitment to an ex ante emission tax level.

Both the output production technology and the emission–output ratio depend upon a stock of knowledge, which accumulates through R&D activities. Two versions of this model are studied, one with endogenous technical change but exogenous environmental technical change and the other with both endogenous and induced technical change. A third version also captures technological spillover effects. As an application, the model is simulated allowing for trade of pollution permits as specified in the Kyoto Protocol and assessing the implications in terms of cost efficiency, economic growth and R&D efforts of the three different specifications of technical change.","Volume 25, Issue 1",February 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/25/issue/1,65
"This paper analyzes the macro-economic costs and effects on consumption and energy demand of limiting the global average atmospheric temperature increase to 2 °C. We use a macro-economic model in which there are two competing energy technologies (carbon and non-carbon, respectively), technological change is represented endogenously, and energy is aggregated through a CES function implying positive demand for the relatively expensive non-carbon technology. Technological change is represented through a learning curve describing decreasing energy production costs as a function of cumulative experience. We find that energy savings constitutes an important mechanism for decreasing abatement costs in the short- and medium-term, while the acquisition of additional learning experience substantially decreases abatement costs in the longer-term.","Volume 25, Issue 1",February 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/25/issue/1,65
"We present a model of growth driven by energy use and endogenous factor-augmenting technological change. Both the rate and direction of technological progress are endogenous. The model captures four main stylised facts: total energy use has increased; energy use per hour worked increased slightly; energy efficiency has improved; and the value share of energy in GDP has steadily fallen. We study how energy conservation policies affect growth over time and in the long run. Policies that reduce the level of energy use are distinguished from those that reduce the growth rate of energy inputs. Although these policies may stimulate innovation, they unambiguously depress output levels. The former policy has no impact on long-run growth; the latter reduces long-run growth both in the short run and in the long run.","Volume 25, Issue 1",February 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/25/issue/1,65
"In this paper, we extend the Romer [Journal of Political Economy 98 (Part 2) (1990) S271] model in two ways. First we include energy consumption of intermediates. Second, intermediates become heterogeneous due to endogenous energy-saving technical change. We show that the resulting model can still generate steady state growth, but the growth rate depends negatively on the growth of real energy prices. The reason is that real energy price rises will lower the profitability of using new intermediate goods, and hence, the profitability of doing research, and therefore have a negative impact on growth. We also show that the introduction of an energy tax that is recycled in the form of an R&D subsidy may increase growth. We conclude that in order to have energy efficiency growth and output growth under rising real energy prices, a combination of R&D and energy policy is called for.","Volume 25, Issue 1",February 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/25/issue/1,65
"This paper studies the adoption and diffusion of energy-saving technologies in a vintage model. An important characteristic of the model is that vintages are complementary: there are returns to diversity of using a mix of vintages. We analyse how diffusion patterns and adoption behaviour are affected by complementarity and learning-by-using. It is shown that the stronger the complementarity between different vintages and the stronger the learning-by-using, the longer it takes before firms scrap old vintages. We argue that this is a relevant part of the explanation for the observed slow diffusion of energy-saving technologies. Finally, we show that an energy price tax reduces energy consumption, because it speeds up the diffusion of new energy-saving technologies and induces substitution from capital to labour.","Volume 25, Issue 1",February 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/25/issue/1,65
"This paper treats illegal landings and discards of fish as a moral hazard problem that arises from individual catches that are unobservable to society, and hence are private information. A tax/subsidy mechanism taking into account the asymmetric information problem is formulated as a solution to problems of illegal landings and discards. The incentive scheme uses fish stock size as the tax variable, and can be seen as an alternative to a control policy. Rough estimates from a simulation study suggest that the incentive scheme is potentially useful.","Volume 24, Issue 4",1 November 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/24/issue/4,66
"The empirical relevance of Hotelling’s exhaustible resource theory has been tested with primarily negative results. Tests have been performed on various resources, at different levels of aggregation, with varying market structures, and over different time periods. Consequently, it is difficult to draw any general conclusions concerning the theory’s applicability in explaining producer behavior, given the assumptions and restrictions implicit in the data and tests. This paper compares test results when the implicit restrictions associated with the data are removed. Employing a single data set we compare the results for four published tests. Even with this uniform data set, two approaches reject the theory while two do not.","Volume 24, Issue 4",1 November 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/24/issue/4,66
"We extend an analytical general equilibrium model of environmental policy with pre-existing labor tax distortions to include pre-existing monopoly power as well. We show that the existence of monopoly power has two offsetting effects on welfare. First, the environmental policy reduces monopoly profits, and the negative effect on income increases labor supply in a way that partially offsets the pre-existing labor supply distortion. Second, environmental policy raises prices, so interaction with the pre-existing monopoly distortion further exacerbates the labor supply distortion. This second effect is larger, for reasonable parameter values, so the existence of monopoly reduces the welfare gain (or increases the loss) from environmental restrictions.","Volume 24, Issue 4",1 November 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/24/issue/4,66
"Optimal marginal investment incentives and optimal entry regulations are developed for a case where heterogeneous firms exploit a common property natural resource. The government’s objectives are to correct for resource externalities and to tax away the resource rent. Both individual output and efficiency levels are subject to private information, i.e. it is a model with multi-agency, externalities, and countervailing incentives. There are asymmetric information about the net revenue of the firm and the size of the resource externalities that the firm inflicts on the other firms in the industry. The latter implies that external effects are present both in the firms’ net incomes and in the information rents.","Volume 24, Issue 4",1 November 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/24/issue/4,66
"We compare the effects of taxes and quotas for an environmental problem where the regulator and polluter have asymmetric information about abatement costs, and environmental damage depends on pollution stock. An increase in the slope of the marginal abatement cost curve, or a decrease in the slope of the marginal damage curve, favors taxes. An increase in the discount rate or the stock decay rate favors tax usage. Taxes dominate quotas if the length of a period during which decisions are constant is sufficiently small. An empirical illustration suggests that taxes dominate quotas for the control of greenhouse gasses.","Volume 24, Issue 4",1 November 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/24/issue/4,66

"While rent taxation in some theories is neutral, and the tax rate could be set to 100% to minimise the need for distortionary taxes, this does not occur in practice. An important reason for this is the transfer incentives that would result. When cost transfers can only be imperfectly monitored, it is optimal under some conditions to combine a tax on gross revenue with a rent tax. This contributes to explaining the frequent occurrence of gross revenue taxation in actual rent tax systems, and the frequently observed tailoring of rent tax systems in response to output price changes.","Volume 24, Issue 3",June 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/24/issue/3,67
"A model of industrial companies’ demand for energy is estimated on a large micro-panel database in order to quantify the effect of different applied policy instruments (CO2 tax, voluntary agreements and subsidies to investments in energy reduction).An average energy price elasticity at −0.44 was estimated. It is also found that energy price elasticities are lower for energy-intensive companies as compared with energy-extensive companies. Results suggest that the voluntary agreements have yielded a significant reduction in energy demand. The empirical results support the projection from recent theoretical models that voluntary agreements, which are backed up by a strong threat of alternative regulation, may protect the environment even more than the regulation used as threat.","Volume 24, Issue 3",June 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/24/issue/3,67

Our results also show that the application of the procedure proposed by Tsutsui and Mino [Journal of Economic Theory 52 (1990) 136] to construct a Markov-perfect equilibrium using non-linear strategies is problematic when the initial pollution stock is lower than the Pareto-efficient pollution stock.","Volume 24, Issue 3",June 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/24/issue/3,67
"This paper deals with rent-seeking behaviour among agents who compete for future shares of a common renewable natural resource. Rent-seeking might become profitable when the agents expect that the distribution of the natural resource in the coming periods will be dependent on the agents’ extraction of the resource in the past, even though high exploitation might reduce the stock that future individual quotas will be based upon. Whether aggressive rent-seeking behaviour by one agent will encourage other agents to rent-seek more, however, is generally found to be ambiguous.","Volume 24, Issue 3",June 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/24/issue/3,67

"The analysis examines how resource injury information provided by a questionnaire affects contingent valuations. A key determinant is the difference between new and prior information. Redundant information has no effect. Also, respondents have different priors so the effect of new information is uneven; information increases restoration value for some respondents while reducing it for others. Empirical results confirmed the heterogeneity of respondents. Values were sensitive to the broad dimensions of a resource injury, such as the geographic extent and toxicity. Injury details had less significant effects that varied from positive to negative in algebraic sign.","Volume 24, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-174 (15 February 2002)",15 February 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/24/issue/1,68
"This paper uses housing market data to examine the relationship between newspaper coverage of local hazardous waste sites and housing prices.

We restrict our sample to those houses sold more than once in order to eliminate confounding timE−invariant determinants of housing price. Our findings indicate a price increase of approximately US$ 100–200 per article, which could suggest that the publicity either led residents to lower their perceptions of risk or led them to increase their expectations of a clean-up (or both).","Volume 24, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-174 (15 February 2002)",15 February 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/24/issue/1,68

"This paper analyzes the implications of CO2 abatement when there is endogenous technological change in renewable energy. A multi-sector numerical general equilibrium model for Denmark is proposed to reflect two basic assumptions about technological progress in renewable energy. First, there is learning-by-doing and unit costs of production are a decreasing function of cumulated output. Second, technological progress only benefits new vintages of capital. The learning-by-doing process is calibrated to match current projections for technological progress in wind-based electricity. The implications are a marked reduction in the total and marginal cost of abatement and a decline in the optimal level of near-term abatement.","Volume 23, Issue 4",1 October 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/23/issue/4,69

"Dichotomous choice contingent valuation questions are relatively inefficient in that large sample sizes are required for a given level of estimation precision. An increasingly common approach to this problem is to supplement the initial question with subsequent dichotomous choice questions in a multiple-bound design. However, a number of commentators have suggested that such designs may generate responses which are internally inconsistent in that the distribution of underlying preferences implied by answers to the initial question may not be the same as that implied by the entire sequence of replies. We consider a variety of potential causes of such inconsistencies and use data from a contingent valuation study with two follow-ups and post survey debriefing focus groups to test both the effects caused by moving from one bound to another and those caused when respondents follow either the bid-increasing path generated by a positive response at a given bid amount, or the bid-decreasing path generated by negative responses. Results indicate that both bound and path effects are significant and generate a pattern corresponding to certain of the causes of inconsistency identified in the paper. Conclusions for the future application of such designs are presented.","Volume 23, Issue 3",July 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/23/issue/3,70
"This paper uses patent data to estimate the effect of new technologies on energy consumption. Matching energy patent counts to the industries using these patents, I create stocks of energy knowledge for 13 industries. Including the stocks in restricted variable cost functions, I estimate the median present value of long run savings from a new patent to be over US$ 14.5 million. Combining these results with estimates of price-induced innovation, I conclude that two-thirds of the change in energy consumption with respect to a price change is due to simple price-induced factor substitution, while the remaining third results from induced innovation.","Volume 23, Issue 3",July 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/23/issue/3,70
"We consider optimal fishery management under the assumption of increasing returns that is supported by previous empirical evidence. We improve the tractability and realism of the previous approaches by introducing flow adjustment costs on changes in harvest rate. Our framework is the first to provide a link between stable limit cycle policies and increasing returns in harvesting. The type of the harvest policy depends on flow adjustment costs: for relatively costly adjustments the usual steady state harvest policy is conceivable, whereas for relatively cheap adjustments the harvest policy is cyclical. We also show a connection between chattering control policies and limit cycles, which helps us to develop a clear economic meaning for cyclical harvesting.","Volume 23, Issue 3",July 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/23/issue/3,70

"Departing from Hotelling’s assumption of fixed and known reserves, this paper develops an economic model of additions to proven reserves that explicitly incorporates the effects of expected resource price, cumulative reserves development, and technological progress on reserve additions. The model treats additions to proven oil reserves as output of a production process in which drilling wells is a primary input to transform some of oil-in-place into the economic category of proven reserves. Application of the model to US data for the 1950–1995 period provides strong statistical support for the existence of all the three salient effects. We obtain an estimate of the price elasticity of reserve additions (absent from previous studies) which, although statistically highly significant, is rather small. Using this price elasticity estimate, it is shown that if in the face of steady economic growth, and hence, oil consumption, US oil import dependence is to be kept from rising in the future, ceteris paribus, a steady oil price increase in the range of 1.5–4.5% a year is essential.","Volume 23, Issue 3",July 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/23/issue/3,70

"Timber trade restrictions have been proposed as a means to reducing tropical deforestation. This paper analyses the consequences of such trade interventions, emphasising the effects on logging behaviour and the allocation of land between forestry and alternative activities (e.g. agriculture). Tropical forestry is modelled as the mining of a heterogeneous, non-renewable resource. Two different harvesting procedures — sequential and simultaneous harvest, are examined. The analysis suggests that logging will be reduced if timber trade restrictions reduce the log price equally for all tree qualities. But if the price reduction is non-uniform, logging may increase in some fields. In fact, total logging may increase as well. It is also shown that timber trade restrictions do not necessarily promote the conversion of forestland to alternative uses.","Volume 23, Issue 2",April 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/23/issue/2,71

All projects reduce emissions elsewhere in the Nordic region, and the environmental costs of these emissions are not, in general, fully reflected in market prices. We develop a theory of second best optimal regulation for this case. The optimal regulation is found to deviate substantially from a purely domestic regulation. For instance, we find it optimal to grant a substantial credit to energy conservation.

It is shown that the superiority of the nonlinear-tax instrument in which the corrective tax coincides with the expected schedule of marginal benefit may break down in favor of a linear-tax or a quantity instrument when the policy environment shifts from the case of independently distributed to the case of correlated uncertainties. With various combinations of parameter values of the two probability distributions, we also construct three distinct ranges in each of which one instrument turns out to be superior to the other two.","Volume 23, Issue 2",April 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/23/issue/2,71
"Empirical estimates of long run effects on residential electricity demand from changes in the electricity price are usually estimated by cross-sectional variation in the current stock of electric household appliances across households at a certain point in time. Here, we use a discrete–continuous approach modeling the long run effects by investments in new appliances. We apply the annual Norwegian Survey of Consumer Expenditure for the period 1975 to 1994 to estimate the short and long run own price elasticities in the two approaches. We find the estimated long run elasticity only slightly more price elastic than the short run. We also find that the long run elasticity does not differ significantly between the two approaches. The reason for both results is that, since there is no alternative source of energy for these appliances, there are no substitution effects.","Volume 23, Issue 1",January 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/23/issue/1,72

"This paper concerns the role of environmental taxation in a model with endogenous technological change, where the latter implies that natural inputs become more productive. The timing of technological change is, in turn, uncertain and the likelihood of discovering the new technology is related to the amount of resources spent on R&D. The analysis is based on a dynamic general equilibrium model. One purpose of the paper is to design a policy so as to internalize the external effects arising from pollution and R&D. Another is to develop cost benefit rules for green tax reforms, when the initial equilibrium is suboptimal.","Volume 23, Issue 1",January 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/23/issue/1,72
"It is generally accepted that production processes should take into account environmental sustainability principles. Hence, any attempt to measure the performance of these processes should highlight, as a reference standard, those processes that combine greater amounts of desirable production with lower levels of undesirable outputs, e.g. waste generation or emissions of greenhouse gases. Using this concept of environmental performance, it is possible to establish efficiency scores within a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) framework, and to calculate desirable output losses when specific environmental standards on undesirable production are set by the authority, i.e. legislative opportunity costs. This can be achieved by solving programming models that call for a reduction of undesirable outputs and that stress the weak disposability of such outputs. Once a standard is set, it congests or binds the technology if the reductions in undesirable production required to meet it imply lower desirable output levels, i.e. the regulation is costly. DEA enables us to simulate, for each producer, the effect of any regulatory standard on production, and the limits beyond which production is impossible — lower limits, or superfluous — upper limits, because the chosen standard does not bind production. The empirical implications of the DEA process are analyzed considering different regulatory scenarios on CO2 emissions for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s manufacturing industries.","Volume 23, Issue 1",January 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/23/issue/1,72
"Labor productivity in the U.S. copper mining industry tripled between 1975 and 1995, allowing the industry to recover its comparative advantage. Mine level data on output and labor input indicate that over three-quarters of this increase came from labor productivity growth at individual mines, and less than a quarter from shifts in output from low- to high-productivity mines. This finding supports the hypothesis that new technology and innovation are as important or more important than mineral endowment in shaping labor productivity trends and comparative advantage in mining.","Volume 22, Issue 4",October 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/22/issue/4,73
"This paper examines the impacts of climate fluctuations on carbon emissions using monthly models of US energy demand. The econometric analysis estimates price, income, and weather elasticities of short-run energy demand. Our model simulations suggest that warmer climate conditions in the US since 1982 slightly reduced carbon emissions in the US. Lower energy use associated with reduced heating requirements offsets higher fuel consumption to meet increased air-conditioning needs. The analysis also suggests that climate change policies should allow some variance in carbon emissions due to short-term weather variations.","Volume 22, Issue 4",October 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/22/issue/4,73
"A significant negative trend in the long-term price of natural gas at the wellhead is revealed from simulations with a partial equilibrium model of the industry in the United States. The model framework consists of a simultaneous equations system for production from reserves and for demands for production in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. We utilize a wide range of historical data to calibrate the model and then develop two sets of scenarios for future prices, one based on further industry development under current regulation, and the other based on deregulation and development of an open market for gas services. The key variables — price of natural gas, level of production and inground gas reserves — for the next 10 years improve for the consumer whether or not there is deregulation but the second scenario leaves the consumer better off sooner.","Volume 22, Issue 4",October 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/22/issue/4,73

"This paper addresses the optimal long-term management of an accumulative but assimilable pollutant through economic incentive policies that restrict more damaging production processes and induce more benign alternatives. Using a simple general equilibrium approach, we consider the possibility that the assimilative capacity of the environment is eventually exhausted by pollution accumulation. In this case, there is a nonconvexity in the problem that gives rise to multiple potential optima; environmental quality may be preserved or completely degraded in the long term. We characterize the circumstances under which phasing out dirty production is consistent with an intertemporally optimizing path and we discuss the design of price-based and quantity-based policies for supporting an optimal solution with the nonconvexity.","Volume 22, Issue 4",October 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/22/issue/4,73

"Option-pricing is used to evaluate the sequence and timing of wilderness preservation, resource extraction, and development. Resource extraction or development results in the permanent destruction of wilderness and the loss of an amenity dividend. Resource extraction does not preclude subsequent development. If the wilderness is directly developed (without prior extraction of resources), wilderness and resource extraction options are both killed. Starting from a state of wilderness, there are two stochastically evolving barriers, one for the price of the resource, and the other for the return on development. Wilderness is preserved provided the price of the resource never catches the price barrier and the return on development never catches the return barrier.","Volume 22, Issue 3",July 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/22/issue/3,74
"This paper analyses decision under uncertainty with catastrophic risks, and is motivated by problems emerging from global environmental risks. These are typically low-probability events with major irreversible consequences. For such risks, the Von Neumann–Morgenstern (NM) axioms for decision making under uncertainty are not appropriate, since they are shown here to be insensitive to low-probability events. The paper introduces an alternative set of axioms requiring sensitivity to both low- and large-probability events. Through a new representation theorem in functional analysis, the results characterize all the operators whose maximization leads to the fulfillment of these axioms. They involve a convex combination of expected utility and a criterion based on the desire to avoid low probability and potentially catastrophic events. It is shown that the new axioms help resolve the Allais paradox. Open questions about risk aversion, games under uncertainty and calculus of variations are discussed.","Volume 22, Issue 3",July 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/22/issue/3,74
"The standard framework in which economists evaluate environmental policies is cost–benefit analysis, so policy debates usually focus on the expected flows of costs and benefits, or on the choice of discount rate. But this can be misleading when there is uncertainty over future outcomes, when there are irreversibilities, and when policy adoption can be delayed. This paper shows how two kinds of uncertainty — over the future costs and benefits of reduced environmental degradation, and over the evolution of an ecosystem — interact with two kinds of irreversibilities — sunk costs associated with an environmental regulation, and sunk benefits of avoided environmental degradation — to affect optimal policy timing and design.","Volume 22, Issue 3",July 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/22/issue/3,74

"Each individual consumes a numeraire capital-consumption good, harvests “fish” from a common property resource, and makes child-bearing and capital bequest decisions in her one-period life. The model is developed in a way that traces the physical impacts of harvest choices across generations. Consistent with previous results in models with pollution, it is shown that the efficient resolution of the stock externality can be accomplished by a combination of Pigouvian harvest and a child-bearing tax. Results are extended to show that the creation of asset-like individual transferable quotas (ITQs) induces efficient harvest and child-bearing decisions without a child-bearing tax. Clarifying previous results, it is shown that the social discount rate is equal to the common net-of-Pigouvian-tax rate of return on capital in both industries.","Volume 22, Issue 2",May 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/22/issue/2,75
"This paper considers two alternative models of firm dynamics and uses a nonparametric test to evaluate their empirical relevance to the U.S. oil industry. I am interested in the class of models that control for the selection induced by firm liquidation and that explain how similar firms operating under the same conditions can exhibit very different activity paths. Such variability is generally associated with a source of uncertainty that is specific to the firm, generating idiosyncratic differences in behavior over time. In particular, I consider Jovanovic's (1982) [Jovanovic, B., 1982. Selection and evolution of the industry.

"Load management programs are used by electric utilities to decrease peak consumption. Although they are generally offered simultaneously with regular service, economic models of their allocative efficiency are based on the implicit assumption that they are the only service available. We present a model in which participation to a particular load management program, called self-rationing, is optional. We show that, under a break-even constraint, welfare-maximizing prices involve a subsidy from the self-rationing program to regular service whenever peak demand is less elastic than base demand. If cross-subsidization is precluded, regular service is viable only if there exist transaction costs to participate in the self-rationing program.","Volume 22, Issue 2",May 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/22/issue/2,75
"Two basic questions that arise in international policy debates over greenhouse gas emission reduction are: (1) How much to control? and (2) Who pays? In this paper, we investigate the interdependence between these two issues. We characterize general conditions under which the Pareto-optimal environmental control will depend on the distribution of the cost burden among nations and provide a sufficient condition under which a Pareto optimum can be implemented by a market mechanism with tradable emission permits. However, numerical results suggest that the interdependence may be weak in a hypothetical negotiation between the OECD and the ROW (the rest of the world).

"This paper explores the link between pollution taxes and the financial and output decisions of firms in an oligopolistic industry facing demand uncertainty. It is shown that environmental regulations such as pollution taxes may induce firms to alter their financial structure, which in turn influences both output levels and the effectiveness of the tax in controlling pollution emissions. It is demonstrated that there exist circumstances in which highly leveraged firms may respond to pollution taxes by expanding output and emission levels. This possibility arises in a leveraged oligopoly since the tax acts as a credible commitment device which leads to more aggressive competition in output markets.","Volume 22, Issue 1",January 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/22/issue/1,76

"The Nuclear Liability Act (1970) limits the liability of nuclear reactor operators in Canada to the first $75 m of any off-site damage done by an accident. In recent litigation, the limitation has been challenged. It has been argued that the implicit subsidy which such a provision confers encourages the use of nuclear over other fuel sources and reduces safety incentives. During the litigation, it was contended that the value of the subsidy could be as high as 12 to 16 cents per kW h. We use numerical curve-fitting techniques to evaluate the subsidy using data implicit in insurance premiums and under a range of expert assessments regarding `worst case' scenarios. In most cases, the subsidy is found to be less than 1 cent per kW h, and in no case is it greater than 4 cents. While the uninternalised costs are not trivial they are smaller than existing estimates of those associated with the use of alternative fuels.","Volume 22, Issue 1",January 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/22/issue/1,76
"This paper investigates the significance of induced technological change (ITC) for the attractiveness of CO2 abatement policies. We use analytical and numerical general equilibrium models in which technological change results from profit-maximizing investments in R&D. We show that carbon abatement policies have very different impacts on R&D across industries, and do not necessarily raise the economy-wide rate of technological progress. Focusing only on the sectors with positive R&D impacts can lead to substantial underassessment of the GDP costs of CO2 abatement policies. The presence of ITC implies lower costs of achieving a given abatement target, but it implies higher gross costs (costs before netting out environment-related benefits) of a given carbon tax. Gross costs depend importantly on the efficiency of R&D markets prior to the introduction of CO2 policies.","Volume 21, Issues 3–4",August 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/21/issue/3,77
"Considerable uncertainty surrounds both the consequences of climate change and their valuation over horizons of decades or centuries. Yet, there have been few attempts to factor such uncertainty into current policy decisions concerning stringency and instrument choice. This paper presents a framework for determining optimal climate change policy under uncertainty and compares the resulting prescriptions to those derived from a more typical analysis with best-guess parameter values. Uncertainty raises the optimal level of emission reductions and leads to a preference for taxes over rate controls. This suggests that analyses which ignore uncertainty can lead to inefficient policy recommendations.","Volume 21, Issues 3–4",August 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/21/issue/3,77

A numerical model is presented, which takes into account both continuous climate-feedback damages as well as the possibility of a catastrophic outcome. The possibility of a climate catastrophe is a major argument for greenhouse gas abatement even in absence of continuous damage. Special attention is given to the subjective probability of a catastrophe and the pure rate of time preferences, and implicit values of these parameters are calculated if an emissions stabilisation target is assumed optimal. Finally, the expected value of perfect information about the probability of a catastrophe is estimated.","Volume 21, Issues 3–4",August 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/21/issue/3,77

In fact, the superiority of emissions taxes and emissions permits over other instruments can hinge on whether these policies generate revenues that are used to reduce other distortionary taxes.","Volume 21, Issues 3–4",August 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/21/issue/3,77

Cost savings and emissions reductions patterns which will arise under several different scenarios are determined through the use of a dynamic, relaxed mixed-integer linear programming model of the NOx allowance market.

"This paper develops a framework to explore the implications of trade and domestic policy distortions for the magnitude of carbon emissions and for the welfare costs of abating these emissions. An application to the electricity-generating sector in India shows that economic policy reforms can also be effective environmental policy instruments and reduce carbon emissions even in the absence of an emissions tax. This reduction in emissions is accompanied by an increase in domestic welfare, an increase in electricity output, and conservation of coal. Coordinating trade and domestic policy reform with an emissions tax policy reduces emissions further, while leading to gains in welfare that are greater than those under an emissions tax policy alone.","Volume 21, Issue 2",May 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/21/issue/2,78
"In 1978, Congress passed the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) in response to the energy crisis of the early 1970s. One of the unintended results of PURPA has been to show that electric generation was not a natural monopoly and could be opened to competition. Both the theoretical and empirical determinants of cogeneration and how they may be affected by future electric power industry restructuring are important for future industrial generation decisions. This paper explores these determinants and identifies differences between industrial cogenerators which sell power back into the electricity grid (commercial generators) and those which keep all of their electricity generation for internal purposes (self generators). The empirical results indicate that increases in industrial firm technical capabilities tends to increase their probabilities of both commercial and self generating. In addition, the models indicate that increases in retail electricity prices and industrial output increases industrial generation probabilities. The ability to switch fuels enhances industrial generation probabilities, as does a decrease in the price of natural gas. The results also imply that under electric restructuring a number of industrial generators may find that they face a stranded cost problem much like the one faced by their electric utility counterparts.","Volume 21, Issue 2",May 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/21/issue/2,78

"The present study examines the optimal use of renewable resources and how optimality is linked to the accumulation of waste stock. Production technology choices are based on a maximization of a discounted stream of net utility over time with respect to constancy of environmental services. When adopting a socially optimal tax-subsidy scheme to price produced goods, the ultimate utility level is determined by how tax revenues and subsidies compensate each other in monetary terms. Therefore, the constraints imposed on the optimal use of economic instruments in promoting recycling when a government budget is balanced are also studied.

"The environment provides two different kinds of services: consumptive (input for conventional goods' production, pollution) and non-consumptive (amenity). The environment, which is treated as a renewable resource, might be harvested to obtain the first service, pollution (e.g., emissions, waste). However, reducing current pollution is costly and takes time; this adjustment process provides the second state. We show in this paper that the associated optimal environmental policies may be complex. More precisely, dampened oscillations and limit cycles (pollution following abatement and so on) may describe an optimal strategy even for strictly concave technologies and preferences. However, complex strategies—limit cycles and instabilities—are restricted to weakly green social preferences.","Volume 21, Issue 1",January 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/21/issue/1,79

Results from the lab suggest that efficiency remained relatively robust to discrete and increasing marginal delay costs, but declined significantly with nonincreasing marginal delay costs. Bargainers appear to deal with probability and consequences separately rather than in combination as maintained by expected utility theory, and as such, neglect ends over means.

"When regulating electricity distribution utilities, estimates of the past productivity improvement performance are very important for future requirements. A piecewise linear frontier technology, reflecting observed best practice, accommodating the multi-output nature of distribution utilities is specified. A Malmquist index and its components, shift in frontier technology and change in efficiency, have been calculated for the period 1983 to 1989. The main results are a positive productivity growth averaging nearly 2% per year, and that this is mainly due to frontier technology shift. Outliers are scrutinised, but do not influence results for non-outliers.","Volume 20, Issue 3",September 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/3,81
"The response of residential households to voluntary Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity rates is estimated using data from a recent experiment at Midwest Power Systems of Iowa. The study's design allows us to examine both the participation decision and the customer's load pattern changes once the TOU rate structure was in effect. Substitution elasticities between on-peak and off-peak electricity usage are estimated and compared to those obtained in earlier mandatory programs, indicating whether program volunteers are more responsive to TOU pricing than the typical household. Attitudinal questionnaires allow us to examine the role of usage perceptions in program participation.","Volume 20, Issue 3",September 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/3,81
"It is said that since the mid-1980s oil has become a commodity like others, and exhibits noticeable price volatility. How then do oil price fluctuations compare with those of other commodities? To address this question, we examine three aspects of price volatility for two marker crude oils and nine other widely traded commodities. Our results suggest that between 1985 and 1994 crude oil is in the upper end of the range of all measures of price volatility studied, but is not clearly beyond the bounds set by other commodities. Implications of this result for the oil industry are discussed.","Volume 20, Issue 3",September 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/3,81
"Usually firms operate with a restricted number of energy sources. In the dairy industry, most firms have multi-energy systems allowing them to shift from one energy source to another at almost no cost. Zero expenditures are observed because firms minimize costs and non-negativity constraints on the demand functions are binding. Estimation of demand systems when the probability of observing zero expenditures is not nil has already received attention from econometricians. However, most surveys generally report prices only for the subset of goods actually purchased. The econometrician faces a problem of missing price observations when zero expenditures occur. The originality of our approach is to propose a combined and coherent treatment of both the zero expenditures and missing data. Price equations are added to the demand system and the cost-minimizing mix of energy inputs leads to a simultaneous equation/limited dependent variable model. A general framework is provided in which it is possible to formulate parameter restrictions which guarantee consistency of the cost minimizing model and its relationship to a generalized tobit model with errors in variables. An application to a sample drawn from a survey on firms of the French dairy industry shows the strength of a model which decomposes the choice of energy mix in two parts: a qualitative preference and a quantitative decision. A micro-simulation model gives evidence of the practical use of this study. Nonetheless some theoretical points remain unsolved and should motivate further research.","Volume 20, Issue 3",September 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/3,81
"In this paper we use conjoint analysis to predict participation intentions for an optional energy service offered by Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (NMPC). In contrast to conjoint studies that use ordinary least squares regression to estimate a utility or preference function, we use an ordered probit model. For validation, we compare predicted participation from the probit model to actual behavior. We also compare predictions from Sawtooth Software's Adaptive Conjoint Analysis (ACA) software to actual behaviour. The predictions obtained from the ordered probit model are closer to actual behaviour than the predictions obtained from the linear model.

"Environmental goods including services of natural resources and health are examples of goods not priced by trade in markets, for which it is widely agreed that monetary valuations are needed to throw light on their worth relative to market goods. Econometric and other approaches deducing values through revealed behavior constitute one way to estimate true values. Interview techniques are another. Some take strong views in favor of one of the two ways. Others take the eclectic view that both ways have something to offer and are needed in view of the difficulty at best of deducing non-market values. Most of this special volume is concerned with interview techniques, offered in the belief that this general approach is robust and susceptible to improvements that the articles explore.

"This study reports on experiments that examine anchoring in single referendum questions in contingent valuation surveys on willingness to pay for public goods, and on objective estimation. Strong anchoring effects are found that lead to systematically higher estimated mean responses from Yes/No referendum responses than from open-ended responses. This response pattern is similar for contingent valuation questions and for objective estimation questions. The paper concludes that psychometric anchoring effects, rather than incentive effects, are the likely cause of results commonly found in contingent valuation studies, and that the currently popular single referendum elicitation format is highly vulnerable to anchoring.","Volume 20, Issue 2",June 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/2,82
"Although the majority of contingent valuation studies have been for environmental goods, the method can be applied to public goods in general. Further, a specific environmental policy may generate both positive and negative nonmarket values. This exploratory study investigates the presence of nonmarket values for maintaining the status quo land use and avoiding social impacts from an environmental policy change. The test case, grazing reform on federal lands in New Mexico, was chosen because of the complexity of the public debate. By switching the traditional perspective, we demonstrate the need to accommodate multi-dimensionality in nonmarket research into controversial policies.","Volume 20, Issue 2",June 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/2,82
"We explore implications of the failure of the individual to behave in accordance with the predictions of the utility maximization paradigm for the application of consumer sovereignty principles to the valuation of environmental goods. A subjective probability framework is used to develop an index of the completeness and the coherence of the individual's risk-neutral beliefs and valuations. These beliefs and valuations are shown to be institution-dependent, and thus endogenous to the choices the individual makes about the medium in which to express herself. A variety of propositions about the influence of incomplete beliefs on value expressions is derived.","Volume 20, Issue 2",June 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/2,82
"Embedding, the notion that respondents to contingent valuation (CV) questions often value more than the researcher intends, has engendered extreme views. These range from the suggestion that embedding is so severe that it renders CV useless to the assertion that embedding can be eliminated by providing sufficient information in a survey. This paper examines three alternative explanations for embedding: 1) the purchase of moral satisfaction, 2) independent valuation and summation, and 3) mental models of joint products. Several studies that shed light on the nature of the embedding problem are presented and we examine whether it is possible to test for embedding through follow up questions that obtain self reports from respondents. We show that answers to these debriefing questions predict whether or not different groups of respondents pass a scope test (i.e., a statistically significant difference between groups valuing different levels of the same commodity). We reject the view that increased market context can solve the embedding problem. Rather, embedding may depend on the nature of the commodity itself.","Volume 20, Issue 2",June 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/2,82
"Elicitation of valid statements of contingent value requires survey participants who are familiar with the environmental resource change. A primary purpose of the contingent market must be to assure familiarity by providing information. Information about resource quality is important when incompletely informed respondents, say nonusers, perceive resource quality which diverges from true quality. Differences in perceived quality and true quality can be influenced as respondents learn from information in the contingent market. By presenting survey participants with information about four wetlands of varying qualities we test for information effects in a dichotomous choice contingent market for wetlands allocation. We find that information about quality is a determinant of willingness to pay for wetland preservation. Information about resource quality presented in contingent markets will result in more valid valuations of changes in allocations of environmental resources.","Volume 20, Issue 2",June 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/2,82

Following the Exxon Valdez damage assessments, vigorous challenges to CV were mobilized. Instead of the present preoccupation with standardizing CV methods and constructing Popperian tests of CV generically, a broad-based research program is recommended, including proliferation of methods, mapping the performance characteristics of CV, and combining contingent and observed choice data.","Volume 20, Issue 2",June 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/2,82
"A comparison of operating costs for buses used in a transit system are investigated considering four alternative fuels: biodiesel, compressed natural gas, methanol, and diesel. Rust's `nested fixed point' maximum likelihood estimation algorithm is used in this comparison. The algorithm considers both tangible costs such as fuel, maintenance, and infrastructure, and intangible costs associated with different levels of bus engine operating reliability under alternative fuels. Using data on actual monthly mileage and time of engine rebuilds under the four alternative fuels, the Rust algorithm is employed assuming that an optimal maintenance strategy is adopted for each alternative fuel type. Results indicate that although biodiesel and biodiesel blends have higher total costs than diesel fuel, they have the potential of competing with CNG and methanol as fuels for urban transit buses.","Volume 20, Issue 1",March 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/1,83

"Increasing interest in the use of marketable permits for pollution control has become evident in recent years. Concern regarding their performance still remains because empirical evidence has shown transaction costs and uncertainty to be significant in past and existing marketable permits programs. In this paper we develop theoretical and numerical models that include transaction costs and uncertainty (in trade approval) to show their effects on market performance (i.e., equilibrium price of permits and trading volume) and aggregate control costs. We also show that in the presence of transaction costs and uncertainty the initial allocation of permits may not be neutral in terms of efficiency. Furthermore, using a numerical model for a hypothetical NOx trading program in which participants have discrete control technology choices, we find that aggregate control costs and the equilibrium price of permits are sensitive to the initial allocation of permits, even for constant marginal transaction costs and certainty.","Volume 20, Issue 1",March 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/1,83

Using a model where the government receives political contributions from environmental and industry lobby groups, it then explains the use of pollution abatement subsidies in environmental policy as primarily being tools for redistribution. The pollution abatement subsidy and pollution tax are determined in political equilibrium. The equilibrium subsidy rate is shown to depend on the subsidy elasticities of pollution and abatement, and lobby group membership.","Volume 20, Issue 1",March 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/1,83

We find that the two types of bias are likely to be present, and furthermore, that forestry price series tend to be difference, rather than trend, stationary processes. These results raise doubts about the information content of composite forestry price time series, and suggest that inferences from such information about timber scarcity trends will likely be spurious. If the time series properties of forestry price series hold for other natural resources, then inferences about resource scarcity trends will also be dubious in these cases. This possibility suggests the need for further research to explore the time series properties of other natural resources.","Volume 20, Issue 1",March 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/20/issue/1,83
"We consider trade between a ‘consumer’ country with an open access renewable resource and a ‘conservationist’ country that regulates resource harvesting to maximize domestic steady-state utility. In what we call the mild overuse case, the consumer country exports the resource good and suffers steady-state losses from trade, as suggested by the conventional wisdom that weak resource management standards confer a competitive advantage on domestic firms in the resource sector but cause welfare losses. Strikingly, however, when the resource stock is most in jeopardy, the conservationist country exports the resource good in steady state and both countries experience gains from trade.","Volume 19, Issue 4",November 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/19/issue/4,84
"The NAFTA debate included assertions that were used as arguments against trade and investment liberalization. (1) Trade liberalization increases production sensitivity to environmental restrictions (‘environmental dumping’?). (2) Investment liberalization, leading to multinational firms, similarly increases the production and welfare response to costly environmental restrictions. I find that: (1) Trade liberalization increases production sensitivity to costly environmental restrictions, but arguments against liberal trade on welfare grounds do not follow. (2) Multinationals do not increase the production-reallocation effect caused by environmental restrictions or regulations.

I find that the credible threat to impose trade sanctions may be capable of sustaining full cooperation in the supply of the public good, provided the sanctions are accompanied by a minimum participation clause which serves to coordinate government behavior. In equilibrium, trade is not restricted. But if the threat to impose sanctions were not allowed by the rules of the game, supply of the public good would be Pareto-inefficient.","Volume 19, Issue 4",November 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/19/issue/4,84
"In recent debates on trade liberalisation the concern has often been expressed that with more competitive international trade governments will be worried that by setting tougher environmental policies than their trading rivals they will put domestic producers at a competitive disadvantage, and in the extreme case this could lead to firms relocating production in other countries. The response by governments to such concerns will be to weaken environmental policies (‘eco-dumping’). In competitive markets such concerns are ill founded, but there is a small amount of literature which has analysed whether governments will indeed have incentives for eco-dumping in the more relevant case of markets where there are significant scale economies; even here there is no presumption that the outcome will involve eco-dumping.In this paper we extend the analysis of strategic environmental policy and plant location decisions by analysing the location decision of firms in different sectors which are linked through an input-output structure of intermediate production. The reason why we introduce inter-sectoral linkages between firms is that they introduce an additional factor, relative to those already analysed in the literature, in the plant location decision, which is the incentive for firms in different sectors to agglomerate in a single location. This has a number of important effects. First, there is now the possibility of multiple equilibria in location decisions of firms. Following from this there is the possibility of catastrophic effects where a small increase in an environmental tax can trigger the collapse of an industrial base in a country; however there is also the possibility that a country which raises its environmental tax could attract more firms to locate in that country, because of the way the tax affects incentives for agglomeration. Finally, and again related to the previous effects, there is the possibility of a hysteresis effect where raising an environmental tax in one country can cause firms to relocate to another country, but subsequently lowering that tax will not induce firms to relocate back into the original country.We consider a simple model with two countries, two industries, an upstream and a downstream sector, and two firms per industry. The analysis proceeds through a three-stage game: in the first stage the governments of the two countries set their environmental policies; in the second stage the firms in both industries choose how many plants to locate and where; in the third stage firms choose their output levels, with the demand for the upstream firms being determined endogenously by the production decisions of the downstream firms. We assume that there are no limits to production capacity, so that firms do not build more than one plant in any country. However, firms may build plants in different countries because of positive transport costs. Although the model appears very simple, it cannot be solved analytically, so all the conclusions must be drawn from numerical simulations.","Volume 19, Issue 4",November 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/19/issue/4,84
"It is well known that in the event of a shortage in generation capacity, it is inefficient if the electricity utility cuts off customers randomly. It is preferable to set up a market in service priority in which customers who have a greater need pay more for the right not to be cut off. We use an econometric model of outage costs in Israel to calculate the menu of priority rates by season and time of day.

"Environmental quotas tend to compound the welfare cost of pre-existing tax distortions in the labor market. Under plausible parameters, this source of welfare loss can easily be large enough to outweigh the entire partial equilibrium welfare gain from the quota. Environmental taxes induce the same interaction effect, however they also raise government revenues. If the revenues are used to reduce distortionary taxes, then most of this interaction effect can be offset. Therefore, revenue-raising can be a necessary condition for environmental policies to increase welfare.","Volume 19, Issue 3",August 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/19/issue/3,85
"Taxing a nonrenewable resource typically shifts production through time, compresses the economically recoverable resource base and shrinks social welfare. But by how much?

Proportionate social welfare losses from fixed royalties up to 30% are found to be small and the excess burden stands at less than 6.5% for a 30% royalty.

"The paper considers the effects of introducing large scale gas power production capacity into an electricity sector based on hydropower. In this process the economic rent is transmitted from the hydro power sector to the resource rent in the gas power sector, but is along the way intermingled with ordinary producer surplus and quasi-rent stemming from increasing cost conditions in the production infrastructure and capacity constraints. The net effect on total rent generated depends on development in demand, demand elasticities, costs saved from delaying hydropower projects and the existence of producer surplus in gas power generation. The paper closes with a discussion of possible tax base changes following from the introduction of a thermal power system based on natural gas.","Volume 19, Issue 3",August 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/19/issue/3,85
"This paper presents some simulations of the proposed California power exchange, or pool, as it might interact with the regional market in the western US. Pooling will increase interdependence with the regional market. We study this using a multi-area chronological production simulation model. We find that overall operating economies resulting from pooling are small. Physical changes in the dispatch of the electrical system, however, are rather large in comparison with the economic effects. The two driving forces for the physical changes are the reduced unit commitment resulting from pooling and transmission pricing policy. As a result of increased regional trade, transmission congestion increases. The costs of congestion appear small, however, since marginal costs in the regional are quite close to one another. Within the California pool, marginal cost pricing will produce economic rents for the generating companies. These rents are not particularly large, especially in light of the fixed operating and maintenance costs of the plants that must be covered by those rents. Finally we examine the potential for new entry into the market. Entry conditions in the near term does not appear particularly favorable. If the fixed costs of new supply are sufficiently low to allow entry, regional economics show no clear preference for siting within California versus more remote locations. The trade-off between moving gas versus transmitting power does not show a clear trend. These results are quite preliminary, but suggest that quantitative modeling of electricity restructuring can yield useful insights.","Volume 19, Issues 1–2",March 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/19/issue/1,86

"Creating efficient, competitive power markets in an electric industry composed of interconnected control areas requires the existence of some agency with authority to define, impose and enforce rules for the operation of all control areas so interconnected. It has been noted that “the pursuit of self-interest, unrestrained by suitable institutions, carries no guarantee of anything except chaos”. In no part of the economy is this lesson more relevant than in the North American electric industry. As the industry evolves from one dominated by vertically-integrated utilities into one with competitive power markets and unregulated generators, the system of coordinating institutions that has worked acceptably well to restrain and guide self-interested decision makers of economically regulated firms must now be reconstructed to restrain and guide self-interested decision makers of unregulated generating companies (gencos), power merchants and brokers.","Volume 19, Issues 1–2",March 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/19/issue/1,86

"This paper investigates the regional air pollution effects that could result from new opportunities for inter-regional power transmission in the wake of more competitive electricity markets. The key determinant of changes in electricity generation and transmission is the relative cost of electricity among neighboring regions. The key determinant of how much additional power would be traded is the uncommitted electricity transfer capability between regions, including its possible future expansion. The changes in emissions of NOx and CO2 that result from changes in the utilization of existing coal-fired facilities are modeled as a function of the average emission rate for each pollutant in each region, coupled with assumptions about the extent of displacement of coal-fired generation in the importing regions. We employ an atmospheric transport model to predict the changes in atmospheric concentrations of nitrates as a component of particulate matter (PM-10) and NOx in each region (but not changes in ozone), as well as changes in CO2 emissions.Our findings suggest that, in the year 2000, emissions of NOx could increase by 213 000 to 478 900 t as a result of restructuring. The changes in NOx emissions should be considered in the context of an expected decrease in annual emissions of over 2 million t that will result from full implementation of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments over the next few years; nonetheless, these changes would have adverse health effects. Consequences for increased CO2 emissions range between 75 and 133.9 million t. Changes in pollutant concentrations resulting from changes in NOx emissions (excluding secondary ozone changes) would be substantially greater in regions where generation is increasing than in neighboring regions.","Volume 19, Issues 1–2",March 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/19/issue/1,86

Most significant among the factors for which there remains significant scientific uncertainty are the selection and application of air dispersion models, selection of air pollution thresholds for health impacts, reduced life span risks associated with ozone exposure and with long-term exposure to PM10, values for CO2 damages, and the value to be applied to increased risks of reduced life span for individuals age 65 or older.","Volume 18, Issue 4",December 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/4,87

"Because abatement of global climate change is a public good, independent national actions may not produce the efficient quantity. Using a numerical integrated-assessment model, abatement costs and damages induced by climate change are compared at the cooperative and noncooperative solutions to a set of two-party dynamic games between the industrialized and developing countries. Games with perfect and imperfect information about climate and economic factors are considered. Across 144 games with perfect information, incorporating different values of climate and economic parameters, the noncooperative solution usually yields global benefits comparable to those of the cooperative solution. In about one-fifth of these games, however, a second noncooperative solution exists which yields none of the benefits of the cooperative solution. In a game with imperfect information, where the state of nature is uncertain in the first but known in the second of two periods, the expected benefits of the noncooperative solution are 98% of the expected benefits of the cooperative solution. In contrast to single-agent studies which show little cost to delaying abatement, the benefits of cooperation are usually lost if cooperation is delayed 20 years.","Volume 18, Issue 3",October 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/3,88
We survey studies of simple energy supply models to find the most promising technique for developing supply elasticities in the U.S. crude oil market. The two dozen studies located include direct estimates of energy supply elasticities or cost studies from which supply or reserve elasticities can be inferred. We include all available studies for all forms of energy both primary and secondary. We find direct estimates of oil supply to obtain weak results unless depletion and price expectations are included. Oil product supply elasticities vary widely across studies but appear to be elastic. Studies that estimate reserve price elasticities by computing reserve costs appear to be the most promising for estimating reserve elasticities for fossil fuel supply. Hence we apply this technique to US oil reserves and find a reserve elasticity of 1.27.,"Volume 18, Issue 3",October 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/3,88
"The Hotelling model of the optimal depletion of an exhaustible resource specifies that in a world without risk, equilibrium rates of return on nonrenewable resource assets and on alternative assets will be equalized. In applied work, where the rate of return on the resource asset is typically measured as the rate of increase of marginal profits while the return on the alternative asset is measured by a market rate of interest, the Hotelling model has not, in general, held up well to empirical scrutiny.In the recent literature, the Hotelling model has been reconsidered in the context of a world where risk is present. In such a context, the expected rates of return on an exhaustible resource and on other assets will not necessarily be equalized in equilibrium. In fact, unless agents are risk neutral, the relative riskiness of the resource asset will play a crucial role in a ‘risk-adjusted’ Hotelling rule. Specifically, with competitive firms, the expected rate of return on an exhaustible resource will differ from the expected rate of return on alternative assets by the risk premium associated with the resource asset.In this paper we investigate how well this ‘risk-adjusted’ Hotelling model withstands empirical scrutiny. Given the role of expectations in this modified Hotelling rule and in the Euler equations that yield this rule, we use Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation in our empirical analysis. Our application, which is based on three different utility specifications, examines returns for various resource industries (lead, zinc, copper, silver), utilizing aggregate annual Canadian price, extraction cost, and interest rate data since 1950.","Volume 18, Issue 3",October 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/3,88
"This study offers a simple methodology to analyze the impacts of proposed environmental standards on the mining industry and applies it to Peruvian data. The impacts are estimated with two alternative approaches, the discounted cash flow (DCF) and option pricing (OPM) methods, and their results are compared. The findings show that the new standards would cause large reductions in the values of mines under consideration. Environmental expenditures which are prescribed by the two standards are examined in the context of optimal timing of investment (A. Dixit, Investment and Hysteresis, Journal of Economics Perspective, Vol. 6 no. 1, 1992, pp. 107–132); the sensitivity of option values with respect to the duration of postponement period are calculated. The results indicate that even though allowing for a postponement option keeps the mines open, it does not lead the mines to actually undertake the necessary investments without any subsidies. Finally, the effectiveness of two alternative subsidy schemes are analyzed; it is found that conditional (state-specific) subsidies are not as effective as unconditional subsidies.","Volume 18, Issue 3",October 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/3,88
"This paper examines how changes in electricity costs can alter input use in farming and the resulting composition of output. The agricultural sectors of two states, Arizona and Colorado, are modeled using nonlinear optimization methods to estimate responses to to increases in electricity costs, and do so in ways that involve three areas of change: (1) the substitution between water and other inputs; (2) the crop allocation on irrigated land; and (3) changes in the total irrigated area. For both states, higher electricity prices lead to reductions in water use, with most of these reductions accounted for by reductions in electrically pumped groundwater use, with own-price own-price elasticities on the order of −0.64 and −0.68 for Arizona and Colorado, respectively, a result comparable to estimates obtained econometrically elsewhere. The results also confirm complementarity between energy and irrigated land and substitutability between energy and dryland acreage.","Volume 18, Issue 3",October 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/3,88
"This paper combines the theory of optimal extraction of exhaustible resources with the theory of greenhouse externalities, to analyze problems of global warming when the supply side is considered. The optimal carbon tax will initially rise but eventually fall when the externality is positively related to the stock of carbon in the atmosphere. It is shown that the tax will start falling before the stock of carbon in the atmosphere reaches its maximum. If there exists a non-polluting backstop technology, it will be optimal to extract and consume fossil fuels even when the price of fossil fuels is equal to the price of the backstop. The total extraction is the same as when the externality is ignored, but in the presence of the greenhouse effect, it will be optimal to slow the extraction and spread it over a longer period. If, on the other hand, the greenhouse externality depends on the rate of change in the atmospheric stock of carbon, the evolution of the optimal carbon tax is more complex. It can even be optimal to subsidize carbon emissions to avoid future rapid changes in the stock of carbon, and therefore future damages.","Volume 18, Issue 2",June 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/2,89
"This paper examines the double dividend hypothesis introduced by Bovenberg and Van der Ploeg. By double dividend they mean that higher pollution taxes and lower taxes on labour would not only improve the environment but also boost employment. We investigate the effect of higher prices of energy and lower nominal wages — as a result of the shift in taxes away from labour — on employment, as well as the consequences on investment and productivity.The model used is a dynamic investment model based on a putty-clay vintage structure with three inputs (labour, capital and energy) producing output. The model is calibrated using data for the Dutch private sector for the period 1953 until 1989.Our main conclusion is that shifting taxes from labour towards energy, reduces economic activity, despite factor substitution.","Volume 18, Issue 2",June 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/2,89
"The combustion of fossil fuels emits a range of damaging pollutants, the emissions of which are reduced if fossil fuel use is reduced in order to achieve CO2 abatement. These reductions are termed the secondary benefits of such abatement. The paper reviews estimates of the size of these benefits at current levels of emissions of the relevant pollutants. Although the estimates are few and uncertain, their mid-range suggests that the secondary benefits are of the same order of magnitude as the gross costs of medium to high levels of CO2 abatement, and are substantially larger than the (equally uncertain) estimates of the primary benefits of CO2 abatement, except where these benefits derive from consideration of damages from unabated global warming in the very long term. The paper then reviews these calculations in the light of the limits on SO2 emissions mandated by the Second Sulphur Protocol (SSP). It finds that the secondary benefits from abating SO2 alone beyond the limits of the SSP still provide a substantial offset to the costs of a carbon tax. The paper concludes that the existence of significant secondary benefits greatly reinforces the economic case for an aggressive policy of CO2 abatement.","Volume 18, Issue 2",June 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/2,89
"Economic growth rate rises initially with productive energy expenditures but subsequently declines. The hypothetical social planner might set optimal energy intensity. The optimal growth rate is attained at the point where energy expenditure is equal to its competitive market share. When the imperfect competitiveness of the international energy market makes the economy deviate from the optimal state, the role of the government to make the private sector change its energy use pattern becomes important. By the same token, when the world energy market is competitive, the distortionary energy price control by government may harm the economy in the long run.","Volume 18, Issue 2",June 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/2,89

We address politically significantly though easily overlooked features of the oil and gas economy, including the role of oil and gas in the rural economies where most production occurs, and the transmitting effect this production has on the state's urban economies. This latter feature is conditioned by patterns of central place trade dominance, and these are specifically captured by our model's multiregional structure.","Volume 18, Issue 2",June 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/2,89

This paper addresses the issue of whether the country can reconfigure its energy structure without hindering its future economic development. We construct a dynamic linear programming model of the Chinese economy and use it to simulate five alternative strategies to stabilize CO2 emissions at 20% of projected year 2000 baseline levels. Our results, under more optimistic assumptions, indicate this goal can be achieved with no growth penalty. However, if major technological changes relating to energy conservation and coal displacement, as well as vastly increasing availabilities of clean fuels, are not forthcoming, China could suffer a significant decline in its rate of economic growth.","Volume 18, Issue 1",March 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/1,90
"Hydro-Québec, a large government-owned electric utility serving the Province of Quebec, launched several energy savings programs as part of its 1992 development plan. It will be replacing investment in new hydro-electric power projects with investment in energy savings and intends to spend $1.9 billion from 1992 to 2000 and $2.0 billion from 2001 to 2010 on the venture. This is expected to reduce electricity demand by 9.3 TWh in 2000 (5.4% of the business as usual forecast) and by 18.0 TWh in 2010 (9.1% of the business as usual forecast). We perform a cost-benefit analysis of the programs, taking into account the financial criteria underlying electricity rates paid by consumers.We find that the programs should lead to present value benefits ranging from $2097 million to $4493 million over the 1992–2010 period, depending on the size of the electricity savings. Annual benefits range from $181.0 million to $387.7 million. Consumers are the main beneficiaries and Hydro-Québec is a marginal beneficiary. Government, however, is a net loser. The precise size of the benefits and their distribution among the three parties are sensitive to the extent of the electricity demand reduction effected by the programs.","Volume 18, Issue 1",March 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/1,90

The negotiations are modelled as a reciprocal-externality game in CO2-emissions between 5 world regions. CO2-emissions affect the players in two ways: First, each country's income depends (via energy inputs) on the amount of CO2 emitted. But emissions may also cause future damage due to climate change. The paper calculates illustrative estimates of the Nash equilibrium and the social optimum. It shows that the currently observed differences in countries' attitudes towards a CO2-reduction agreement can largely be explained by economic factors.","Volume 18, Issue 1",March 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/1,90
"This paper analyzes household appliance purchase and energy consumption and conservation related to demand for lighting. The behavioral model is estimated using data on consumers' choices between various types of electric light bulbs with large differences in purchase costs, operating costs and lifetimes. The model allows the utility attached to energy conservation per se to vary across consumers and explicitly takes into account the random nature of the lifetimes of lamps. Due to the panel nature of the data and the differences between lifetimes of high-efficiency and low-efficiency lamps, the consumer's discount rate can be estimated without assuming that he correctly perceive the operating costs. The estimated annual discount rate is about 15 percent, somewhat lower than most estimates is earlier studies.","Volume 18, Issue 1",March 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/18/issue/1,90
The concept of net national emissions suggests that accumulation of carbon in forestry should be taken into account when countries buy CO2 permits or pay CO2 taxes. The paper analyses the question of the correct tax/subsidy programme for giving proper incentives to forest owners and utilizers of wood. The analysis uses a dynamic general equilibrium model with productive capital and the stock of forests as state variables. It turns out that in a decentralized economy forest owners should be subsidized and CO2 emissions should be taxed independently of whether they originates from wood or fossil fuels.,"Volume 17, Issue 4",December 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/17/issue/4,91

"For countries having petroleum resources, a common objective of the Ministry of Energy is to maximise the net total government take from the petroleum industry. Most models of petroleum taxation, assuming symmetric information, recommend neutral taxation. A royalty is not optimal in this case as it gives disincentives for extraction, causing too much of the reservoir to remain unexploited.Through the operating activities, however, the companies obtain private information about the costs. A low cost company may conceal its information by imitating a high cost company, and must therefore be given an economic compensation (information rent) to be induced to reveal its true costs. An optimal regulatory response to asymmetric information may involve royalties, as these enable the government to capture a larger fraction of the economic rent.","Volume 17, Issue 4",December 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/17/issue/4,91

"This paper attemts an assessment of the incentives for 45 major carbon emitting countries to join various forms of international CO2 reduction agreements. The agreements considered are designed to implement a 50 percent cut in overall emissions by 2050, relative to the 1987 level (Toronto target). The paper extends previous work on emission quota schemes by considering damage functions. A major result is that a system of arbitrarily distributed flexible (tradeable) quotas may lead to a close approximation of an agreement with optimal quotas. If the distribution of flexible quotas is based on uniform emission rights per capita, the incentives to join a flexible quota agreement are similar to those to participate in an optimal quota agreement, provided the overall emission cap is the same.","Volume 17, Issue 3",November 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/17/issue/3,92
"This paper explores the economic impacts of regulatory and legislative intervention in the Clean Air Act Amendment's sulfur dioxide (SO2) allowance trading market. This intervention is of two types: (1) direct intervention through laws or regulatory orders that constrain compliance options of market participants, and (2) indirect intervention, reflected in utility decision making, and caused by a lack of regulatory policies that clarify the treatment of allowance market transactions. The paper uses a dynamic, linear programming model to empirically estimate the economic impacts of this intervention. An example of direct intervention is explored by modeling actual legislative and/or regulatory proposals in New York and Wisconsin; indirect intervention is explored through the development of a cost-uncertainty tradeoff curve. The results indicate that both types of intervention are costly and these costs must be weighed against any expected social benefits.","Volume 17, Issue 3",November 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/17/issue/3,92
"A supply model of natural gas reserve additions is developed and estimated using data on 18,000 new wells drilled in West Virginia between 1977 and 1987. The model is used to quantify the responsiveness of drilling effort and gross reserve additions to changes in the expected wellhead price, taxes, resource depletion and reserve-life index. All the results of the hypotheses tested are in line with conventional wisdom, and their consistency suggests that the model structure offers a useful approach to modeling resource supply in a mature geologic setting like West Virginia. The model structure is well-suited for regions where drilling activities and outcomes cut across formations of varying depth and is more flexible than aggregate models. The model has the capacity to evaluate the response of activity within individual geologic series to prices, taxes and costs.","Volume 17, Issue 3",November 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/17/issue/3,92
"In this study, we have examined the residential demand for electricity by time-of-day in Switzerland. For this purpose, a model of two log-linear stochastic equations for peak and off-peak electricity consumption was estimated employing aggregated data referring to four years and 40 cities. The empirical analysis has highlighted some of the characteristics of the Swiss residential electricity market. The estimated short-run own-price elasticities are −0.60 during the peak period and −0.79 during the off-peak period. Whereas in the long-run these values, as expected, are higher than in the short-run with a value of −0.71 during the peak period and −1.92 during the off-peak period. These elasticities show a high responsiveness of electricity consumption to changes in prices. Moreover, positive values of the cross-price elasticities show that peak and off-peak electricity are substitutes.","Volume 17, Issue 3",November 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/17/issue/3,92
"This paper extends the Ramsey tax rule and develops a tax rate by minimizing total excess burden, subject to government tax revenues. This tax rate is a function of its own and other fuel's price elasticities of compensated demand and supply, its own price and consumption level, other fuels' prices and consumption levels, and government revenues. It is this proposed tax rate, not the Ramsey tax ratio, that guides a government to levy a tax efficiently through a minimization of total excess burden. In the case of an energy tax, this tax rate provides direct guidance for taxation on various fuels. Moreover, total excess burden generated by the proposed tax rate is significantly less than that produced by the Clinton Administration's proposal.","Volume 17, Issue 3",November 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/17/issue/3,92
"We study the relationship between natural resources extraction, borrowing, and debt for a developing country that possesses a natural resource, in a two-period framework, and study how an outside ‘donor’ may affect the rate of extraction of the resource, through different types of policies. With no donor intervention the resource is always fully extracted over the two periods. unconditional debt forgiveness and interest rate subsidies have weak effects on the extraction rate, and may never induce the country to save the resource permanently. Conditional mechanisms have much greater effetts, and may in many cases induce the country to save the resource beyond period 2. Generally interest rate subsidies are more powerful than pure debt forgiveness, by inducing more extraction postponement or permanent saving of the resource per unit of money spent by the donor.","Volume 17, Issue 2",August 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/17/issue/2,93

"We study economic and environmental aspects of farming practices of a sample of 91 family farms around the city of Ouro Preto, in Brazil's state of Rondônia, in western Amazonia, from four overlapping perspectives. First, we estimate production functions for six activities on multiproduct farms, finding evidence of increasing returns to scale in cattle activity and possible evidence of nonindependence of profit and utility maximization in severalsubsistence crops. Second, we examine determinants of overall current farm revenue and wealth, finding possible evidence of overuse of land and underinvestment in cattle, decapitalization of farms over time, overpopulation, and trade-off between children and capital accumulation. Third, we study interactions between burning strategies, diversification of farm activities, locational choice, length of tenure on a farm, and soil quality. Longer tenure on a farm and large area in perenial crops appear to reduce the frequency of burning, while greater area in annual crops increases the frequency. Larger pasture area tends to reduce the frequency of burning below an annual periodicity. Less frequent burning appears to be accompanied by greater diversification of farm income sources. Fourth, we study the determinants of deforestation on lots, finding a negative effect of clearance costs and productivity of land and in cultivation on the clearance of new land. However, the evidence for the relationship between cattle activity and deforestation is mixed: a larger number of cattle increases the absolute amount of land deforested on a lot, but a higher proportion of income from cattle increases the ratio of cultivated land to pasture on a farm. There is also evidence of a trade-off between land quality and the quantity of land deforested.","Volume 17, Issue 2",August 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/17/issue/2,93

"We study the optimal design of a carbon tax when a group of countries seeks to maximize its net income minus its environmental costs, which depend on the sum of CO2 emissions from all countries. When both production and consumption of internationally traded fossil fuels are taxed, a particular combination of producer and consumer taxes exists which is optimal. It is also shown that with this tax the sum of the consumer tax and producer tax should be equal across all fossil fuels per unit of carbon. On the other hand, when the cooperating countries use a tax on consumption (or production) of fossil fuels as the only policy instrument, the tax per unit of carbon should in general be differentiated across fossil fuels. We close the paper by giving an empirical illustration of the theoretical analysis, assuming that the cooperating countries are those of the OECD.","Volume 17, Issue 1",May 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/17/issue/1,94

"The growing demand by countries in the eastern Mediterranean over the waters of the Jordan and Yarmuk Rivers, and the highly depleted coastal and mountain groundwater reservoirs, raise the need to explore ways and means to ameliorate existing and expected water scarcity. Economists have for some time proposed ways towards more efficient exploitation of existing water supplies, specifically by employing market incentive mechanisms in order to encourage voluntary water sharing among countries and regions. Such trading schemes may involve two or more countries. It can be shown that such schemes — given any initial assignment of property claims to water resources — can often lead to increases in the welfare of the countries concerned.The paper proposes two specific mechanisms for international markets in water claims in the eastern Mediterranean region, in which parties voluntarily engage in such trades, as they would expect to gain real benefits from these transactions. Simulation exercises with real data show that — as is true for any opening of markets to international trade — that all parties in the region might benefit to a greater or lesser degree from auctions of water.","Volume 16, Issue 4",November 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/4,95
"In this study we search for solutions to the problem of Israel's water shortage. To illustrate the shortage, we first model the water market in Israel, i.e., the corresponding supply and demand of water, and from it the dynamics of water prices. A direct way to solve the shortage problem and to reduce the high equilibrium price can be found via a different way of sharing water among the Levant countries, or by bringing more water from outside the region. The latter can take the form of conveying Nile water or water from Turkey or by constructing desalination plants along the shores. In this study we concentrate on the importing of Nile water.The costs of most of the solutions are too high compared to the returns to water in agriculture. This relation is continuously changing with the increasing demand for water for domestic and agricultural use. Our analysis shows that within 5–10 years the marginal value product of water in the area west of the Jordan river would equal the marginal costs of water from the Nile, $0.40⧸m3.","Volume 16, Issue 4",November 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/4,95
"Development of many regions in the world is conditioned on out-of-region supply of water. Sometime out-of-region may mean another country. When the contributing country has riparian rights to these water, conditions for cooperation must exist in order to transfer the water. If the allocation is assumed among countries with some level of hostility, political considerations which are usually not incorporated in economic analysis can hinder or even block the most efficient arrangement. The problem has several physical, economic and political aspects. This paper draws on a water trade framework (including transfer of water and irrigation technology), to evaluate a regional trade in water. This framework quantifies both the economic payoffs using n-person game theory, and the political likelihood of any of the coalitions actually forming, using the PRINCE Political Accounting System. The economic-political approach is applied to a case of a potential Nile water trade in the western Middle East. The results demonstrate how incorporating political considerations in the analysis may provide a more acceptable regional solution compared to the economic-related allocations.","Volume 16, Issue 4",November 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/4,95
"This article introduces a methodology to define Israeli and Palestinian property rights to the three aquifers straddling the Green Line between Israel and the West Bank, i.e. the Yarqon-Tanninim, Northern, and Nablus-Jenin aquifers. A set of procedures for determining a fair division of waters is described for the hypothetical planning year 2000. Following this, the calculated allocation of water rights is evaluated in terms of the projected over-all water consumption and supply balance for Israel and a Palestinian sovereign authority (PSA) for the year 2000. Finally, the article concludes with some thoughts on the relative merits of this methodology.","Volume 16, Issue 4",November 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/4,95

"Extracting a nonconventional resource may involve learning effects, which cause marginal costs to decline. This work integrates declining marginal costs for extracting a nonconventional resource tight gas into a model of Canadian natural gas allocation. The integration leads to representing rising, declining and constant marginal costs for different gas sources and raises the possibility of multiple price equilibria and the likelihood of extreme optimal solutions. Empirical results yield a small efficiency role for tight gas and suggest that only implausible circumstances involving rapidly declining marginal costs and large reserves could make its role more than marginal. Certain results appear generalizable.","Volume 16, Issue 3",August 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/3,96

This paper derives the conditions for an electric utility's least-cost spending on demand-side management (DSM) programs. It also develops the terms of trade for power import and for subsidizing DSM in another utility. The conditions are illustrated using the cost data collected for two utilities in the Western United States. Our findings suggest an opportunity for a mutually beneficial exchange of DSM spending for electric power when the power ‘exporter’ operates under a DSM-spending budget constraint.,"Volume 16, Issue 3",August 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/3,96
"Following Taylor (Taylor, L.D., 1975, The demand for electricity: a survey,Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science 6, 74–110) and Houthakker (Houthakker, H.S., 1980, Residential electricity revisited, Energy Journal 1, 29–41), we estimate residential demand for electricity for five Southern states during 1981–1990 with the cross-sectionally correlated and time-wise autoregressive model (CSCTWA) that simultaneously takes into consideration heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, and spatial correlation that are likely to be detected when a pooled sample is used. There are a number of interesting findings. The CSCTWA model yields more efficient estimates with smaller standard errors than the OLS and the CSHTWA models. The price of natural gas is insignificant if the CSCTWA model is not considered. The log-linear form can not be rejected, whereas the linear form can be rejected. Thus, the elasticity of demand remains constant, but the slope is expected to vary.","Volume 16, Issue 3",August 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/3,96
"We develop a framework for thinking about the ‘paradox’ of very gradual diffusion of apparently cost-effective energy-conservation technologies. Our analysis provides some keys to understanding why this technology-diffusion process is gradual, and focuses attention on the factors that cause this to be the case, including those associated with potential market failures — information problems, principal/agent slippage, and unobserved costs — and those explanations that do not represent market failures — private information costs, high discount rates, and heterogeneity among potential adopters. Additionally, our analysis indicates how alternative policy instruments — both economic incentives and direct regulations — can hasten the diffusion of energy-conserving technologies.","Volume 16, Issue 2",May 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/2,97
"The uncertainty inherent in the exploration process requires that exploration firms try to estimate the results of future exploration in a region before making a commitment to explore. This paper discusses a recent approach derived from an approximation of the mean values of the non-central multivariate hypergeometric distribution. The approximation leads naturally to a differential equation model of the exploration process. A Taylor series expansion results in a polynomial in the discovery number usable as an estimate of the mean value of future discovery amounts. Further considerations suggest a third order polynomial whose coefficients are functions of the underlying geological and behavioral parameters. Linear regression, on data from three partially explored plays, was used to estimate the coefficients, and it produces forecasting models which perform well compared with two other widely used methods. The paper presents a derivation of the differential equation and the third order polynomial model, examples of its use for three plays in Western Canada, and an assessment of the forecasting ability of the model for these plays. The differential equation model is compared in terms of accuracy and bias to the exponential decline and the mean historical discovery rate models and found to produce superior forecasts.","Volume 16, Issue 2",May 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/2,97
This paper describes an empirical method for estimating the effect of expected prices on energy demand. Data for expected oil prices are compiled from forecasts for real oil prices. The effect of expectations on energy demand is simulated with an expectation variable that proxies the return on investment for energy efficient capital. Econometric results indicate that expected prices have a significant effect on energy demand in the US between 1975 and 1989. A model built from the econometric results indicates that the way in which consumers anticipate changes in energy prices that are generated by a carbon tax affects the quantity of emissions abated by the tax.,"Volume 16, Issue 2",May 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/2,97
"Electric utilities in the US are increasing their commitment to energy efficiency, spending over $1 billion on such programs in 1991. The question we address is: how quickly should energy efficiency programs be expanded? This is called the ‘ramp up’ problem. Although such programs have short lead times, significant inefficiencies can occur if they grow too quickly. This is because the capacity to install efficiency measures cannot be changed instantaneously. Staff must be hired and trained, while non-utility contractors must increase their capability. Management capabilities, such as database systems, must also be expanded. Adjustment costs also occur later as opportunities for inexpensive conservation are used up. Downsizing programs too quickly results in hardship for contractors and high employee severance costs.Optimal program expansion might spread the effort over more years in order to avoid the inefficiencies of a quick run-up and run-down. We present an optimal control framework for scheduling program expansion to maximize net benefits. Among the costs considered is the expense of altering program capacity. The variables that describe program status include staffing level and the number of potential installations that have already been made. The decisions that the utility makes are the number of installations, which is influenced by incentive levels and promotional efforts, and the change in capacity. This control problem is solved using dynamic programming. A simpler version of the problem can also be solved with a spreadsheet, permitting extensive sensitivity analysis. As examples, we present applications to the design of residential weatherization programs.","Volume 16, Issue 1",March 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/1,98
"Electric utilities face a variety of uncertainties that complicate their long-term resource planning. These uncertainties include future economic and load growths, fuel prices, environmental and economic regulations, performance of existing power plants, cost and availability of purchased power, and the costs and performance of new demand and supply resources. As utilities increasingly turn to demand-side management (DSM) programs to provide resources, it becomes more important to analyze the interactions between these programs and the uncertainties facing utilities.This paper uses a dynamic planning model to quantify the uncertainty effects of supply-only vs DSM+supply resource portfolios. The analysis considers four sets of uncertainties: economic growth, fuel prices, the costs to build new power plants, and the costs to operate DSM programs. The two types of portfolios are tested against these four sets of uncertainties for the period 1990 to 2010. Sensitivity, scenario, and worst-case analysis methods are used.The sensitivity analyses show that the DSM+supply resource portfolio is less sensitive to unanticipated changes in economic growth, fuel prices, and power-plant construction costs than is the supply-only portfolio. The supply-only resource mix is better only with respect to uncertainties about the costs of DSM programs.The base-case analysis shows that including DSM programs in the utility's resource portfolio reduces the net present value of revenue requirements (NPV-RR) by $490 million. The scenario-analysis results show an additional $30 million (6%) in benefits associated with reduction in these uncertainties. In the worst-case analysis, the DSM+supply portfolio again reduces the cost penalty associated with guessing wrong for both cases, when the utility plans for high needs and learns it has low needs and vice versa.","Volume 16, Issue 1",March 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/1,98
"This paper discusses the simultaneous effects of water scarcity and energy price increases on farm-level decisions such as water-related technology substitution and cropping patterns, and on groundwater quantity and quality, and farm income. A dynamic model is used. The model maximizes lomg-run private profits by incorporating dynamic relationships of water level and quality in aquifer, with management and technology change. The model is applied on a regional scale to conditions in Kern Country, California. This region has been hit by a six-year drought, and faces a proposed increase in electricity rates for agricultural-class customers. The simulation results suggest that over time, given the changes in water availability and energy prices, the proportion of groundwater in irrigation water will increase, cropping patterns will consist of higher shares of salt-tolerant crops, more energy and water saving pumping and irrigation equipment will replace existing technologies, agricultural net income will drop significantly, the level of groundwater in the aquifer will drop, and its quality will degrade. In extreme scenarios, agriculture may cease in locations depending heavily on groundwater.","Volume 16, Issue 1",March 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/1,98
"The Sudan, along with all Sahelian countries, faces urgent environmental problems caused, in part, by the clear-cutting of scrub for firewood. In this paper, we analyze the economic consequences of a policy often proposed to reduce the consumption of firewood. Specifically, we simulate the policy of introducing more efficient wood burning stoves into households by using an Applied General Equilibrium (AGE) model. The results indicate that the anticipated reduction in the economy-wide demand for wood, based on the increase in the technical efficiency of the stoves, is not fully realized.","Volume 16, Issue 1",March 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/16/issue/1,98
"Factor supply shortage is a common problem faced by a firm. Solutions for allocating the limited supply include rationing, interruption and pricing. While previous research has examined the welfare losses generated by each solution, there is little evidence on their relative magnitudes within a common framework. The objective of this paper is to specify a model of firm behaviour under service interruption to estimate the welfare loss of service interruption. The same model is used to estimate the loss due to a price increase intended to resolve a supply shortage. Using water consumption data collected for Hong Kong, we find that relative to pricing, service interruption is inefficient for water shortage management.","Volume 15, Issue 4",December 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/15/issue/4,99

"Recently, politicians in various countries propose and support Pigouvian taxes to combat environmental pollution. A feature central to all these otherwise different proposals is the taxation of fossil fuels. In particular, it is often argued that the financial loss is small for the consumers because these tax revenues allow to lower other, e.g. income, taxes. This conclusion, however, neglects potential strategic reactions of non-competitive energy suppliers. This paper studies a non-cooperative game between a benevolent and taxing government versus a non-competitive and profit maximizing energy supply cartel. In particular, it will be shown that energy taxes may raise the import price of energy, e.g., because taxation increases the (relative) gains from cartelization.","Volume 15, Issue 3",September 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/15/issue/3,100

"This study investigates two issues related to property tax relief and the preservation of prime agricultural land; (a) the extent to which state circuit-breaker tax credits are capitalized into land values and (b) the circuit-breakers' effects in preventing the transition of land from farming to developed uses. Using cross-section data for the years 1980–1983 for the circuit breaker programs in Michigan, models of land values and participation rates are estimated. The results provide evidence that the property tax credits are partially capitalized into property value and that the circuit-breakers do not effectively retard the flow of land into urban use.","Volume 15, Issue 3",September 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/15/issue/3,100
"In time-of-use (TOU) pricing schemes, utilities charge rates that depend on the time of day and the season of the year at which electricity is used. Estimates of the effects of TOU rates on business customers in the US and Israel have differed widely; however, the actual response by business customers in the aggregate is very small. Most firms do not appear to respond at all, but those that do respond make substantial adjustments to newly introduced TOU rates. In this paper we show that adjustment costs associated with changing the level of employment can explain the observed pattern of behavior in the US and Israel. We develop a model that predicts whether a firm will respond to the introduction of TOU rates, and show that the ‘average’ firm in the US and Israel is unlikely to respond to the current TOU rate schedules. Moreover, the more often the price structure changes during the year, the less likely are firms employing only one labor shift to respond. We apply our model to TOU rates in the US and Israel and show that it predicts the actual response to these rates quite well.","Volume 15, Issue 3",September 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/15/issue/3,100

"This paper applies the money metric approximation to the Hicksian equivalent variation and the generalized logit model of consumer demand to the analysis of the welfare effects of end-use efficiency improvements in various electricity conservation options. The results are compared with the standard cost-effectiveness criterion based on the net present value of energy conservation investments. If the assumptions implicit in the use of this criterion hold, namely, zero end-use price and income elasticities, the net present value of an investment will be the same as the money equivalent of the net welfare change calculated by the money metric. However, the standard net present value becomes less accurate as a measure of welfare change as the end-use price and income elasticities differ significantly from zero. The money metric welfare change measure is theoretically more accurate. It is also more general since it encompasses cases where the above assumptions of the net present value criterion do not hold, i.e, net present value is a special case of the money metric.","Volume 15, Issue 2",June 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/15/issue/2,101
"This paper presents the results of a dynamic nonlinear programming model of a mineral resource market with several features: heterogenous quality in the mineral, links with related product markets, incorporation of institutional constraints, resource allocations for each year in the planning period, and analysis of outcomes under various severance tax rates. The model computes privately efficient competitive use paths to perform cost-benefit analysis of public mineral policies. Policy variables are evaluated for their impact on both private behavior and public benefits. The application is to New Mexico's linked coal and electric power markets. Findings reveal that scarcity rents are currently 4% of coal's price, and peak at 27% in 43 years. Increasing the present $1/ton New Mexico severance tax to $11 reduces current annual coal output by 25% prolongs the life of the state's coal industry by three years, and increases discounted severance tax revenues by 850% or $4.2 billion.","Volume 15, Issue 2",June 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/15/issue/2,101

"This paper describes research we conducted as part of Energy Modeling Forum 12, a recent study of the costs of limiting carbon dioxide emissions organized by the Energy Modeling Forum at Stanford University. It discusses how our approach differed from that of other participants in EMF-12 and presents several important findings. In particular, we show that in the United States the effects of a carbon tax will be very similar to the effects of a tax placed solely on coal. Outside the coal sector, the principal effect of carbon tax will be to raise the cost of electricity and to shift base load electric generating capacity toward fuels other than coal. At the aggregate level, higher energy prices will cause gross national product to fall unless the revenue from tax is used to reduce high marginal tax rates elsewhere in the economy.","Volume 15, Issue 1",March 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/15/issue/1,102

"For national environmental problems, appropriately designed emission taxes lead to efficient outcomes. The paper gives an analysis of the properties of an international tax on CO2 emissions. A uniform CO2 tax for all countries does not necessarily give the first best social optimum. In practice, however, a uniform tax at an appropriate level will give an allocation of emissions which is very close to the allocation in the first-best optimum. CO2 emissions affect the climate through cumulative emissions. In a dynamic game of CO2 emissions, it is shown that the tax giving a Pareto optimal solution is the same for the open loop and the perfect equilibrium, in spite of the fact that these two equilibria differ in the absence of a CO2 tax.","Volume 15, Issue 1",March 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/15/issue/1,102
"In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of optimal carbon control strategies to parameters of the Carbon Emissions Trajectory Assessment (CETA) Model, and we use CETA in a simple decision tree framework to estimate the value of information about global warming uncertainties. We find that if an optimal control policy is used under uncertainty, the eventual resolution of uncertainty has high value relative to current research budgets, and resolving uncertainty about the costs of warming is nearly as important as resolving uncertainty about the extent of warming. In addition, we find that there is not a high premium on immediate resolution of uncertainty, if resolution would otherwise occur within, say, twenty years; this implies that time is available to plan and execute a carefully designed research program. On the other hand, we find that if the real world political process would result in a suboptimal control policy being chosen under uncertainty, and this choice could be prevented by early resolution of uncertainty, the benefit of early resolution may be as much as three orders of magnitude greater.","Volume 15, Issue 1",March 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/15/issue/1,102

"This paper examines the efficiency and equity implications of alternative assignments of marketable permits for carbon dioxide. A non-linear programming model is used to estimate the net welfare changes of permit allocations based on Sovereignty and Rawlsian equity criteria for 8 countries/regions covering the spectrum of economic development levels.The net welfare gains associated with an overall 20% reduction in CO2 emissions are estimated to be nearly $20 billion, an increase of several billion dollars over a system of inflexible emission quotas requiring 20% abatement in each country. Also, although the welfare changes implied by alternative permit assignments may vary greatly between countries before trading, the trading process significantly reduces the disparities. This result stems from the Coase Theorem, which implies a uniquely efficient outcome. That is, individual country abatement levels and hence, costs, are the same under all permit assignments after trading, and net welfare for a given nation differs only by the amount of permit revenues/expenditures associated with the application of alternative equity criteria.Foremost among the paper's policy implications is that although equity criteria may differ significantly in principle, their welfare implications in practice may be very similar for various subsets of these criteria. This should reduce tensions at the bargaining table and facilitate the negotiation of greenhouse gas agreements.","Volume 15, Issue 1",March 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resource-and-energy-economics/vol/15/issue/1,102

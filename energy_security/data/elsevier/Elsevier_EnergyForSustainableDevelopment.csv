"In recent years, deployment of standalone electricity systems to provide energy access in a rural context has increased rapidly. These systems typically incorporating variable renewables alongside electrical energy storage for consistent supply, and operate at a range of scales to provide a range of services. However, there has been relatively little analysis of storage technology choices made by providers of these systems, how this varies by application, how these are influenced by priorities of providers, and how these choices could be improved. Here, we present findings from a series of interviews with providers of off grid energy solutions on choice and availability of technologies, supply chains, realised costs, technology performance, environmental impact, and anticipated impact of future technology development. Based upon these, we make recommendations for regulators and individual companies on how technology choices and life cycle management could be improved.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/48/suppl/C,1
"The energy transition is a challenge that affects regions on various scales. This paper presents the economic chances of deploying the renewable energy technology solar photovoltaic in a German region. Total regional economic effects of 280 PV plants, installed in 2014 with a cumulative capacity of 3.7 MW, lead to a regional value added of approximately €3.8 million (€1019/kW installed, €57/MWh electricity generated) and employment effects of 42 full-time person years (11 person years/MW installed), occurring from 2014 to 2034. The avoided greenhouse gas emissions of these plants are 2365 tons CO2 equivalents per year (0.7 kgCO2-eq/kWh generated) and the avoided air pollution is 0.97 tSO2 per year, 1.48 tNOx per year, and 0.07 t NMVOCs per year in 2014. The total economic effects of regional value added, avoided CO2 emissions, and avoided air pollution per year in 2014 range from €0.8 million - €1 million or (€208–€277 per kW installed, €231–€307 per MWh electricity generated).",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/48/suppl/C,1
"The aim of this research is to study the potential association between the reduction in electricity consumption in Line 2 – Green of the São Paulo Subway and the change of the Train Control System from the “fixed block” type to the “moving block” type. Most of the previous studies published on energy efficiency at subways and trains are simulation studies and only a few based on empirical data. The statistical approach was chosen because there is no installed equipment to directly measure this influence, since the energy consumption is measured at the entrances of the System and there is no individual measurement of each train. The study of the relationships among the variables that potentially influence energy efficiency was performed by means of a multivariate regression. The results of the regression generated an equation model with significance for the variables: type of system, proportion of use of the fleets (particularly the proportion of more modern trains) and the number of trips made. In the regression process, the stepwise method was used and some variables were withdrawn when verifying that they had multicollinearity. The data extracted from the communication protocol were not used in the regression, but they did allow verifying an evidence of improvement in the speed profiles and also a reduction in the number of stops that the train made in the route, indicating a smaller interference between the train movements with the new system. The calculated savings obtained by the new system was around 2.8%, achieving 7.8% on average when the new fleet was included, which only uses the “moving block” system.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"Solar Photovoltaic systems are widely accepted as alternate energy sources across the world. Grid Tied PV (GTPV) and Grid Interactive (GIPV) PV systems are the two configurations in which PV generation is integrated with Grid. Later is more complex due to inclusion of battery as storage and connected load, along with Grid import/export. In this paper, performance of a 40 kWp GIPV system, installed in India, is presented. The system under study comprises of PV, Grid, and Battery bank and connected load. Performance parameters like reference yield, array yield, final yield, performance ratio, and capacity factor are derived using standards IEC 61724. Also presented is Annual energy yield of the plant and Annual efficiencies of PV array, inverter and system. The effect of temperature on PV array and inverter performance is also evaluated. All these parameters are evaluated from real time annual data.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"In the present work, we report results of operational testing of a rooftop stand-alone solar photovoltaic (SA-SPV) system of capacity 6.75 kWp over a period of one year. The performance is measured in terms of daily energy yield from SPV array, daily energy output from the battery energy storage (BES) and the inverter. The system's gross annual energy yield is 6069.68 kWh, and corresponding daily average energy yield is 16.58 kWh/day. The annual average reference yield, array yield and final yield of the system are 5.47 h/d, 2.44 h/d and 2.38 h/d, respectively. The annual performance ratio (PR) and capacity utilization factor (CUF) of the system are computed as 43.58% and 10.24%, respectively.

"The Fruit And Vegetable Energy (FAVE) model was developed to quantify the energy budget and fossil CO2 emissions in this paper. The energy terms considered were fieldwork, irrigation, on-farm cooling, farm building maintenance, off-farm transport, and N fertilizer supply, with an estimate of farm machinery supply energy integrated with the farm fieldwork energy CO2 emission intensity estimates. The 31 vegetable crops and 18 fruit crops identified in the socio-economic Canadian data base (CANSIM) were divided into six vegetable groups and five fruit groups, along with potatoes. The data provided by the 1996 Farm Energy Use Survey (FEUS) and the guidance provided by two grower focus groups were essential to the development of this model. Total energy use in Canada between 2007 and 2016 was 2.3 PJ by the vegetable industry and 2.32 PJ by the fruit industry. These included 0.77 PJ for fieldwork, 1.05 PJ for irrigation, 0.36 PJ for on-farm coolers, 0.67 PJ for farm building maintenance, 0.70 PJ for off-farm transport and 1.07 PJ for fertilizer supply. The FAVE model was used to determine the fossil CO2 emission intensities of 12 individual crops.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"Rural energy consumption is an important component of national energy consumption and plays an important role in rural areas and ecological environment developments. This paper investigated energy structure and energy usage behavior in rural areas of northern China based on the analysis of large-scale field survey data. The energy consumption structure is composed of the biomass energy and commercial energy, supplemented by two kinds of mutual use of the way. And Low efficient energy usage and poor indoor environment are major problems in this area. Therefore, the reason for the excessive energy consumption is poor thermal performance of construction, lack of planning standards and low energy efficiency. This paper provides new insights for north China's rural energy consumption, it can also provide detail and real data for the local decision makers and other stakeholders to promote energy-saving policy.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"Are lucrative charcoal markets in Africa reducing poverty for people in the trade? In spite of its economic significance, the extent to which charcoal income reduces poverty is debatable. This article applies commodity-chain analysis to Ghana's charcoal commodity chain to describe the characteristics of actors, and to quantify and explain the profits reaped by the different actors in the chain. We estimate that profits of US$66 million are generated annually. The distribution is highly skewed between and within actor groups, with 22% of profits reaped by merchants, who make up only 3% of the actors in the market. The majority of producers and retailers, by far the largest groups in the sector generate incomes below the national minimum wage. Women dominate the market in terms of number of persons involved. Women and men earn equal incomes at all levels of the market except at the production level, where men reap higher profits than women. People from several ethnic groups engage in the market, but members of the Sissala and Asante ethnic groups are the most frequently encountered ones throughout the chain. Improving equity along the charcoal chain will require breaking the interlocking credit-labor arrangement that enables merchants to have control over charcoal prices, and improving producers' access to urban markets. The paper makes policy recommendations in this regard.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"Over 90% of the rural population in sub-Saharan Africa still relies on fuelwood as their primary source of household energy. In this context, recent robust data on fuelwood consumption in rural areas are needed to conceive and implement appropriate energy policies. This paper identifies the factors that determine fuelwood consumption variability in two villages in Burkina Faso, based on a two-year survey of 60 rural households of different size and wealth status. The women who made up the panel were surveyed at five-day intervals over a period of three months in the rainy season, one month in the cold dry season and one month in the hot dry season. Our results corroborate some fuelwood consumption patterns in rural SSA: fuelwood consumption per adult equivalent decreases both with the size of the household and with local wood scarcity. Conversely, it challenges the idea that the level of consumption is correlated with the level of household wealth. Finally, the most important result is that the scarcity of wood resources leads people to buy fuelwood from outside and adopt strategies to reduce their consumption by reducing the number of cooking cycles and certainly by wasting less energy, whatever the level of household wealth.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"The performance of a hybrid hydrokinetic turbine rotor under different operating conditions is investigated in this study. The effects of radius ratio and attachment angle on the power coefficient, self-starting capability and flow behavior around the turbine were simulated using commercially available software, ANSYS, with FLUENT as the solver. Realizable k-ε turbulence model has been used to solve the unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations. We compared the performance of a hybrid hydrokinetic turbine with the identically designed hybrid wind turbine under similar input power conditions. The hydrokinetic turbine rotor showed better performance than that of wind turbine rotor. The maximum values of coefficient of power (CP) and torque (CT) occur at attachment angles of 30° and 60° for a radius ratio of 0.2. At an attachment angle of 90°, fluctuations in CT were minimized.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"This article analyzes the measured results of 1.4 kWP grid connected photovoltaic plant. The facility is located in College of Engineering renewable energy research lab, Sultan Qaboos University, Oman. The aim of this study is to analyze the desert type PV performance under Muscat governorate climate conditions. The system was monitored since April 2012 and the generated energy was fed into grid through the low voltage supply. Various performance parameters of the PV system were evaluated which include efficiencies (PV module, system and inverter), performance ratio, capacity factor, and different types of PV system losses and yields. The maximum values of recorded ambient temperature, daytime PV module temperature, and solar radiation, were 48.7 °C and 69.14 °C in June, and 1344 W/m2 in March, respectively.The experimental results show that the total measured annual energy produced was 2217.6 kWh whereas the annual average daily reference yield, array yield, and final yield were 6.36 kWh/kWP-day, 4.56 kWh/kWP-day, and 4.10 kWh/kWP-day, respectively. The average annual performance ratio and capacity factor were 0.65 and 0.17 respectively while the annual average system efficiency, module efficiency, and inverter efficiency were 15%, 17.2%, and 91%, respectively. Furthermore, the average annual capture losses, system losses, and cell temperature losses were 1.8 h/day, 0.47 h/day, and 0.27 h/day, respectively. The findings from this study are providing useful information to policy makers and others about the performance of desert type PV system in Oman. The influence of the dust on the energy output and efficiency are presented. It was found that for the desert type PV, the reduction in energy production was 10% when the modules left uncleaned.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"As one of the most cost-effective means of carbon emission reduction, carbon tax has attracted considerable attention from economists and international organizations. This study applied a two-region dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to discover how differentiated carbon taxes among regions would affect the competitiveness of local industries, taking an inland city—Chongqing in China—as an example. The results show that when carbon tax is implemented, it can effectively decrease carbon emissions and intensity, and achieve China's Nationally Determined Contribution target by 2030. It will, however, also have varied effects on the macroeconomy, with GDP losses of 1.54% to 2.5%. Meanwhile, industrial competitiveness in Chongqing will be affected heterogeneously. When Chongqing's tax level is higher than the rest of China, agriculture, textile, food, transport equipment, machinery, and electronics sectors will benefit from increased output activity. Meanwhile, paper, chemicals, nonmetal production, and metal smelting will suffer output losses. Such varied sectoral effects can be explained by two effects—price effect and scale effect—in three markets: domestic, interprovincial, and foreign. Finally, based on China's practical situation, this paper makes policy suggestions that could mitigate the negative effects of carbon tax.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"This work provides empirical evidence of social and environmental impacts of the production phase of charcoal in Liberia, West Africa. It helps address a gap in information for stakeholders and establishes a baseline for more focused research and interventions efforts for the country's sector.Charcoal is often perceived as a maligned part of the energy ladder, mainly due to the environmental and health effects of its end use. This fuel is generally a small part of energy policies or left out altogether. Main efforts to curtail its impacts are aimed at reducing its use. The hope is that households will move away from this fuel all together. But evidence shows that cultural preference, socio-economic factors, and flaws in the concept of the energy ladder will ensure charcoal continues to be a significant part of the energy portfolio in Sub-Saharan Africa.The production phase of the fuel has received little attention particularly when considering the large environmental and social impacts faced by producers. In Liberia, where over 90% of the urban population depends on this fuel, very little is known about the situation faced by producers and the impacts resulting from it. The research team surveyed producers in key charcoal-production areas of Liberia and interviewed stakeholders from governmental and non-profit agencies.Results show that a majority of survey respondents do not replant when harvesting for production and use traditional earth mound kilns. Child labor and physical injury were common among respondents. Gender disparities and a lack of institutional support or formalization of the industry were identified. Policies aimed at the production phase of charcoal are generally absent in the country.Further research is needed to fully understand the situation in Liberia and more engagement with producers will be key. However, these initial findings point to the need for focused attention on the production phase of the fuel and attempt to fill the gap of available data from the field.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"This study investigated the status of Jatropha plants farming for biodiesel production in Rwanda. A total of 73 Jatropha farmers from five sectors namely, Kigarama, Kigina, Kirehe, Mahama and Nyamugali in Kirehe district, Eastern Province, were selected. The study examined eight key parameters that determine the status of Jatropha plants farming. These parameters are classification of Jatropha farmers, methods for Jatropha plants growing, government strategy on providing Jatropha quality seeds or seedlings to farmers, government involvement to initiate local farmers to cultivate Jatropha plants for biodiesel production, knowledge level of the farmers on Jatropha plants farming, Jatropha seeds yield, perception level of investing on Jatropha plants farming and opinions of the key players in the biodiesel project. Through interviews and questionnaires, information was gathered and analysed using both qualitative and quantitative methods.Result indicates that majority of the farmers (82%) in the five sectors reported that they were farming Jatropha plants as individual farmers while about 18% indicated that they were cultivating Jatropha plants as cooperatives. Majority of the farmers (70%) used agro-forestry farming technique due to shortage of farm lands. It was also revealed that most of the farmers (55%) have little knowledge on growing Jatropha plants. With regards to farmers using quality Jatropha seeds or seedlings, most farmers (93%) indicated that the government has not provided Jatropha seeds or seedlings. On the other hand, majority of the farmers (80%) stated that there have been very low involvements of the government to initiate farmers to cultivate Jatropha plants for biodiesel production project.In terms of Jatropha seeds yield, majority of the farmers (63%) in the five sectors rated Jatropha seed production level as low (between 1.1 and 2.9 t/ha/year) while about 33% stated that it was very low (between 0 and 1 t/ha/year). This was attributed to lack of reliable markets, low level of sensitisation, lack of preliminary studies on suitable areas for Jatropha plantation, lack of policy and institutional framework on biofuels, shortage of farm lands for intensification of Jatropha framing and low soil adaptation of the Jatropha plants. Due to low production level and lack of reliable markets, 71% of the total respondents considered Jatropha plants farming as a very low investment.Since there is no biodiesel production at the moment which would have created a reliable market for Jatropha seeds, Jatropha farming for biodiesel production in Rwanda is not viable. It is recommended that the government should carry out a feasibility study to generate knowledge on growth performance of various Jatropha species under the prevailing environmental conditions. In addition, due to shortage of land farms, the government should undertake economic assessment of growing Jatropha trees as hedges.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"In this work, ensiling of Festuca arundinacea (Tall Fescue, TF) prior to biogas production was studied and the effect of storage time, additives (pilot-scale trial) and mechanical pretreatment (full-scale trials) were investigated. In the pilot-scale test, TF was ensiled by adding two biological additives and stored for up to 9 months. In the full-scale test, two 7 ton TF piles (unchopped and chopped) were ensiled for 3 months. Both the ultimate CH4 potential and silage products were measured to evaluate the effect of ensiling. Results show that ensiling of TF resulted in well-preserved silages with low pH for most of the variants stored for up to nine months. The biological additives contained both hetero- and homo-fermentative lactic acid bacteria and enzymes showed a positive effect on both organic dry matter (ODM) preservation and biogas production. Full-scale ensiling presented silage quality with higher ODM losses if the grass is not cut prior to the ensiling process. In general, ensiling is an appropriate storage method for TF, allowing it to be used as a long-term feedstock for biogas plants.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"The metal kiln with heat distribution pipes is a new design of charcoal kiln for high quality charcoal and wood vinegar production. It was made of sheet steel. Its body was covered with fiberglass and galvanized steel as an insulator with the size of 1.5 m height and 2 m diameter. There were six exhaust chimneys connecting to a condenser unit for wood vinegar condensation. A raw material for testing efficiency of charcoal production was bamboo. The metal kiln contained about 1446 kg of bamboo with a moisture content of 30%. The process used 279 kg fire wood. It took 27 h for heating up to >600 °C, and cooled down naturally within 15 h. The products were 315 kg bamboo charcoal, 12 kg ash, and 900 L crude bamboo vinegar. There was no unburnt bamboo. In other words they were 24% good bamboo charcoal, 0% unburnt bamboo and 1% ash. Bamboo charcoal characterization followed the ASTM D7582-15 and ASTM D5865-10. Bamboo charcoal showed 8.5% moisture content, 7.7% volatile matters, 81% fixed carbon, 11.3% ash and 30,347 kJ kg−1 heat values.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"In Morocco, Law 58/2015 has legalized the connection of photovoltaic systems on the low-voltage grid and the country should probably be adopting the net-metering approach. Since the electricity distributor should only buy a small part of the electricity injected, system over-sizing becomes critical for the investor. In these conditions, it is critical to know the photovoltaic yield generated at any specific Moroccan location. The objective of this study consists on calculating, generating and drawing precise maps of grid-connected photovoltaic DC yields for three silicon technologies (monocrystalline, polycrystalline and amorphous) for all Morocco. For this, (i) we have measured and collected 2466 daily DC yields spread over 20 sites for each of the three technologies and validated three models matching the experimental measurements. Then, (ii) we have selected 1392 representative points covering all Morocco (resolution 0.25°) for which, the three validated models gave the long-term average of photovoltaic DC yields using appropriated input data from Solar Med Atlas. And finally, (iii) we have drawn the long term monthly average of daily PV DC yields maps with the help of ArcGIS set up to use the ordinary kriging method to interpolate between the 1392 points.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"This paper briefly discusses the present framework and status of Indian power market and guides through the possible adaptations to accommodate the growing renewable energy (RE) integration into the grid. The participation of RE generators in the wholesale energy market would provide them a platform to optimally manage their generation portfolio which would help them in compensating the high investment cost. The increased competition in the market would eventually bring down the electricity price. The objective of this paper is to identify an ideal framework and optimal bidding mechanism for RE generators (wind energy in particular) to maximize the overall capital gain (social welfare) in the Indian power market. The inputs from various foreign electricity markets having high wind energy penetration have been considered. Recent studies suggest that battery energy storage system (BESS) can play a significant role in handling risks associated with the uncertainties in wind power generation and thus can help in maximizing the revenue for wind farm owners. It can also be instrumental in active/reactive power balancing which will further help in the frequency regulation. The paper probes into the combined wind and battery energy trading, and various bidding strategies in the day-ahead market (DAM), intraday energy market, real-time balancing, and other ancillary markets.",Volume 47,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/47/suppl/C,2
"Approximately 3 billion people, most of whom live in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, rely on solid fuels (i.e. wood, crop wastes, dung, charcoal) and kerosene for their cooking needs. Exposure to household air pollution from burning these fuels is estimated to account for approximately 3 million premature deaths a year. Cleaner fuels – such as liquefied petroleum gas, biogas, electricity, and certain compressed biomass fuels – have the potential to alleviate much of this significant health burden. A wide variety of clean cooking intervention programs are being implemented around the world, but very few of these efforts have been analyzed to enable global learning. The Clean Cooking Implementation Science Network (ISN), supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and partners, identified the need to augment the publicly available literature concerning what has worked well and in what context. The ISN has supported the development of a systematic set of case studies, contained in this Special Issue, examining clean cooking program rollouts in a variety of low- and middle-income settings around the world. We used the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adaptation, implementation, maintenance) framework to coordinate and evaluate the case studies. This paper describes the clean cooking case studies project, introduces the individual studies contained herein, and proposes a general conceptual model to support future planning and evaluation of household energy programs.","Volume 46, Pages 1-122 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/46/suppl/C,3
"The National Biodigester Program (NBP) was established in 2006 to build and maintain household biodigesters in Cambodia. In its first six years, the program installed almost 20,000 biodigesters and established an in-country network of local financiers, construction companies, skilled masons, bioslurry specialists and after-care technicians accessible to rural users in 14 of 24 Cambodian provinces. Since its initial success, the program's adoption rates have stalled despite increasing government support and high rates of user satisfaction. Building on an initial evaluation of the NBP in 2013, this updated assessment identifies multiple changes in its second implementation phase that have undermined the initial momentum of the program. Abrupt interruptions in institutional support, deteriorating supply side services (access to construction agents, masons, repair services) and reduced access to credit for farmers have eroded the service network that the first implementation phase established. Structural changes in the rural economy may also contribute to declining demand. Government support to another biodigester program which offers a lower investment price, but does not provide after-sales services, has also undercut the long-term implementation strategy of the NBP. The paper finds that despite these programmatic changes, the installed biodigesters continue to perform according to expectation and to be maintained and valued by their users, but the future viability of the program remains uncertain.","Volume 46, Pages 1-122 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/46/suppl/C,3
"This paper analyses the Africa Biogas Partnership Program (ABPP) in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. ABPP was established in 2009 to promote adoption of biodigesters by rural households in sub-Saharan Africa. We use the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation, Adoption, Maintenance) with information from literature, internal documents, primary data from user surveys and interviews with sector stakeholders.ABPP was implemented with the primary objective of establishing viable biodigester markets. By 2017, Kenya made most progress toward commercial viability, evidenced by market entry of companies offering prefabricated digesters and establishment of 22 marketing hubs, which link rural organizations with local construction enterprises and finance institutions. In Uganda 5 marketing hubs were established and in Tanzania 7. Between 2009 and 2017 over 27,000 households installed a biodigester, half of them in Kenya. Additional objectives include improving agricultural productivity by using bio-slurry, improving health, reducing deforestation, and improving livelihoods.Households perceive higher crop yields (84%–91% of users), reduced fuel consumption (84%–94% of users), reduced eye problems and respiratory symptoms (45%–91% of users). Benefits most appreciated are “easy cooking” and “saving time and money”. Fuel consumption tests show households with biodigesters use 2.1 to 3.3 fewer tons of wood per year than similar households without biodigesters.The ABPP case study suggests that the program has created a nascent biodigester market in East Africa. The country programs have been dynamic and adaptive, moving along the cycle of market development; however, many challenges remain. For example, while half of the adopters in Kenya exclusively use biogas for cooking, in Uganda and Tanzania fuel stacking is more prevalent, making it more difficult to achieve health and environmental objectives. In addition, high upfront cost, limited access to credit, and lack of maintenance present challenges. In 2016, 27% of biodigesters constructed between 2009 and 2013 were not working. In response, ABPP implemented call centers and launched campaigns to repair non-functioning plants. To ensure long-term viability and increase the likelihood of achieving environmental and health goals, we suggest deeper engagement with governmental and non-governmental stakeholders and a targeted campaign promoting exclusive use.","Volume 46, Pages 1-122 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/46/suppl/C,3
"This paper reviews the experience of a for-profit firm in Rwanda promoting biomass pellets and a fan micro-gasification improved cookstove as a clean cooking alternative to charcoal. Consumers purchase locally produced biomass pellets and receive the improved cookstove on a lease basis. The cost of the pellets and stove(s) is lower than the cost of cooking with charcoal in the urban setting where our study takes place. Inyenyeri has been piloting its business model since 2012. Using data from an ongoing quantitative impact evaluation study, focus group discussions, and a series of key informant interviews, we chronicle the firm's experience with stove choice, pellet production, and marketing, highlighting lessons for the design of private sector-led clean cooking interventions.We find that 38% of households marketed to as part of our ongoing impact evaluation study adopted the pellet and stove system, but that approximately 45% of those who adopted suspended contracts after signing up. The firm's experience with stove choice, pellet production, pricing structures, and customer service strategies have influenced implementation, adoption rates, and scale-up. Customer preferences for specific stove attributes and willingness of stove manufacturers to modify stoves for local conditions have influenced both the firm's choice of stove and customer satisfaction. In 2015 the firm transitioned customers from the Philips stove to the Mimi Moto, a decision which created confusion among consumers, and affected adoption rates. Despite the challenge of establishing and scaling-up pellet production in central Africa, the firm increased production 400% between 2014 and 2017 to reach 800,000 kg/year. Importing and maintaining pelletizing equipment in Rwanda is costly, the supply of feedstock irregualar, and undercapitalization of the firm have affected production. With respect to marketing, after experimenting with a sign-up fee and a minimum monthly purchase of pellets, the firm has decided to transition to a pay-as-you-go system to reduce perceived risk by consumers. A high-level of customer service including in-home visits, free in-home repair, and home delivery of pellets are major innovations. The long pilot phase and the evolutionary nature of the firm's activities illustrate both the complexity of building a market for clean cooking, and the time required to understand nascent markets and consumer demand.","Volume 46, Pages 1-122 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/46/suppl/C,3
"Recent national strategic plans in China have set renewable energy targets for rural household energy programs, including those that advance the production of densified biomass fuels (e.g. pellets, briquettes) for use in household cooking and heating stoves. There is presently very little information on potential barriers to the successful development of densified biomass for household cooking and heating in China, but such knowledge may be informative in settings that aim to replace unprocessed coal and other polluting fuels with renewable, cleaner-burning energy sources. We designed a case study to coordinate data-gathering efforts at rural field sites in southwestern Sichuan province and northeastern Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, where production of densified biomass fuels is under development for household end-users. We conducted interviews with factory personnel, local administrative leaders, and sector experts involved in the production and distribution of densified fuel, including pellets and briquettes, for household use. Results from our qualitative textual data analysis yielded several recommendations for improving development of densified biomass fuels for household end-use. These included reducing heterogeneity of feedstocks, increasing financial support for operational costs (e.g. collection, transport, and storage of raw materials; storage and distribution of final products), improving household perceptions of and subsequent demand for densified biomass fuels, and increasing enforcement of national and provincial policies banning the use of coal and open-field biomass burning. Collection and storage of raw materials and the final densified fuel product were consistently noted as critical challenges to scaling up production at all three sites. Finally, the perspectives of factory managers and local village administrators that we present also indicated that production of densified biomass fuels would most likely be more successful and reproducible in places where national-level policies are viewed as obligatory.","Volume 46, Pages 1-122 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/46/suppl/C,3
"BackgroundApproximately 80% of Ethiopia's energy consumption is dominated by woody biomass fuel use, resulting in 91.2 million tons of firewood and 4.2 million tons of charcoal consumed annually. Ethiopia's dependency on non-sustainable energy, especially for cooking, has been a major concern for the nation for the past 30 years, contributing to deforestation, climate change, and adverse human health impacts.ObjectivesOur objective was to document the work of Gaia Association and the implementation of the ethanol CleanCook stove in the refugee camp and urban settings of Ethiopia. We then assessed the potential for the scale-up of ethanol as a household fuel.MethodsWe utilized the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of the ethanol cookstove intervention. We obtained secondary data from a variety of sources to evaluate a.) The performance of the CleanCook ethanol stove; b.) Effectiveness of the ethanol cookstove implementation; and, c.) Barriers to scale-up and commercialization of ethanol use as a household fuel. In addition, we conducted primary analysis of qualitative surveys to evaluate the perceptions of the ethanol and adoption of the CleanCook stove.ResultsOur case study results provide critical insight into the 13-year implementation of the CleanCook ethanol stove in Ethiopia. Laboratory tests demonstrate that the CleanCook stove reduces harmful emissions compared to biomass stoves, and preliminary field tests show 24-hour average PM2.5 levels of 200 μg/m3. To-date 8731 CleanCook stoves were distributed to refugee households, while an additional 500 were sold at a subsided price to low-income urban households. CleanCook stove users report the continued use of multiple stoves.ConclusionsThe CleanCook ethanol stove has been implemented as an energy intervention for the vulnerable refugee population in Ethiopia for over 13 years. There has been limited success of a subsidized CleanCook stove among low-income households in Addis Ababa. This case study demonstrates the complexities of promoting a new fuel for household cooking, and the numerous obstacles and stagnations in implementation. Ethanol demonstrates some potential for scale-up and commercialization as a household fuel in Addis Ababa, but it may require simultaneous stabilization of ethanol supply, growth of a city-wide distribution infrastructure, and an affordably priced stove and fuel.","Volume 46, Pages 1-122 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/46/suppl/C,3
"A recently completed randomized controlled study in Nigeria that transitioned pregnant women from traditional fuels to ethanol in their cook stoves demonstrated improved pregnancy outcomes in mothers and children. We subsequently conducted a pilot study of 30 households in Lagos, Nigeria, to determine the acceptability of blended ethanol/methanol as cooking fuel and willingness to pay for the CleanCook stove. A third of the pilot participants expressed a willingness to purchase the stove for the minimum price of 42 USD or more. Fuel sales data suggest sustained, but non-exclusive, use of the CleanCook stove. These results will influence the final design and implementation of a planned 2500 stove commercial pilot that is scheduled to start in Nigeria in August 2018.","Volume 46, Pages 1-122 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/46/suppl/C,3
"BackgroundIn 2007, the Indonesian Government instigated a national program to convert domestic kerosene users to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking. This was primarily motivated by the rising cost of kerosene subsidies.ObjectiveTo review the national conversion program and LPG scale up by evaluating its impacts, including assessing sustained changes in cooking behaviour and consequent reductions in exposure to household air pollution (HAP).Methods and data sourcesSearches of peer-review and grey literature in both English and Bahasa Indonesian were conducted and supplemented by interviews with key informants, data from the National Statistics Agency and results from household surveys. The data were extracted and analyzed using an Implementation Science approach.ResultsThe main kerosene to LPG conversion phase took place in highly populated kerosene dependent areas between 2007 and 2012 reaching over 50 million households, approximately two thirds of all households in Indonesia. Since then the drive to expand LPG use has continued at a slower pace, especially in more remote provinces where solid fuel is more widely used. Over 57 million LPG start up kits were distributed as of 2015. Beginning in 2018, the open subsidy for LPG is expected to be replaced by one targeted at lower income households. While the main conversion phase has been highlighted as an example of effective and impressively fast fuel switching at scale, the impact on domestic biomass use remains limited.ConclusionsAddressing HAP and the health impacts associated with kerosene and biomass use was never an objective of the program. Consequently, there is limited evidence of impact in this area, and in hindsight, missed opportunities in terms of influencing cooking behaviour change among biomass users, who are more at risk.","Volume 46, Pages 1-122 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/46/suppl/C,3
"IntroductionOver 80% of rural households in Peru use solid fuels as their primary source of domestic energy, which contributes to several health problems. In 2016, 6.7 million Peruvians were living in rural areas. The Fondo de Inclusión Social Energético (FISE) LPG Promotion Program, which began in 2012 and is housed under the Ministry of Energy and Mining, is a government-sponsored initiative aimed at reducing use of solid fuels by increasing access to clean fuel for cooking to poor Peruvian households.MethodsWe conducted a mixed methods study incorporating data from publicly available records and reports, a community survey of 375 households in Puno (the province with the largest number of FISE beneficiary households), and in-depth interviews with community members and key stakeholders. We used the Reach, Effectiveness – Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to guide our data collection and analysis efforts. In a sample of 95 households, we also measured 48-hour area concentrations and personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5).ResultsThe FISE LPG promotion program has achieved high geographical reach; the program is currently serving households in 100% of districts in Peru. Households with access to electricity may be participating at a higher level than households without electricity because the program is implemented primarily by electricity distributors. In a sample of 95 households, FISE beneficiaries experienced a reduction in kitchen concentrations of PM2.5; however, there were no differences in personal exposures, and both kitchen and personal exposures were above the WHO intermediate target for indoor air quality. Among the 375 households surveyed, stove stacking with biomass fuels was reported in >95% of both beneficiary and non-beneficiary households, with fewer than 5% reporting exclusive use. In-depth interviews suggest that the complexity of the enrollment process and access to LPG distribution points may be key barriers to participating in FISE.ConclusionThe FISE LPG Program has achieved high reach and its targeted subsidy and surcharge-based financing structure represent a potentially feasible and sustainable model for other government programs. However, the prevalence of stove stacking among FISE beneficiaries remains high. There is a need for improved communication channels between program implementers and beneficiaries. FISE should also consider expanding the mobile LPG network and community delivery service to reduce physical barriers and indirect costs of LPG acquisition. Finally, increasing the value of LPG vouchers to completely cover one or two tanks a month, or alternatively, introducing behavior change strategies to reduce monthly LPG usage, may facilitate the transition to exclusive LPG use.","Volume 46, Pages 1-122 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/46/suppl/C,3
"BackgroundThe Government of Ghana launched the Rural LPG (RLP) promotion program in 2013 as part of its efforts to reduce fuelwood consumption. The aim of the RLP is to contribute to Ghana's overarching goal to provide LPG access to 50% of Ghana's population by 2020. The RLP has not announced long-term program objectives. However, in the interim the RLP targeted a cumulative total of 170,000 LPG cookstoves to rural households by the end of 2017. As of November 2017, 149,500 rural households had received the LPG cook stoves. Our case study documents Ghana's experiences to date with LPG scale up.MethodsWe carried out a desktop review/document analysis of literature on the RLP. Each document was reviewed for information related to the elements of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework as it pertained to LPG promotion and adoption. In-depth interviews were held among key stakeholders in Ghana. Previously collected data from a field evaluation of the RLP was also assessed.FindingsGenerally, our evaluation suggests that the current form of the RLP is not achieving its stated goal. Our evaluation of the RLP in five rural communities showed that about 58% of households had never refilled their LPG cylinders nine months after the initial delivery of a filled cylinder. Only 8% still used their LPG at 18 months post distribution. Cost and distance to LPG filling stations were the main reasons for low LPG use. Beneficiaries did not exclusively use their LPG even at the initial stages when all of them had LPG in their cylinders. Ghana is currently undergoing transitions in the LPG sector including a change from the current private cylinder ownership model to a cylinder recirculation model for the distribution of LPG. There was no evidence of a well-documented implementation framework for the RLP.ConclusionFuel cost, poor LPG access, and an inadequate implementation framework hinder the RLP implementation.","Volume 46, Pages 1-122 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/46/suppl/C,3
"In 2016, the government of Cameroon, a central African country heavily reliant on wood fuel for cooking, published a Masterplan for increasing primary use of LPG from 20% to 58% of households by 2035. Developed via a multi-sectoral committee with support from the Global LPG Partnership, the plan envisages a 400 million Euro investment program to 2030, focused on increasing LPG cylinder numbers, key infrastructure, and enhanced regulation.

"After more than three decades of access to low-cost liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) financed by large direct government subsidies, >90% of Ecuadorian households cook primarily with LPG. Due to the large fiscal burden of the LPG subsidy, increases in electricity from hydropower, and other socio-political factors, the Government of Ecuador has launched a major induction stove program (PEC) to reduce the demand for LPG. We assess the effects of the LPG subsidies and PEC using government records, interviews, academic literature, newspaper reports, household surveys, and focus groups. Household surveys, conducted in rural, northern Ecuadorian households (n = 383), characterized cooking patterns and fuel access. Focus groups (n = 6) were carried out with a subset of surveyed households to better characterize survey findings. The LPG subsidy was developed as part of broad social support reforms in the early 1970s, without specific aims to reduce the health impacts of household air pollution from woodfuel or provide economic benefits as part of the transition to a clean cooking fuel. Nonetheless, the subsidy has resulted in nearly all Ecuadorian households cooking primarily with LPG. PEC has generated the sale of 740,000 induction stoves since its inception in 2014, short of the goal of 3.5 million. Among the rural households surveyed, LPG use, acceptance, and satisfaction was high, however, more than three-quarters of those surveyed reported weekly woodfuel use. Induction stove ownership (17%) and use as a primary cooking fuel (1%) was low among the rural households surveyed; furthermore, households owning induction stoves reported very low satisfaction with the stoves. Here we show that nationally-representative surveys reporting only “primary cooking fuel” use may underestimate solid fuel use as a supplemental household cooking energy, particularly in rural areas where fuel availability issues play a stronger role in decisions about what fuels to use.","Volume 46, Pages 1-122 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/46/suppl/C,3
"Solar heat could displace fossil fuel to reduce energy cost for brooding livestock and poultry. A transpired solar collector (TSC), consisting of a perforated dark-colored metal surface, can provide considerable heating but metal TSCs (mTSCs) are expensive. Since a perforated black plastic sheet will be less-expensive, a plastic TSC (pTSC) was evaluated. The 1.49 m2 pTSC (porosity of 1.2%) supplemented a propane heater in a room housing 240 turkey poults; an adjacent room without a pTSC, with 240 poults was the control. Monitoring was performed over two flocks of poults. A custom-built controller bypassed the pTSC during nighttime or when the room did not require heating to bring in fresh air. The pTSC gave a maximum temperature rise of 25.4 °C at a solar irradiance (I) of 882 W/m2 and suction velocity (Vs) of 0.033 m/s over 15 min. Over 178 h of operation, with an average I of 668 ± 295 W/m2 and average Vs of 0.036 m/s, the pTSC increased air temperature by an average of 8.1 ± 4.2 °C. Probably due to higher ventilation rate and an oversized propane heater, propane use was not reduced in the Test room with the pTSC vs. the Control room. The Test room had lower CO2 and CO concentrations due to higher ventilation, which may have improved turkey performance. The metal TSC gave a slightly higher temperature rise at a lower Vs but the less-expensive pTSC could be a more cost-effective solar air heater that could readily be scaled up for agricultural and other applications in many parts of the world. Scale-up considerations seem feasible and are presented for a 10,000-poult brooder barn.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"Off-grid, renewable based electricity systems are becoming increasingly competitive for remote rural communities. When the electricity supplied is used productively by micro and small enterprises (MSE), it has the potential to contribute to income generation and poverty reduction. MSE are prevalent in rural Kenya to complement agricultural activities. However, most of them struggle to survive and they provide insufficient income to escape poverty. This paper investigates if the provision of electricity through solar mini-grids could contribute to improving business performance in rural Kenya. We use a difference-in-differences approach to compare business outcomes before and after electrification in regions with and without mini-grids. Outcomes include opening hours, number of enterprises, profits, sales, and expenses. Our results show that nearly two years after the implementation of mini-grids, these have not had the intended effect of improving business performance. Electricity consumption has remained low and demand for the products and services sold by local businesses has not picked up after the arrival of mini-grids. We recommend adjusting the size of the systems to the actual demand and implementing complementary measures to improve agricultural productivity and access to external markets.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"Crossflow turbines are commonly used in low-head small hydro systems, typically less than 50 m, and produce power up to a few hundred kWs. A crossflow turbine is a unique type of hydro-turbine in that the flow passes twice through the runner. Therefore, the power is extracted in two stages. These turbines often employ a guide vane in the nozzle for controlling the flow entering the runner. However, a guide vane significantly reduces the quality of the entry flow by splitting it into two jets and producing non-uniform entry flow angles which can cause a serious loss in turbine efficiency. Adhikari and Wood (2017) and Adhikari and Wood (2018) showed that well designed crossflow turbines without a guide vane can achieve full-load efficiencies of over 90%. This leaves open the issue of maintaining high efficiency at part-load, defined as reduced flow at constant head. As for other hydro-turbine types, efficient part-load operation cannot be achieved solely by employing power electronics to reduce the shaft speed as the flow decreases. This paper analyzes a slider or “Cink” control device at the entry to the runner to reduce the entry arc, i.e. the angular extent of the runner entry, as the flow rate decreases, (Sinagra et al., 2014). We show that a properly operated slider will maintain the radial and azimuthal entry velocities at their full-load values and therefore will not change the optimum shaft speed as the flow rate changes. This simplifies the power electronics required for the turbine generator. Three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations of a 0.53 kW turbine with 88% full-load efficiency showed that the slider maintains high efficiency at part-flow conditions. We conclude that the slider shows significant advantages over a guide vane as the primary means of crossflow turbine control at part-load.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"The building sector is one of the most relevant sectors in terms of generation of wealth and occupation, but it is also one of the main contributor to energy use and greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. at the European level it is currently responsible for 36% of CO2 emissions). For these reason this sector must play a key role in achieving a low-carbon economy consistent with the objective of holding the increase of the average temperature of the globe below 2 °C if compared to pre-industrial levels.In this context, the paper analyses the potential impact of climate change on the energy uses for heating and cooling in southern Europe, based on the assumptions of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) future climate projections (assessment report 5). Different General Circulation Models (GCMs) were analysed using different metrics for selecting the most suitable one to be applied to building simulation. GCM data were used as input to a downscaling method known as “morphing”, to generate hourly weather files for 3 future time projections (2035, 2065 and 2090). Finally, in order to assess the building energy use for heating and cooling for the next century, energy simulations for a case study were performed.The results show, in all scenarios, consistent and large increases in future air temperature. The impacts of these driving forces on heating and cooling energy use are very relevant: the results show an overall increase in total energy consumption with a relative decrease in heating demand and increase in cooling demand: the yearly heating and cooling energy requirement in 2090 is expected to increase in a range of +50.8–119.7% if measures are not foreseen to counter and limit the effects of climate change.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"Solar technology has been identified as a key tool to fight climate change. The sector, promoted by several policy enablers, has seen a rapid growth in terms of deployment, with the global capacity reaching 390 GW at the end of 2017. In recent years, an increasing number of countries are adopting auctions to award solar contracts, resulting in steep tariff reductions. Researchers, while analyzing solar auctions, focused on ground level deployment, without capturing other factors influencing the investors' decisions. India, with its ambitious solar plan, has seen numerous contracts being awarded under auction schemes run by its federal and state agencies. We regressed eleven variables across thirty-two solar tenders issued in India between 2014 and 2017. Analysis of these auctions brought out a different set of determinants for federal and state programmes. On an overall basis, factors like solar targets, utilities' credentials and the level of subscription came out as strong determinants. Additionally, cost of funds and module price figured as drivers in the federal bids. Possible recommendations include spatial and temporal spacing of bids, sale to multiple off-takers and provision of risk guarantee funds. These factors may be taken into consideration by Indian Policy makers while designing solar tenders.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"This paper presents an assessment of post-acquisition service for “improved” cookstoves (e.g., user maintenance training, replacement parts, and repair services) in four regions of Peru. Household surveys assessed current stove use behavior, maintenance practices, stove damage, access to after-sales services, and user preferences towards after-sales intervention strategies (n = 699). Stove use and performance was evaluated in a subsample of households through kitchen performance tests (n = 122) and direct stove use monitoring (n = 58). Participants reported having had their improved cookstove for an average of 5 years. Measured and reported improved stove use was high across all households, including widespread displacement of traditional stoves. Nearly all interviewees recognized that stove performance and stove lifetimes were enhanced through regular stove maintenance. Although more than half of participants reported that no post-acquisition services were offered, two-thirds of those that were offered services utilized them and nearly all found the services either somewhat or very useful. The majority of participants with an improved stove reported damage, primarily to the combustion chamber and chimney. However, results from kitchen performance tests showed no difference in stove performance between stoves with and without damage to the combustion chamber or chimney. Overall, survey results suggest high demand for improved access to post-acquisition services.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"It is investigated a lithium-ion battery thermal management (BTM) system using the electric vehicle (EV) air conditioning refrigerant to cool the battery pack directly. In the system, basic finned-tube heat exchanger structure and a special aluminum frame are adopted to design the battery pack thermal management module with lithium-ion batteries of cylindrical shape. The module is then integrated into the electric vehicle air conditioning system using two electronic expansion valves for the automatic control of the pack's temperature with self-programmed control software. Experimental results show that the BTM system can control the battery pack's temperature in an appropriate preset value easily under extreme ambient temperature, as high as 40 °C. In addition, through the refrigerant circuit optimization it can reduce the temperature non-uniformity inside the battery pack.

"In most countries, energy efficiency at the residential level has been largely delegated to the dynamics of real-estate markets after setting a minimum level. This regulatory definition is in certain cases supplemented by energy performance certificates, such as in the case of the European Union. This approach is based on the understanding that avoided energy-consumption costs positively affect the willingness to pay for them, thus leading to higher prices capable of offsetting production costs and thereby encouraging developers. The case of the private housing market in Santiago de Chile was selected as a reference for a developing country in which energy performance certificates, although they exist as an instrument, are not required to be applied in property transactions. However, unlike most of the research performed in developed countries, it is difficult to analyse price formation using methods based on observed preferences in areas in which there are few energy-certified buildings. Using the technique of contingent valuation, such as the method based on stated preferences, enables one to overcome this difficulty. This article investigates willingness to pay for improvements in the energy efficiency of buyers for new homes based on a representative investment/operation cost analysis. This approach has been addressed to open the debate on the convenience of modifying the national construction code and rethinking the energy certification scheme as well as an exploratory study to undercover further research lines to support the aforementioned discussion. The results suggests that there is a number of potential home buyers ready to pay for energy efficiency when they are informed on the cost savings associated to structural modifications and the cost of providing such improvements and such willingness to pay is not monolithic across the respondents, but seems to be influenced by the education level plausibly associated to the purchase power.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4

"Due to the Venturi effect caused by a diffuser, which speed-up the velocity through the rotor, shrouded turbines are able to exceed the Betz-Joukowsky limit if the power coefficient is based on the rotor diameter. However, on hydrokinetic turbines this increased velocity may also promote cavitation on the blade. As this subject is still not clear on the current literature, this work presents a novel approach for optimizing hydrokinetic turbines free of cavitation under diffuser effect. The model uses the minimum pressure coefficient as the criterion to keep the pressure near blade tip above water vapor pressure. It includes an extension of Vaz & Wood's optimization in order to take into account the influence of the diffuser speed-up ratio regarding cavitation effect. A changing on the thrust coefficient is assumed to optimize chord and twist angle distributions along the blade. As a result, the proposed model shows that cavitation is indeed sensitive to the diffuser speed-up ratio, demonstrating that such a phenomenon needs to be considered in the design of diffuser-augmented hydrokinetic turbines. Also, the optimization method corrects the chord without relevant changing in the turbine power coefficient, where the increased power output is about 42% higher than the bare turbine for a water velocity of 2.5 m/s. In this case, the model is assessed through comparisons using a 3-bladed hydrokinetic turbine with 10 m diameter, in which the diffuser speed-up ratio is varied. Furthermore, an evaluation is made with models available in the literature, suggesting good performance concerning the cavitation analysis on shrouded rotor design with the proposed optimization procedure.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"In developing countries, woodfuels (fuelwood and charcoal) can contribute 50–90 percent of all household energy and contribute up to 8 percent of total household income. This demand for woodfuels is largely driven by 40% of the world’s population dependant on solid fuels (primarily fuelwood) to meet their daily household cooking energy requirements. Absent major policy changes and sustained effort, the total number of households dependent on woodfuels is not expected to decline significantly by 2030. Efficient and sustainable management of forest resources for energy is thus essential in order to alleviate the negative environmental and social impacts that might arise from woodfuel extraction. However, long term management requires a deeper understanding of the local resource and the particular fuel collection habits of local populations. Yet, research on fuelwood collection patterns is limited, both in scale and depth. Previous studies on fuelwood collection locations have relied on self-reported data or large-scale analyses. Research on actual measured distance, location, or time required for collection is limited, particularly spatially explicit measures of collection. We add to this literature and fill the gap by applying home range analysis, typically used for movement of wildlife, to human fuelwood collection patterns in India. We track households using GPS loggers in five villages across three districts in India to cover a range of topography, forest resources, fuelwood demand and socio-demographics. We use the minimum convex polygon to map Resource Collection Polygons (RCP) at each of the five villages. We find that fuelwood collection is not evenly spread out among villages with distances for collection varying by the quality of forest resources available, nature of farm crops that can substitute for wood from forests, and also by certain socio-economic characteristics. Our research could be a base to build upon for further, more detailed analysis, and applied to understand other human behaviors such as food and water collection.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"In recent years, the popularity of single family homes, which have higher energy intensity than multi-family homes, has increased steadily in Turkey. This trend can be contributed to the interest of middle and high-income families towards living in larger homes, which also offer more privacy. Since multi-family homes are prevalent in Turkey, various studies are conducted to investigate the application of energy efficiency measures to these type of homes. Due to the increase in the number of single family homes and lack of research conducted to reduce the energy consumption for these type of dwellings, determining the feasibility of energy efficiency measures for the Turkish single family housing stock is an important concern. In this study, the techno-economic feasibility of applying a wide range of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy technologies to existing single family homes is investigated using monitored energy consumption data and building energy simulation program. The findings are extrapolated to the existing single family housing stock in three major cities of Turkey, namely Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir, to estimate the potential for energy and emission reductions in Turkey. The results indicate that applying window glazing, roof, and a combination of window, wall, and roof improvements reduce heating energy demand by 21%, 34%, and 50%, respectively, with favorable payback periods. Among the renewable energy technologies analyzed, solar domestic hot water system results in the highest energy savings with the shortest payback period. Applying the combination of wall, window, and roof improvements and the retrofit of solar domestic water heating systems to existing single family homes in Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir result in reductions of about 14 million, 8 million, and 15 million m3/year natural gas consumption in Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir, respectively. These results can be used to develop policies for building insulation and equipment standards towards achieving low energy and emission national housing stock.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"Spent coffee grounds mixed with wheat straw or miscanthus straws were used as substrates for oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) production. The biomethane potential of spent mushroom composts was determined, and the influence of fungal digestion (FD) on the overall conversion balance of the substrates to valuable products, i.e. edible mushroom carpophores and biomethane (CH4) was investigated. Only 3–7% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the initial substrates was recovered as harvested carpophores, while about 50% was recovered as CH4 by anaerobic digestion (AD) of the fungal compost. Anaerobic digestibility of the fungal compost after FD was very close to the anaerobic digestibility of the initial substrates, but the amount of matter was reduced by 17–22% as dry matter, 20% as volatile solids and 12–27% as COD, most probably by fungal respiration. As a consequence, the CH4 production per amount of initial substrate was lower. However, owing to the much higher economic value of edible carpophores as compared to CH4, a rough assessment of the economic balance was largely in favour of FD prior to AD. As compared to wheat straw, miscanthus straw presented both a lower final conversion to biomethane and a lower amount of harvested carpophores. Valorization through FD before AD is to be preferred as compared to direct biomethanation of the initial substrates.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"Supplying electricity to populations without full access requires cost-effective, distributed sources of electricity generation. Diesel generators are a popular electricity source because of their low capital costs, but they can have high operating costs. Little data exist regarding the real-world behavior and operating costs of installed diesel microgrids. We report on the energy delivery and fuel consumption in three diesel microgrids in the Lake Sentani region of Papua, Indonesia. We found that these generators are operated below their capacity and that the fuel used per unit of electricity delivered can be over five times greater than expected based on published values. These estimations of specific fuel consumption suggest that nominally electrified areas are paying high costs for poor reliability, but cost-effective improvements are possible.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"This study was conducted to assess the determinants of households' decision for adoption of improved cook stoves (ICS), the performance of the stoves under real kitchen conditions and their potential in the reduction of greenhouse gas emission in Bale Eco-region, Southeastern Ethiopia. Data for this study were collected from 342 household heads that were randomly selected from four rural kebeles. For Kitchen Performance Test (KPT), 25 ICS and 30 traditional cook stove (TCS) user households were selected using stratified random sampling. The data gathered through questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. The data gathered from KPT were analyzed using independent t-test. Accordingly, the regression result revealed that higher education level of household head, larger family size and presence of separate kitchen house were significantly and positively related to the adoption of ICS. On the other hand, having men-headed household was related negatively to the decision of households adopting ICS in a significant manner. The KPT result showed that an average of 1.12 (SD = 0.3) kg of firewood is consumed per day for each Standard Adult Equivalent (SAE) for TCS users while an average of 0.79 (SD = 0.2) kg of firewood is consumed per day for each SAE for ICS. The KPT result also showed that using an ICS results in an annual emission reduction of 0.494 tons of CO2 equivalent.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"This study assessed personal exposure to PM2.5 and the associated potential health outcomes in Accra, Ghana. The Household Air Pollution Tool model was employed to estimate health benefits attributable to various fuel use scenarios using user-derived and publicly available inputs, including the Global Burden of Disease data presented by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. This study assessed personal exposure for four fuel user groups: LPG-only, LPG and charcoal, charcoal only, and wood use alone or in combination with any other fuel. Ambient PM2.5 concentrations were also assessed during the study period. The wood user group demonstrated significantly higher PM2.5 exposure than the other three user groups, which all had average PM2.5 personal exposure similar to the average ambient PM2.5 concentration. The results of the exposure assessment imply that ambient particulate matter may drive the majority of PM2.5 exposure in peri-urban LPG and charcoal using households in Accra and therefore for the majority of homes in Accra (~80% are non-wood users in urban Ghana), reductions in PM2.5 exposure and associated health gains may require reducing ambient PM. From a study by Zhou et al., in Accra biomass burning accounted for 39–62% of total PM2.5 mass in the kitchen in different neighborhoods. Road dust and vehicle emissions comprised 12–33% of PM2.5 mass. This means that even if direct PM emissions are low from LPG and charcoal burning homes, homes using wood fuel to meet their household energy needs contribute to ambient PM, which influences the PM2.5 exposure of their non-wood using neighbors.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"Isolated developing communities in mountain ranges can generate electricity with the help of micro-hydropower schemes. The arrival of electricity to communities can bring numerous socio-economic benefits as well as improved livelihood, but there is a lack of international studies on livelihood improvements brought by the implementation of micro-hydropower schemes. This study aims to identify the most significant livelihood improvements associated with the implementation of micro-hydropower schemes and highlighted the capacities communities have to make an effective use of such improvements. The analysis is based on the evaluation of 17 communities from Bolivia and the Philippines. Visits to communities, engagement with local developers and community interviews were used to evaluate 22 livelihood indicators from five broad categories: health, education, safety, community engagement and economy. The capability approach was used as a framework to identify the most common livelihood improvements. Results show significant improvements in all aspects, especially in education, community engagement and economy. Improved lighting is identified as the most influential factor across the five aspects, but developing organizations implementation techniques and electricity usage differ between countries. Women appear to benefit more from drudgery reduction and men from community engagement opportunities. In conclusion, livelihood improvements were clearly observed and these might have a positive impact in the future sustainability of schemes.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"This paper presents a control approach for the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) based Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS) under a wide range of wind speeds. Generally, most of the wind turbines are turned-off and disconnected from the power grid, in case wind velocity is gone over 25 m/s. It may cause wind power supply shortage from wind farms. This research introduces a pitch angle controller as well as a rotational speed control system so that the PMSG based WECS can generate power if the wind speeds are above 25 m/s. The proposed method reduces the mechanical stress of the wind turbine by preferential reducing of the rotational speed rather than the mechanical torque during strong wind condition. As a result, the chance of turning-off the is reduced compared to the conventional control system because the PMSG based WECS can temporarily tolerate the wind speed up to 35 m/s. A 2 MW WECS with the electrical and mechanical characteristics is modeled in the MATLAB/SimPowerSystems® to verify the proposed research.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"In Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) projects, Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) often provide guarantees on the energy savings of proposed retrofit measures based on a simplified engineering method. In order to assess the risk of saving shortfalls, there is a need to develop an evaluation method based on the probabilistic approach. This study focuses on a proposed probabilistic approach to evaluate the performance risks of common lighting retrofit measures such as replacement of existing lighting, installation of daylight-linked lighting controls and occupancy-based controls. The proposed approach considers the variations in the influential factors affecting energy performance, including daylight availability, occupancy rates, lamp conditions and lighting use patterns. Empirical data is used to develop the probability distribution functions of those influential factors. A hypothetical 40-storey office building with typical design features (such as regularly shaped open plan) in Hong Kong was modeled using EnergyPlus to demonstrate the application of this probabilistic approach. The results indicate that the variations in actual energy savings can be substantial in lighting retrofit projects, ranging from 1,267,000 kWh (43% of pre-retrofit consumption) to 1,927,000 kWh (65% ditto) with 90% statistical significance, posing risk on the achievement of guarantee savings in an EPC project setting.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"Water wheels were the earliest hydraulic machines used in antiquity to convert water energy into mechanical one. Due to their simple installation, low maintenance costs, and thanks to the possibility to use local manpower and material for their construction, nowadays water wheels are again used as energy supply, especially in remote localities and emerging countries. In particular, stream water wheels are installed in flowing water where there are not head differences. The performance depends on the blockage ratio, so that they can be subdivided into three main categories: stream wheels in shallow subcritical flow, shallow supercritical flow and deep flow.In this paper, experimental, theoretical and numerical data on stream water wheels were systematically collected from literature and analyzed. Guidelines for their design were discussed focusing especially on wheel dimensions, supporting structures, blades and speed. More light on their hydraulic behavior was shed, adopting the previous classification for a better explanation and understanding. Results showed that in shallow water an head difference can be generated by the wheel, increasing the power output. In deep flow, accurate hydrodynamic floating/supporting structures allow the hydrostatic force of water to be exploited in addition to the kinetic energy of the flow. As a consequence, power output can improve from 0.5 to more than 10 kW per meter width, so that stream wheels can represent an attractive energy supply in zero head sites.",Volume 45,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/45/suppl/C,4
"Green bonds and fossil divestment has emerged as a bottom-up approach to climate action within the business community. Recent pledges by large banks and institutional investors have reached levels that have the potential to contribute markedly to a low carbon transition. We find that in a green finance scenario reflecting a reasonable upscaling of current level of pledges towards 2030, green finance leads to somewhat higher GDP while shifting income from capital owners to wage earners. Although effects differ among regions the green finance reduces global coal consumption to 2.5% below BAU in 2030, raising the share of non-fossil electricity from 42 to 46% at the global level. Over the period towards 2030, green finance avoids global CO2 emissions corresponding to total emissions of the European Union and Japan in a recent year.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"Rural electrification has progressed unevenly across the world since 1945, with some rural communities gaining access to power decades earlier than others. We examine the association between early electrification and the quality of electricity service to households, testing the hypothesis that aging infrastructure compromises the quality of electricity service. Using the 2014–2015 ACCESS survey from rural India, we find that early electrification is associated with improvements in the quality of electricity service, even controlling for village size and distance to nearest town. A possible explanation for the finding is that early electrification generates economic gains that allow the rural community to invest in maintenance and upgrades.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"This paper presents a study on the application of lightweight steel framed (LSF) construction systems in hot climate. A generative design method created 6010 houses, with random geometry and random roof and exterior wall types with different insulation levels, and EnergyPlus was used to evaluate the energy consumption for air-conditioning of each building. The main goals were to determine which geometric variables correlate with the energy performance, and to provide some guidelines to foster efficient LSF buildings in hot climates. By correlating six geometry-based indexes with the energy consumption for each construction element type group, it was verified that roofs do not show significant correlation, while exterior walls presented weak to moderate positive correlation with the building volume, very weak to weak negative correlation with the relative compactness, no correlation with the shape coefficient, moderate to strong negative correlation with the window-to-floor, window-to-wall, and window-to-exterior surface ratios. The results also show that buildings with larger windows and greater level of insulation have better energy performance. No significant difference of energy performance was found between different LSF construction systems with equivalent thermal resistance.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"Anaerobic digestion is a well-known and potentially beneficial process for rural communities in emerging markets, providing the opportunity to generate usable gaseous fuel from waste resources. With recent developments in low-cost digestion technology, communities across the world are gaining affordable access to the benefits of anaerobic digestion derived biogas. For example, biogas provides a more efficient and cleaner burning alternative to biomass (wood, charcoal, dung), effectively reducing harmful emissions and fuel consumption.This study sought to develop and test a design approach for optimizing flame port geometry for household biogas-fired burners. The approach consists of a multi-component simulation that incorporates three-dimensional CAD designs with simulated chemical kinetics and computational fluid dynamics. The simulated flame port designs included an array of circular and rectangular geometries using a widely available biogas burner. The three highest performing designs identified were manufactured and tested experimentally to validate model outputs and to compare against a baseline port geometry. In the experiment, each of the three designs suggested improved thermal efficiency relative to the baseline. A configuration of four millimeter circular ports resulted in a 7.17% improvement, raising an average thermal efficiency of 53.0% to 56.8%. The results indicated that hydraulic diameter, velocity and mixture density are relevant factors in port geometry design to improve the thermal efficiency of a biogas burner. Conversely, the emissions predictions made by the model were found to be unreliable and incongruent with laboratory experiments.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"We examined the role of supply and demand side factors in the choice of household cooking fuel using a multilevel modeling approach that included the effects of spatial autocorrelation. The use of wood was found to be significantly associated with all forest types - whether they were natural or plantations; whether they were owned by households or other entities. Land under perennial crops was also positively associated with wood use. In peri-urban communes wood usage decreased over the years. In rural communes wood use however increased. This may partly be due to the natural transition from crop residues to wood. We find some evidence that given Viet Nam's successful small-holder plantation programs there may be places where movement up the energy ladder from wood to cleaner fuels has slowed down. In the future household factors are likely to continue being the dominant drivers of fuel switching. However, our study indicates that external interventions aimed at improving community conditions such as access to markets and highways can also facilitate households moving up the energy ladder. Our findings are of much relevance to the newly proposed policy paradigm of “making the clean available” as opposed to “making the available clean”.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"Micro-hydropower (MHP) schemes can be a good option to meet the energy demands of remote communities in developing countries, particularly in mountainous areas with good water supplies. Physical (i.e. head and flow) and economic requirements are essential for MHP scheme feasibility, but social, environmental and political factors can also be critical for the performance and longevity of the scheme after its installation. MHP scheme feasibility evaluation, thus, requires a holistic approach, where the socio-economic characteristics of the community, electricity policies and other geophysical parameters of the environment have to be considered. This study identified the most important criteria for evaluating the success of MHP schemes from the communities' point of view based on site visits and interviews with developers, operators and key community members of 35 schemes spanning Nepal, Bolivia, Cambodia and the Philippines. Proper regular operation, ongoing support by the community, and long term support from the government or local developer were key factors for MHP scheme success. The most recurrent failure reasons were maintenance difficulties, extreme weather events, and the arrival of the national grid. A framework to evaluate the current level of success of existing schemes was developed and applied for cross country comparison.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"Recent advances in smart grid technology enable new approaches to address the problem of load control for domestic water heating. Since water heaters store energy, they are well-suited to load management. However, existing approaches have focused on the electrical supply side, ignoring the obvious link between the user and the grid: individual hot water consumption patterns. This paper proposes a load spreading approach in which water heaters compete for access to the heating medium. The proposed smart grid solution takes grid load limits, real-time temperature measurements, water usage patterns, individual user comfort, and heater meta-data into consideration. The scheduler only turns on the heaters with the highest level of need, but limits the number of on heaters to ensure that the grid load stays below a set limit for a set time. The method is evaluated by simulation against various heater set temperature levels, and for various load limits, and compared with ripple control and actual consumption measured in a field trial of 34 water heaters. The proposed algorithm reduces the load from 62 kW to 20, 30, 40, and 50 kW (vs. 106 kW for full ripple control). The resulting number of unwanted cold events is fewer than for ripple control, and only slightly more than no control, while reducing the total energy by 14% from a user-optimised natural experiment.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"We assess whether carbon pricing in combination with targeted use of the associated revenues could jointly advance Peru's long-term climate change mitigation targets and short-term socio-economic development goals. Based on expert interviews and detailed document analysis, we draw parallels to extractive industries, where revenues that are earmarked for public investment have often been found to be used ineffectively. Based on these experiences, we identify five key areas that could help to establish carbon pricing as a cross-cutting issue in the context of sustainable development: First, emphasizing the co-benefits of carbon pricing. Second, reforming the power sector to increase the use of low-cost renewable sources. Third, assessing the equity aspects of such policies and designing appropriate compensation systems.

"Ethanol has been proposed as a clean cooking fuel to reduce the use of charcoal in urban and peri-urban households in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This could have the twin benefits of reduced impacts on human health and deforestation. The aim of this study is to better understand the barriers to the uptake of ethanol stove technologies by eliciting users' perception, adoption, and use patterns of ethanol stoves. The study was undertaken in Maputo, a city that was the focus of the first large-scale commercial ethanol stove project in Africa. A mixed-methods approach was adopted using both quantitative (N = 341 household interviews) and qualitative methods (5 focus group discussions, expert interviews). Ethanol stoves are currently used by about 17% of the surveyed households, while approximately 12% had discontinued its use and 71% never used it. While a large proportion of ethanol users compared the stove favourably against charcoal in terms of cooking time, convenience, cleanliness, and easiness to use, ethanol use seems to have diminished compared to charcoal. Ethanol seems to have replaced other clean cooking technologies such as electricity or LPG rather than charcoal. High ethanol fuel prices combined with low fuel quality and accessibility, as well as stove malfunctions due to poor design influenced many ethanol stove adopters to quit it. For the effective uptake of ethanol, it will be necessary to address the factors that tend to discourage its use, particularly its high initial and operational cost, poor fuel quality, unreliable fuel supply, and poor stove design. Although clean cooking fuels might not be attractive to users due to affordability and failure to meet user preferences, awareness raising campaigns that target potential users should emphasise the associated health and safety benefits of clean cooking fuels.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"Nowadays, a major preoccupation is the production and usage of fuels obtained from renewable and eco-friendly sources. Camelina sativa is well-suited to be a sustainable bio-fuel crop, as its seeds naturally have high oil content. However, the process of obtaining bio-kerosene from camelina oil by hydrotreatment is time consuming and expensive at this moment. Thus, the possibility of using straight camelina oil as fuel in terrestrial applications has been taken into consideration. For this purpose, combustion tests have been conducted on a burner. Tests at different burner functioning regimes have been carried out by varying both the pressure of the air used for fuel atomization, and the air flow delivered by the burner's fan. The influence of the variation of the fuel preheating temperature is also studied and presented. During the tests, the composition of the exhaust gas and temperature have been monitored and registered using two gas analysers. The results have been compared with those obtained when the burner was fuelled with pure kerosene.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"Anaerobic digestion of animal waste is a well-established technology for on-farm waste management and energy generation. Animal wastes often contain toxic substances such as antibiotic, which have been shown to cause varying degrees of biogas inhibition in single stage (SS) digestion system. Currently, useful information on influence of antibiotic contamination of substrates, particularly cefazolin (CFZ), on two-stage (TS) digestion system is limited. The effect of CFZ antibiotic on performance of two-stage and single batch systems digesting mixture of manure and milk from dairy cow was investigated. Batch experiments were conducted at 55 °C in TS (5 and 15 days for first and second stages, respectively) and SS (20 days) digesters. Cefazolin was added at concentration of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/l. Control experiments, with no addition of CFZ were also conducted. In TS system, all concentrations of CFZ exhibited complete or near complete inhibition of hydrogen production in the first stage, with methane reductions of 9.2–56.0% in the second stage as compared with control treatment. Corresponding biogas inhibitions for the system ranged from 7.3–29.1%. The inhibition resulted in reduction of energy recovery by 16.7–60.6%. For SS system, CFZ addition reduced 39.8–68.3% of methane production while total biogas inhibition ranged 24.0–39.0%. The inhibition also resulted in reduction of energy recovery by 39.7–68.3%. Evidently, lower biogas inhibitions and reduction in energy recovery were experienced in TS system as compared with SS system. The results thus suggest that TS system can be an alternative to conventional SS system for on-farm management of CFZ contaminated wastes.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"The recent Zambian energy crisis began in June 2015 when ZESCO, a parastatal electric utility, implemented country-wide load-shedding (an intentional disruption of power) nominally lasting 8 h per day. The cause of the energy crisis is a confluence of several factors: infrastructure under-investment, over-reliance on and mismanagement of hydro-power generation resources, rapidly growing demand, and reduced reservoir inflow from lower than average rainfall. This research investigates how Zambian households adapted their energy consumption to cope with load-shedding. The research is based on the responses from 261 oral surveys conducted in four provinces. The results show that fuel-switching, load-shifting and conservation strategies were widely employed, but generally differed across socio-economic dimensions. These strategies in turn affected the net economic expenditure on energy and total energy consumed by each household. An estimation of the economic impact showed an increase in fuel-related expenditure and energy consumption of nearly 50%, largely attributed to fuel-switching to charcoal and generator sets.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"International engagement in sub-Saharan Africa's power sector is increasing rapidly. Aid is used to directly finance a growing number of foreign companies to implement power projects, accompanied by calls for policy and governance reform. This paper argues that while new and much-needed finance is becoming available, the current approach to foreign support poses several new challenges for broad and sustainable long-term development of the African power sector. They include a focus on creating market opportunities for non-African rather than domestic companies, the difficulty of delivering large-scale rural electrification through the externally advocated market-based approach, economic inefficiencies of current aid spending, and the difficulty of tackling complex, country-specific issues with continental electrification initiatives. To address these challenges, we suggest redirecting public funds towards rural electrification, increasing African ownership, individualising policy interventions and easing the current types of neoliberal conditionalities.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"Electrification rates have risen dramatically in many developing countries, but most low-income African countries lag far behind. A growing number of donors are now targeting this issue, notably the United States–sponsored Power Africa initiative. In this paper we summarize research that can inform donors and governments working in this area. We cover challenges to and benefits of expanding grid electricity, prioritizing rigorous impact research in Africa when possible. The evidence we review suggests that potential benefits are large and spread across a variety of economic and noneconomic domains. However, expanding access cost-effectively and sustainably may pose a serious challenge. In particular, relative to the benefits, grid electrification involves substantial costs from building lines, improving capacity, and connecting households—costs that may be higher in Africa than in more densely populated regions of the world. Reducing customer connection costs would increase connection rates and could thus reduce the cost of building new lines per connection but might still not be cost-effective, especially in low-density rural areas.",Volume 44,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/44/suppl/C,5
"Pelletization of garden waste, without additional binder, was investigated to produce high quality fuel pellets for energy utilization. The influence of pelletization parameters viz. feedstock moisture content (5, 15, 25, and 35%), milling size (25.4 and 6.25 mm) and die size (12 and 15 mm) on pellet quality and pelletization process was studied. The results showed that the studied parameters had significant effect on pellet quality. A reduction in average durability value (95.0% to 92.5%) was observed when moisture content of garden waste increased from 5% to 15%. Appropriate regression models were also developed for each quality attribute by using multiple linear regressions. Eventually, a feedstock moisture content of 5 ± 1%, milling size of 6.35 mm and die size of 15 mm were found to offer standard quality pellets with optimum throughput capacity. Scanning electron microscopy image analysis showed a closer agglomeration of biomass particles when feed materials were pelletized at low moisture content. The equilibrium moisture content due to adsorption for garden waste pellet was found to be 14.6% which was quite low as compared to other feedstocks. Furthermore, we deduced from the combustion test that garden waste pellets may be conveniently used in a residential cookstove.

"Clouds are the major modulator of the shortwave and longwave radiation components of the Earth's energy balance and, as such, help to regulate the planet's temperature. In the energy sector, clouds are a source of instability in the generation of energy using solar technologies. This study aims at comparing three approaches to get cloud cover information in the Southeastern region of Brazil during the period of approximately three months. The first method, assumed as reference, uses all-sky camera pictures for the cloud cover estimation. The other two methodologies use downward longwave radiation with surface meteorological data and geostationary satellite data. Both methods presented good agreement with the camera for clear sky and overcast conditions, with probabilities of detection of 92.8% and 80.7% for the longwave method and 93.3% and 87.6% for the satellite method, respectively. The major problem occurs with the broken-clouds sky scenario, with probabilities of detection above 38%, where each method has its own specificity, such as, longwave emissivity of the atmosphere, spatial resolution and view geometry. The long-wave method has the minor R correlation with the camera (87%) when compared with the satellite method (93%) and requires a daily normalization, which make it not usable for instantaneous measurements. Regarding the satellite method, the most important issue is the spatial resolution, which has the major impact on the broken-clouds sky scenarios. The cloud masking works properly for large clouds with, at least, the size comparable to the satellite image pixel. Furthermore, the method using the all-sky camera also needs to be improved, because it presented some deficiencies, like very bright areas around the sun, sometimes identified as clouds, leading to cloud cover overestimation.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"Large scale wind turbines deployed in “behind the meter” applications at medium and large scale industrial consumer sites can offset the purchase of retail electricity from the utility. However, unlike traditional onshore wind farm sites in elevated rural areas, such industrial sites tend to be at lower elevations and located in more urbanised areas with a higher likelihood of being in vicinity of manmade obstacles such as buildings. This research case study presents observed impacts of various site obstacle features, from local buildings to regional topography on the energy performance of an 850 kW rated wind turbine operating in a peri-urban area. The study is based on the analysis of 10-minute SCADA data measured over multiple years. The analysis includes a novel wind turbine electrical energy rose (EER) approach to determine the directional variation of the wind turbine electrical energy output in relation to site features around the turbine location. The paper concludes that low broad buildings with heights of only 20% of the turbine hub height can have a significant energy reducing impact compared to taller narrow buildings and that hills ~ 8 km from the turbine site have an energy reducing impact. The outcomes of the study should be of benefit to those involved in the pre-feasibility stages of deploying single large scale wind turbines at industrial sites in peri-urban areas.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"This study aims at performing the first comprehensive Well-to-Tank (WtT) energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission analysis of 10 different petroleum and natural gas fuels pathways, i.e., gasoline, diesel, CNG and LNG, in Pakistan. The GREET model, developed by the U.S. Argonne National Laboratory, was adopted as a tool for WtT calculation, and most of the data were replaced by Pakistani operating environment. Additional analysis was also performed for the refining process which was the most energy-intensive in the fuel life cycle. A process-level allocation method was used in calculating the refining energy use of individual petroleum products, which could reflect the detailed refining processes. The results indicate that petroleum fuel have WtT efficiencies in the range of 82–86% while WtT efficiencies of natural gas based fuels are in the range of 75–88%. The results reveals that WtT GHG emission associated with CNG produced from indigenous natural gas sources are 16% and 21% higher than the gasoline and diesel fuel produced from ingenious crude oil, respectively. As compared to other countries, the WtT GHG emissions results of Pakistani petroleum and natural gas based fuels are 10% and 29 higher than those of the Europe mainly due to higher methane emission.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"The paper presents a simulation and experimental study on using bi-fuel gasoline - liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for currently used fuel-injected motorcycles in Vietnam. Consequently, an innovative fuel supply system was designed to make the original gasoline motorcycles can flexibly operate on either gasoline or LPG. In this research, simulation processes were conducted by using a dedicated software analysis tool to optimize the operation process of the fuel system in order to maintain its stability and efficiency based on the characteristics of each type of fuels. Meanwhile, the original fuel supply system of the test motorcycle will be modified in the experiment by developing the second Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to control LPG quantity supplied for the one. The results showed that the test motorcycle well operated on either gasoline or LPG on the new design. In addition, when running on LPG the specific fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of the test motorcycle were reduced significantly.

"This short communication piece questions whether unaffordability really matters for families to reject improved fuels. It presents the case of an Indian village where nearly every house has successfully introduced a TV, but only one house adopted LPG for cooking. Considering that the former is more expensive than the latter and whilst both are relatively new and energy-related technologies, the paper asks how and why people decided to adopt one extensively but not the other. Methodologically, the study employs a mixed method approach, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings suggest that the lack of sufficient income has little influence on people to adopt or reject improved fuels. The paper argues that it may not give us a clear picture if we research why people choose or reject one fuel over another. This paper demonstrates that to understand a household's fuel choice decision, it is essential to understand the broader decision-making context within which families operate and make all decisions.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"Uganda occupies a unique space in the history of power sector reform and private electricity investment in Africa. In this article, we describe the drivers for reform as well as the reform process, including the main institutions involved and the legislative and policy instruments that helped shape them. We then offer a brief history of independent power projects (IPPs) in Uganda and emerging Chinese-funded projects, exploring the nexus between the two. Like any other private investment, IPPs require a suitably enabling environment offering long-term investment certainty. Our primary objective is to assess the experience of Uganda's IPPs and consider what might help accelerate private investment in the country's electricity sector. Finally, we attempt to extract the policy lessons that may be learned from this fascinating story.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"Isolated power systems present high levels of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) curtailment as intermittency and isolation impose challenging difficulties regarding the integration of this energy into the electrical grid. The recent developments in electrical vehicles have decreased the kWh cost of lithium-ion batteries below a threshold value that was previously prohibitive for grid-scale applications. Therefore, the integration of RES considering the installation of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) into an isolated power grid is an up-to-date research topic and is assessed in this paper. The BESS is inserted into the Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch (UC + ED) platform and regarded as another dispatchable generator. To keeps the costs down, the BESS is mainly used to provide a portion of the spinning reserve needs and secondly to alleviate the load of the thermal generators, using the free modules. The BESS configurations that maximises the economic viability and minimises the RES curtailment are presented. The results suggest that the investment in this technology may be profitable and considerably decreases the levels of RES curtailment.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"The regional integration of electricity markets has been established as desirable among the South American nations to meet demands through the possible consolidation of a unified competing market in the medium term (CAN, 2010). However, what remains to be defined are rules of the game with satisfactory benefits for all parties that have been demonstrated. In this paper we propose a model of power integration based on the Market Coupling scheme, which starts with the modeling of the national markets using the System Dynamics modeling methodology. As a result, the expected behavior of the system is obtained, except in the case of exports, in which, because of the assumption of an infinite transmission capacity between nations, it is seen to surpass the real values found in the market. The work presented in this document (based on two nations, Colombia and Ecuador) allows experimentation for the formulation of the rules of the game necessary in the regional integration of markets.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"The Government of Nepal has been providing subsidies to promote biogas technology since the 1970s and Solar Home Systems (SHS) since the 1990s. This study uses nationally representative survey data to examine the extent to which these subsidies benefitted the rural poor. We find that only 5% of households who are eligible for a biogas subsidy have adopted biogas; and only 2% of biogas adopters are below the poverty line, as compared to a poverty rate of 19% in the country. For SHS, 27% of the households eligible for subsidy have adopted the technology, and 25% of the adopters are below the poverty line. The SHS subsidy program is much more accessible to the poor as compared to the biogas subsidy program for two main reasons. First, Solar Home Systems are much cheaper than biogas plants, and so are more accessible to the poor after the subsidy, and second, the SHS subsidy is geographically targeted toward poor areas, while the biogas subsidy is not.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"Biogas technology, as a pro-poor renewable energy source, has been promoted in Uganda through the use of fixed dome and floating drum digester designs. However, these designs have proved to be too expensive for the average Ugandan household to afford. A cheaper flexible balloon digester has been proposed to increase uptake. However, there has been lack of evidence on household's willingness to pay (WTP) for the flexible balloon digester and the factors affecting adoption of this alternative design. Primary data were obtained from survey of experimental households and 144 ‘non-biogas’ households in central Uganda. A logistic regression model was used to estimate household's WTP and determine the factors that influence WTP. Results reveal that the majority of surveyed households showed their WTP, but an average household's maximum WTP (US$52) was ten times less than the actual cost of an imported flexible ballon digester unit (US$512). The results further indicate that household size, education level, gender and age of the household head, number of livestock owned, total land area owned and a household's perception on technology significantly influenced the WTP. Thus, government and NGOs interested in promoting this design should pay due attention on ensuring the availability of affordable flexible balloon digester from local sources. Otherwise, the focus should be on promoting either different biogas designs or alternative affordable renewable energy technologies rather than the flexible balloon digester.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"The rapid growth of electricity demand due to the increase in population has put the burden on the power stations of India to enhance their generation. With the serious drop in prices of solar photovoltaic (SPV) generated electricity and rising tariffs on conventional electricity have drawn attention to generate electricity through the solar photovoltaic plant. Therefore, it is important to assess accurately and precisely the annual and monthly yield of SPV plant to help in designing and installation of new plants. Performance analysis of a 5 kWp roof-top photovoltaic plant has carried out, and the effect of temperature analyzed. The annual average daily reference yield, array yield, and final yield found 5.23 kWh/kWp/day, 4.51 kWh/kWp/day and 3.99 kWh/kWp/day respectively. The annual average daily array efficiency, inverter efficiency and system efficiency found to be 11.34%, 88.38%, and 10.02% respectively. The annual average daily performance ratio and capacity utilization factor measured 76.97% and 16.39%. The annual energy yield of the plant recorded 7175.4 kWh. Results show that energy loss is maximum during May when the temperature is highest.

"With just 12 years to go to 2030, progress in providing universal energy access and improving rural development outcomes in many rural areas has been too slow if the Sustainable Development Goals are to be met. Over a three-year period, the Smart Villages Initiative gathered evidence and views from over 1000 stakeholders from 70 countries to identify the framework conditions necessary for the provision of energy services to rural communities and to ensure that energy access translates into improved rural development outcomes. This short communication provides an overview of the key findings of this process and suggests a number of “bottom-up” insights and recommendations.

"An electrical power generator for use with biomass cooking stoves has been developed. The design is intended for users in developing countries who lack regular access to electricity. Electricity is generated based on the thermoelectric effect. A bespoke heat collector captures heat from the combustion chamber of the cooking stove and transfers it to a single thermoelectric generator (TEG) module. To maintain a sufficiently high temperature difference across the TEG, heat is dissipated using a passive single phase liquid thermosiphon system. This cooling system eliminates the requirement for mechanical components such as fans or pumps, which are unreliable and draw significant electrical power. In a controlled laboratory setting, a maximum power of 5.8 W has been produced from a single TEG installed into a low cost ceramic cooking stove currently disseminated in large numbers in Malawi, Africa. The TEG power is controlled using a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) conditioning circuit with an estimated efficiency of ~70%. The circuit provides a stable 5 V output via a USB connector for charging mobile phones, lights, power banks and other devices. Experiments have shown that the device is capable of performing for extended periods without significant reduction in performance. The magnitude of the power generated by this passive cooling system is observed to be comparable to that delivered by similar TEG-stove systems driven by active cooling. An average power generation of over 4 W was achieved which, including circuit efficiency, provided ~10 W·h of useful electrical energy over a 4 h burning interval, which is sufficient for charging low powered electrical appliances. Five prototypes fitted with data measurement and acquisition were deployed to families in rural Malawi in order to evaluate real-life performance of the technology. Initial field-trial results have advocated the viability of the TEG-stove technology for charging low powered electronic devices typically used in developing countries such as Malawi.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"Mini-grids are seen as an important option for increasing access to electricity in non-electrified rural areas where grid-extension is unfeasible. Appropriately dimensioning and constructing mini-grids requires knowledge of electricity usage. There is currently a lack of measured load profiles from mini-grids and the most common method for estimating electricity usage is through appliance data collected via interviews. Thus, this paper compares and investigates the differences between measured daily load profiles and daily load profiles created from appliance data collected through interviews and how the two methods impact the dimensioning and operation of a mini-grid. This is done by comparing load profiles for an entire mini-grid, a household and SME customers with large loads. The paper reports differing results from the two methodologies. Generally, the results show that the interview-based load profiles fail to provide an accurate overall estimate. The calculated performance metrics for the two methods also shows large differences. The interview-based load profiles mainly fail to provide accurate estimates of energy and the energy related (capacity factor and load factor) performance metrics. Accordingly, the implications for mini-grid operators and developers could be significant. The interview-based load profiles indicate the mini-grid system to be considerably less technically and economically desirable than measurements show. Suggestions for how the interview process can be improved are presented.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"The objective of this research is to study the adsorption of biomethane gas by several different absorbents. The ultimate goal was to create a cost effective and safe fuel tank for use in domestic cooking applications in rural Thailand. Biomethane is a cleaned and upgraded fuel derived from biogas. It contains a minimum of 80% methane (v/v) with the remainder composed mostly of carbon dioxide. Specifically, the effects of pressure and temperature on the biomethane adsorption capacity of five different absorbents in a 28 l tank were studied. The pressure ranged between 3 and 9 MPa while the temperature range was 15–25 °C. The results showed that the adsorbent, Activated Carbon 3, had the highest biomethane adsorption capability. At higher pressures, greater biomethane adsorption was observed with the highest adsorption value of 164.3 ± 0.5 g/l obtained at 9 MPa. Temperature had a smaller effect with higher temperatures producing less adsorption. At 9 MPa, as the temperature increased from 15 to 25 °C, the adsorbed biomethane decreased by 8%. The degradation in performance of the adsorbent was investigated and found to be negligible over 500 filling/emptying cycles. The selective adsorption of methane over the other biomethane constituents was investigated and also found to be negligible over 500 cycles. The Langmuir adsorption model was applied to estimate the maximum absorption capacity of each absorbent.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"Hybrid PV/Thermal collector is the collector which produced electricity and hot water or hot air at the same time and working as solar cells and solar heaters.

The existence of the reflectance mirrors lead to increase the temperature of the solar cell, therefore, its value was (92.7 °C) when using lower and upper mirrors with a glass cover, and (76.1 °C) when using only a lower mirror, and (71.35 °C) without reflecting mirrors. The cell surface decreased to (52.75 °C) of the uncooled solar cell. The existence of the reflectors increases the total values of the thermal and electrical efficiencies. The daily total efficiency in average was a result due to use two reflectors was (81.03%), this means a positive effect on the total efficiency, and the effects of the glass cover on the total efficiency is big, the daily average of the total efficiency with and without glass cover was (58.95%) and (49.97%) respectively, these results are accorded with the results of the previous articles.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"In recent years, biodiesel, as a renewable and environment-friendly fuel has emerged as one of the most investigated bio-fuel with a goal to decrease our dependence on petroleum fuels and reduce environmental pollution. The current commercial technique of biodiesel production via transesterification is constrained by high operating cost and energy requirements, long residence time and limited conversion due to equilibrium limitations. On the other hand, the process intensification using the micro-reactor technology demonstrated an excellent performance ascribed to short diffusion distance and high surface area-to-volume ratio that can lead to high heat and mass transfer rates and improved mixing compared to the conventional reactors. This review provides an overview of the current status of biodiesel production in micro-reactors. It includes various types of micro-reactors used in the production of biodiesel, factors affecting the biodiesel production (i.e., temperature, residence time, alcohol to oil molar ratio, micro-channel size, inlet mixer type, internal geometries, co-solvent, catalyst type and concentration). This review also includes the factors affecting the liquid-liquid flow patterns and application of micro-reactor technology in the purification of biodiesel. Some of the critical observations from this review are, 1) inlet mixer type, channel size, and internal channel geometry (zig-zag, omega, and tesla shaped channels) have shown a significant effect on mixing in micro-channels. 2) In case of base-catalyzed transesterification, the biodiesel yield was found to increase up to the reaction temperature of 60–65 °C. 3) Homogeneous alkaline catalyst (NaOH, KOH, CH3ONa) was preferred for the feedstock with low free fatty acid content (<1 wt%). However, an acid catalyst with high concentration, a significant amount of methanol and long reaction time were required for high free fatty acid feedstock (>1 wt%). Therefore, the current research is more focused on the investigation of heterogeneous catalysts in micro-reactors to develop an ecologically friendly process for the production of biodiesel. 4) Also, the reaction temperature and inlet mixer type had shown a significant effect on liquid-liquid flow patterns. This review also addressed the following literature gaps; a numbering-up technique to increase the throughput; catalyst development for high free fatty acid feedstock; continuous production of biodiesel in micro-reactors with in-line purification step to meet the energy demand and quality standards.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"The expanding prepaid electricity meter market is globally characterised by innovation and change. In this article we track persistent and emerging trends in the prepaid electricity market for households. To do this, we review important literature noting the benefits and challenges of prepaid meters overtime. We find two forms of trends – namely the persistent and emerging trend – that currently characterise the prepaid meter related literature and market. The persistent trend in literature and the market is the proclivity to echo the savings on electricity and improved budgeting as important benefits for prepaid metered households. However, a fundamental emerging trend is also identified, wherein it is shown that the past decade there has been an intensifying interest of scholarly literature challenging the notion of prepaid meters and its effect thereof, particularly among indigent households. We therefore primarily recommend that there be a development of prepaid electricity meter regulatory mechanisms geared towards protecting vulnerable households.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"The causal relationships between electrification and development of poor, rural communities are complex and contextual. The existing literature focuses mainly on the impact of rural electrification and electricity use on local socio-economic development, while the reverse feedbacks of various social and economic changes on electricity demand and supply have not been fully characterized. Most electricity access impact assessments assume linear, one-way effects and linear growth in electricity demand. However, the projections rarely match the reality, creating challenges for rural utilities. From a modelling perspective, the lack of attention to dynamic complexities of the electricity-development nexus prevents the appropriate modelling of electricity demand over time and, hence, informed planning for and sizing of power plants. With the goal to improve modelling of the electricity-development nexus, we undertake a comprehensive review and extensive analysis of the peer-reviewed literature on electricity access and its impact on rural socio-economic development, and vice versa. We characterize and describe the nexus between electricity access and development through graphical causal diagrams that allow us to capture, visualise and discuss the complexity and feedback loops. Based on this, we suggest guidelines for developing appropriate models able to include and simulate such complexities.Our analysis confirms that electricity use is interconnected through complex causal relations with multiple dimensions of socio-economic development, viz. income generating activities, market production and revenues, household economy, local health and population, education, and habits and social networks. The causal diagrams can be seen as a first step of the conceptualization phase of model building, which aims at describing and understanding the structure of a system. The presence of multiple uncertain parameters and complex diffusion mechanisms that describe the complex system under analysis suggests that systems-dynamic simulations can allow modelling such complex and dynamic relations, as well as dealing with the high uncertainties at stake, especially when coupled with stochastic approaches.",Volume 43,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/43/suppl/C,6
"The present study aims to contextualize populations without access to modern energy in order to formulate effective policy considerations on modern energy adoption and continuity of usage by target groups. This objective was achieved by illustrating the linkage between fuel choice and energy poverty in low income households in an urban context. It employs a cross-sectional energy stacking model to illustrate fuel choice and the multidimensional energy poverty (MEP) index to establish the severity of energy poverty in low income households in Kisumu City, Kenya. The study also incorporates pico-solar products (PSPs) users, as this disruptive technology entered the Kenyan solar market in recent years, targeting low income households using kerosene for lighting purposes. The study identifies energy appliance type and household cooking location as key determinants of household energy choice. Moreover, the main determinants for household energy choice in households facing higher levels of energy poverty were closely associated with access concerns, whereas determinants in households facing lower levels of energy poverty were more associated with usage concerns as they already had access to modern energy. It was also noted that preferences were related to attributes of the energy source both experienced by current users and perceived by current non-users. There was a substantial persistent use of kerosene as an alternative lighting source among current PSPs users. There is a general preference and desire to use modern energy sources across most households, irrespective of the severity of energy poverty.For meaningful improvement to be realized towards meeting the energy SDG by 2030, national and local energy policies should consider the energy technology adoption perception and behaviours of populations currently not having modern energy access. In conclusion, it is of great importance to put into context the specific characteristics of the households as well as user perspectives and how these characteristics and perspectives would affect continuity of usage of the modern energy source adopted.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"Jatropha curcas has been introduced as a low-cost energy crop in Burkina Faso for the production of straight vegetable oil (SVO) and biodiesel. It is cultivated in different plantation systems including smallholder inter-plantings with annual crops, large-scale monoculture, afforestation on marginal land, in traditional hedge systems along contour stone walls, and in living fences. We performed Life Cycle Assessment of these Jatropha systems using empirical data on yields and carbon stocks, and accounting for changes in agro-ecosystem provisioning and regulating services that occurred after the land conversion to Jatropha. The study found that all J. curcas production pathways substantially reduced greenhouse gas emission (68–89%) and saved energy (65–90%) compared to diesel fuel. Highest values are achievable under the assumption that by-products (husks, seed cake, glycerin) are used for energy generation. The decentralized production of SVO supplied by feedstocks from intercropping and hedgerow systems seems to be most promising option. However, very low land-use efficiency (6.5–9.5 GJ ha− 1 production) characterized Jatropha intercropping and monoculture plantations, rendering the plant a competitor to food crops and increasing the risk of conversion of savanna land to Jatropha cultivation. Jatropha plantings on marginal lands largely failed. High labor requirements constrain integration of Jatropha plantation systems within small farmholdings. Currently, the traditional hedge systems show the lowest land-use replacement potential and labor needs while providing multiple ecosystem services, but alone cannot satisfy rural energy needs. In order to reach energy supply targets without claiming more land and compromising other ecosystem services, the J. curcas plantation systems in Burkina Faso need to be made more efficient through plant breeding and improved agronomic management.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"Appliance labels provide consumers with information on energy usage of appliances and mandatory labeling is an important policy tool for promoting the adoption of efficient appliances. Following global practice, standards and labeling programs have been adopted in India for various appliances since 2006. This paper provides empirical support for this approach, by estimating the value placed by consumers in India on energy labels. The estimates of willingness to pay (WTP) for energy labels and higher efficiency as indicated on labels are obtained using a discrete choice experiment in purchase decisions of air conditioners. A mixed logit model is specified to estimate the parameters for chosen attributes of air conditioners. The results show that consumers place a positive value on the presence of labels. The preference for star rating levels is heterogeneous in the sample. The WTP for higher star rating is estimated which is a useful input in designing other energy efficiency programs in conjunction with the labeling program.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"This paper assesses consumer valuation of different attributes of electricity supply to elucidate the conflict between solar microgrids and the centralized utility grid in India, as well as to provide insight into supporting government policies and structures. The study contributes significantly to the understanding of the role of microgrids in complementing a centralized system and its value as a sustainable energy solution for development.Electricity reliability, power, price, and hours availability are studied through a choice experiment, a method uniquely able to disaggregate the willingness to pay for each attribute. Household surveys were carried out in 22 villages across 4 districts in the state and covering a total of 216 households. Results indicate that consumers value (in order of strength of preference) electricity power, reliability, and price. Further, despite 9.4 h of electricity supply per day from the main grid, as compared to an average of only 7.2 h from microgrids, the respondents exposed to both systems were almost twice as satisfied with the microgrid's reliability. Based on these findings, the study provides four policy recommendations for strengthening the rural electricity supply sector and enhancing electricity access in India.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"This paper examines the role of caste, tribe, and religion in determining energy inequality in India. We provide evidence by using the National Sample Survey Organisation data from the 68th round (2011 − 12) of 87,753 households. We estimate the inequalities in access to Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) and electricity usage by the households belonging to the three major disadvantaged groups in India, viz., the scheduled castes, the scheduled tribes, and the Muslims. The results of our empirical analysis suggest that, after controlling for the determinants which impinge on the households' microeconomic demand and regional supply characteristics, the households belonging to the scheduled tribe and scheduled caste communities do have significantly poorer access to LPG and electricity usage as compared to the upper caste households. The decomposition analysis of average differences in the predicted outcomes shows that it is the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe households who would appear to face most discrimination. The Muslim households too face significant inequality in accessing LPG. Policy implications of the findings are considered.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"We investigate the determinants of distributed solar technology adoption at the village and household level in India. Using spatial data on insolation, census records, and original surveys, we show that remote and poor but large villages with abundant sunshine have led the wave of solar technology adoption as an alternative to grid electricity. At the household level, however, wealth and financial access are positively associated with solar technology adoption, a result that holds for both solar lanterns and home systems. Moreover, remote villages are more likely to see solar technology adoption when households have access to finance through banks. We also find that the use of household solar technology is strongly associated with a household's subjective satisfaction with domestic lighting. These results demonstrate that understanding solar technology adoption requires considering both community and household characteristics. They also underscore the importance of financial access as a precondition for using distributed solar power as an alternative to grid connectivity.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"The lack of predictability in the output of solar, wind, and small hydroelectric power plants aggravates the problem of consistently matching supply with demand on electric grids. In this paper, a database of renewable power injection, at 15-minute intervals during 2010–2014, into the Portuguese electric transmission system is analysed to characterize the variability and other patterns of renewable energy injection into the system. The system, operated by REN (Redes Energéticas Nacionais), received 20–28% of its electricity from the three renewable energy sources (RES) mentioned, with wind contributing about 90% of that amount. A strong complementarity (smoothing effect) between wind and PV was found, with correlation factors of − 0.92 and − 0.83 for typical summer and winter days, respectively. The correlation factors for different time scales decrease from annual totals (− 0.88) to hourly totals (− 0.24), as expected. The results suggest that lower wind power years correspond to sunnier ones.

"The biofuel crop Jatropha curcas has been promoted in developing countries as a means of improving the livelihoods of rural populations. In Mexico, despite the initially assumed economic, environmental, and social benefits of the crop, many farmers have abandoned jatropha cultivation. Here, we analyse the factors that influence farmers' decision to abandon jatropha cultivation by using a generalized linear modelling approach in combination with qualitative research methods. The deterioration in perception of jatropha profitability, the non-payment of expected subsidies and the wealth position of the household played a major role in determining abandonment. The perception of pest and disease damage, although stated by farmers as the second most frequent reason to disadopt, was not correlated with this decision in the generalized linear model. This research might help energy policy makers in identifying key elements to prevent failure of promotion programmes. The result of this study also may be useful for an international audience to reflect on the appropriateness of promoting a new crop at the farmer level before realistically evaluating the economic viability of its cultivation.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"Access to electricity is a key enabler of social and economic development. However, 1.2 billion people still do not benefit from reliable electricity services. Microgrids have been proposed as a cost-effective means to accelerate access for communities located far from existing grid infrastructure. Scarcity of capital has been a barrier to both on-grid and off-grid electrification efforts and governments have sought private sector participation in an effort to close this gap. There is a lack of quantitative analysis to critically evaluate the key drivers of risk in microgrid utilities, or how different business models and technologies affect the potential for these projects to attract finance and scale up deployment. This paper introduces the Stochastic Techno-Economic Microgrid Model (STEMM), which enables assessment of the effect of technical design decisions as well as financial conditions on the financial viability of microgrid projects from an investment perspective. Using STEMM, this paper presents a risk analysis of the key uncertain variables affecting microgrid investments to both debt and equity investors using four technology scenarios as case studies in Rwanda. We find that major contributors to risk are fuel price volatility, uncertain electricity demand, and foreign exchange risk for investments in hard currency. Choice of technology strongly influences the risk profile of microgrids, with solar powered microgrids susceptible to demand uncertainty and diesel-based systems exposed to fuel price volatility. Hybrid solutions provide a middle ground with partial mitigation of both fuel price and demand risk. If electricity tariffs are linked to changes in fuel price, fuel price risk can be effectively passed to consumers.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"Chile's native forests are one of the world's 25 priority conservation ecoregions due to their high levels of endemism and anthropogenic pressure. Seventy percent of these forests are in private lands, and firewood is the main use for native woods (93% of the total timber extracted from native forests). Yet, drivers of firewood production have not been adequately studied. In this research we analyzed if firewood is a primary production goal (the cause of extracting timber from native forest), or it is more a consequence of other processes. 275 surveys with landowners were used to perform a cross-sectional analysis in the Los Rios Region. We found that the decision to produce firewood is positively related to native forest cover (%) in the farm and the presence of forest plantations, and negatively related to the proportion of off-farm income (%). These variables affect the options facing landowners and help assess whether firewood is either a primary part of the productive system, or an outcome from other activities (by-product). The results show that firewood producers are not very responsive to firewood prices and only a small proportion of farms engage in commercial firewood production as their primary activity (landowners are not really interested in firewood production). Further, a growing firewood supply from forest plantations implies a lower pressure on native forests. This suggests that firewood production is less likely to be a driver of forest degradation than the literature points out, although the context of firewood production does identify areas where harvesting activities could be higher, e.g. where there are fewer off-farm income opportunities for landowners, who have lower schooling levels and do not hold formal land tenure, and where governmental interventions could be targeted to reduce excessive pressure on native forests.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7

"In this paper, we estimate the cost reduction potential of parabolic trough based concentrated solar Power systems in India and consequently their implications for levelized cost of electricity. Using the past as well as envisaged global cumulative diffusion of CSP systems and the learning rates reported in the literature, the expected capital cost of parabolic trough based CSP systems in India has been estimated. Present capital cost of parabolic trough based CSP plant in India has been taken as US $2540/kW. Local manufacturing of CSP components and consequently reduced logistics is expected to reduce the capital cost by 14% and 8% respectively. A learning rate of 10% for the global cumulative diffusion in the base case scenario is expected to reduce capital cost to 49% of the present cost by the end of 2050. Present LCOE of US $151/MWh of CSP plant in India is expected to reduce to US $76/MWh by the end of 2050. Provision of 6 hour thermal storage is expected to reduce LCOE of CSP plant in India by 18% as compared to LCOE of CSP plant without storage. Analysis for different learning rates (5%, 10% and 15%) for CSP plant and different discount rates (6%, 8% and 10%) has also been undertaken and results obtained are presented.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"There are a number of methods to help reduce the exposure to household air pollution associated with using biomass fuel for daily cooking and heating in nearly 40% of global households. These most commonly include use of cleaner fuels and cookstoves, increasing ventilation, and use of a chimney. This paper investigates two less-commonly considered methods, 1) reducing exposure through filtration and capture of PM2.5 and 2) avoiding emissions using retained heat for cooking. If cookstoves are operated inside an enclosure from which smoke is pulled by a fan through an inexpensive HEPA-type filter before exiting to the outside, the personal exposure levels, room concentrations, and external pollution might be reduced. To test this method, an enclosure was built from which a box fan pulled the air and PM2.5 through a filter, and four different filters were tested. The rate of PM2.5 production (mg/min) exiting the filter was monitored with gravimetric measurement under an emissions hood during the high and low power phases of the Water Boiling Test 4.2.3 conducted on a biomass rocket stove with forced draft. The average of seven baseline emissions tests with no filter was 7.5 mg/min of PM2.5. The average of seven tests using the highest quality furnace filter (3 M 2200) was reduced to 1.5 mg/min and the difference was significant at 95% confidence. The use of retained heat to simmer also reduced emissions of PM2.5 to zero by burning the boil-phase-made-charcoal while 5 l of water were simmered for 35 min.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"Japan's energy market has seen the siting and construction of over 2800 new mega-solar power plants since the introduction of the Feed-in Tariff policy in 2012 (Kitamoto, 2017). While scholars have highlighted the potential for community-engaged renewable power development with social benefits for local residents, many major mega-solar projects have instead resulted from industry-led initiatives in locations, largely avoiding community engagement. In this study, we draw from distributive energy justice perspectives to analyze social equity impacts of the mega-solar siting process. We employ qualitative content analysis on 29 survey responses from local officials around Japan's 200 largest mega-solar plants constructed since 2012 and contextualize results through 18 interviews with relevant actors in six case studies. We find that given the existence of the Feed-in Tariff and sufficient solar irradiation, the availability of underutilized land decreases community bargaining power compared to historical power plant siting agreements. This results in primarily land leasing benefits and municipal tax revenue with minimal additional social impacts, such as employment. We outline a model of causation for mega-solar social equity impacts, Japanese policy implications, and directions for future quantitative research.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"Development and implementation of clean cooking technology for households in low and middle income countries (LMICs) offer enormous promise to advance at least five Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): 3. Good health and well-being; 5. Gender equality; 7. Affordable and clean energy; 13. Climate action; 15. Life on land. Programs are being implemented around the world to introduce alternative cooking technologies, and we are well on the way to achieving the goal set by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to reach 100 million homes with cleaner and more efficient cooking methods by 2020. Despite evidence that household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuel combustion is responsible for 3–4 million early deaths per year, many cookstove programs are motivated and/or financed by climate change mitigation schemes and deploy alternative stoves that use solid fuels such as wood and charcoal. However, recent studies have demonstrated that improved biomass-burning stoves typically only incrementally improve air quality and yield modest or minimal health benefits. Likewise, their contributions to climate change mitigation and other SDGs may be limited. Evidence indicates that cleaner fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol and biogas, offer greater potential benefits not only to health, but also greater progress towards climate goals and other relevant SDGs. We present a modeled estimate of these potential gains for a diverse group of 40 LMICs. Our model suggests that cookstove programs using LPG stoves and fuel will yield greater reductions in both Disability Adjusted Life Years and Global Warming Commitment in these countries than those using improved biomass stoves. Cost and infrastructure requirements for clean fuels such as LPG are widely recognized constraints. In view of these constraints we present an analytical method to simultaneously consider health and climate needs at the national level for the same 40 countries in the context of estimated LPG expansion potentials. Comparative analyses integrating priorities across SDGs at the national and regional levels may guide more practical and effective household energy development choices going forward.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"Worldwide, the annual energy content of sugarcane leaves (SCL) amounts to 4.21 EJ. However, its direct use as a solid fuel is hindered by its inherent characteristics, such as its low bulk density, low energy density, and hygroscopic nature. These characteristics of SCL could be improved through torrefaction. However, in addition to these characteristics, combustion and flow characteristics, expressed in their respective indices, should also meet their desired values as they have direct influence in the later performance of boilers and furnaces. Torrefaction of SCL at various temperatures (250–350 °C) and times (0–75 min) under minimized oxidative atmosphere was investigated in this study to improve its characteristics as solid fuel. The torrefaction performance was not only assessed through the mass and energy yields, but also changes in the combustion and flow indices. Torrefaction at 300 °C & 45 min led to the increase in fixed carbon to as much as 21 g for every 100 g of raw SCL being torrefied, which originally contains 18 g of fixed carbon. Devolatilization during torrefaction not only involves the volatilization of the volatiles but also the formation of additional fixed carbon. The higher heating value (HHV) of SCL increased to as much as ~ 22 MJ/kg after the torrefaction. The resulting SCL torrefied at 300 °C for at least 45 min was found to be suitable for industrial and domestic applications having fuel ratio (FR), combustibility index (CI), volatile ignitability (VI), Hausner ratio (HR), and Carr compressibility index (CCI) falling within prescribed values of 0.5–2.0, 12–23 MJ/kg, > 14 MJ/kg, < 1.34, and < 25, respectively.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"Jatropha curcas L. is considered a promising candidate plant for biofuel production. However, data on its seed yield seem to vary greatly in different parts of the globe. Some studies indicate that low genetic diversity might be an important factor causing seed yield variation. In addition to genetic factors, abiotic factors such as rainfall or agronomic practices (e.g. planting density) may influence seed yield. Our study focused on reviewing current data on genetic diversity and other factors behind seed yield variability of J. curcas in different parts of its range, including areas both in its native and non-native range. Genetic and seed yield data were collected from published and unpublished documents available online. Our review shows that genetic diversity is significantly higher within its native range than in areas where the species has been introduced. Genetic diversity had a significant positive correlation with the mean annual seed yield. Seed yield varied greatly across the globe. Global mean (± SE) seed yield was 2218 ± 148 kg ha− 1 y− 1. Age of the plants had positive linear effects, whereas annual rainfall and plant density had quadratic effects on seed yield at global scale. The reported low genetic diversity in the non-native range of J. curcas may be explained by a low number of common ancestors and the resulting founder effect. The large variability in seed yields across the globe is probably caused by differences in plant age, varying agronomic practices, site specific climates, soil fertility and genetic factors. Although in a large proportion of Jatropha plantations worldwide the threshold level for economically feasible seed yield (2500 kg ha− 1 y− 1 or more) may not be achieved, other benefits provided by Jatropha (e.g. carbon sequestration, erosion control) may support its cultivation even on arid or semi-arid sites.",Volume 42,February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/42/suppl/C,7
"Auctions have recently been regarded as a useful alternative to other support schemes for the setting of the remuneration of renewable electricity (RES-E) worldwide. However, whether auctions will fulfill the expectations depends on the choice of design elements. The aim of this article is to analyze the advantages and drawbacks of different design elements according to different criteria. We support our analysis with economic theory and identify best and worst practices in the design of RES-E auctions from around the world. Our findings show that a few design elements score better than the alternatives in some criteria, without scoring worse in others. These “best” practices include a schedule of auctions, volume disclosure, price ceilings, penalties, streamline of administrative procedures and provision of information to potential participants. Design elements usually involve trade-offs between criteria. Overall, these results suggest that the choice of a specific design element is not a win-win decision and depends on the priorities of the respective government.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"The majority of households in Burkina Faso, particularly in the rural areas, rely on fuelwood as their main source of energy for cooking and heating. This consumption trend is expected to continue and even increase in the coming years, driven mainly by the population growth. Although sustainable woodfuel management has been considered in the country, pressure on forest resources is continuously increasing, as a result of fuelwood production. In this study, the different processes within the fuelwood value chain (FWVC) were analyzed in the village of Cassou and Ouagadougou, with a survey directed to the FWVC actors (from harvesters to consumers). Social, economic and environmental aspects were considered in the analysis, as well as the legal dimension within the VC. From the analysis, two lines of formality were identified (i.e. formal and informal). Formality varied depending on the location and the process implying also a gender aspect; for instance, all harvesters and most of the collectors (mainly men) in Cassou belonged to associations (formal), while most of the transporters and traders (mainly women) in Ouagadougou were not part of any association (informal). Fuelwood price fluctuation was also affected by the formality since formal actors followed the official prices while informal ones established the prices freely. Informality also leads to uncontrolled exploitation of forest resources contributing to the forest decline. The present study provides a general overview of the situation in Cassou, a small village in Burkina Faso and suggests that other issues need to be considered to fully assess the sustainability of fuelwood VC in the country and to be able to create strategies and policies to e.g. decrease the negative impact on the environment. Therefore, it would be most needed to carry out a detailed analysis, involving formality, with all the actors – covering gender issues, processes and flows at a larger scale across different regions.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"The Brazilian government has plans to build 26 large hydropower plants in the Amazon basin between 2013 and 2028. These plants will have a total installed capacity of 44 GW, 9000 km2 of reservoir area, and a total cost of US$ 30–70 billion. In this paper we aim to evaluate alternative generation pathways to avoid the adverse social and environmental impacts associated with reservoirs in the Amazon. Specifically we model the Brazilian electricity network under five capacity expansion scenarios. We assumed the government expansion plans as the baseline and created alternative scenarios where wind and natural gas power plants replace large Amazonian hydropower plants. We compared the scenarios using several performance indicators: greenhouse gas emissions, land use, capital and operational costs, wind curtailments, and energy storage in the hydropower reservoirs. The simulations suggest that a more aggressive policy towards wind generation than the baseline has the potential to replace Amazon hydropower providing advantages to the system operation (e.g., higher storage in hydropower reservoirs). However, when installed wind capacity reaches 24% to 28% of the total installed capacity, more thermal generation is required to balance the hydro-wind variability, increasing the operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions compared to the baseline.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"Energy shortages and CO2 emissions reductions are critical contemporary challenges for Thailand. A consumption-based analysis provides crucial information that enables policymakers to more comprehensively understand the hidden contributors of energy demand and CO2 in the economy. The other manufacturing, construction and food and beverage sectors were amongst the five largest contributors to energy use and emissions in both 2000 and 2010, based on a consumption perspective. However, these sectors have been neglected by energy conservation and climate change mitigation policies in Thailand because they were the least energy-intensive sectors per government energy reports from 1995 to 2015. The CO2 emissions burden from exports was almost 50% of Thailand's national CO2 inventory in 2000 and 2010. The embodied CO2 emissions results revealed that Thailand could reduce its emissions inventory by 12% and 13% if embodied imports replaced exports in 2000 and 2010, respectively. Furthermore, the leading gross domestic product-generating industries in Thailand are seriously vulnerable to natural gas and crude oil shortages despite some sectors using them in small proportions in their production processes. Energy and emissions policies should better reflect consumption characteristics to increase the potential of energy-saving interventions and CO2 mitigation.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"The power generated from TEG is relatively unstable owing to temperature variations at its hot and cold side terminals. The dc-dc converters can provide more stable power output thereby improving the overall efficiency of TEG system. However, to facilitate better performance improvement, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm can be applied to extract maximum power from TEG system. Therefore, parameter analysis of a TEG/dc-dc converter system in different modes is being carried out. A TEG-dc-dc boost converter model is analysed in both MPPT and direct pulse width modulation (PWM) modes subjected to a variable load. To further study the capability of dc-dc converters to stabilise the TEG power output, increasing ramp and random hot side temperature is applied to the MPPT and direct PWM based modes so that the effect on output parameters i.e. voltage and power, can be analysed. It is noted that even for the random temperature input to the TEG, the output voltage resulting from the converter is almost constant. Therefore dc-dc converters are able to stabilise the power generated from TEG. It is also observed that dc-dc converter with MPPT based model is able to effectively extract the maximum power without having to adjust any component from the MPPT algorithm as it is the case with direct PWM based model. From the study, it has been established that proper selection of converter components is necessary to reduce converter losses as well interferences on the load connected to TEG-dc-dc converter system.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"The relationship between technology change and carbon dioxide emissions is complex. Existing research has emphasized technology progress in reducing carbon emission intensity but has ignored the impact of technology progress on economic growth, which leads to changes in carbon dioxide emissions. We argue that technology has relatively independent economic and environmental attributes. To provide evidence for this, we developed a method to distinguish the scale effect of technology change and its influence on economic scale from the intensity effect of technology change and its influence on carbon emission intensity. We applied this method to study the impact of technology change on carbon dioxide emissions in 95 countries between 1996 and 2007. We found that technology change indeed reduced aggregate carbon dioxide emissions, but the scale and intensity effects of technology change separately expressed positive and negative values. As a consequence, previous studies that only consider the intensity effect overestimate the impact of technology change on carbon dioxide emissions. Our findings yield important considerations for carbon dioxide emissions control in policy making.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"Improved solid fuel cookstoves have been a focus of development efforts to address health and environmental problems caused by traditional cooking practices in Kenya. However, a review of Kenya's experience in promoting improved solid fuel cookstoves shows that the focus has been on (increasing) production and dissemination of improved cookstoves, overlooking the fact that some of the disseminated cookstoves are used less regularly or even abandoned. This study examines factors that influence the usage rate of improved solid fuel cookstoves, drawing on a survey of cookstove users conducted in Kenya through a project implemented by the African Centre for Technology Studies (ACTS) and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). The results show that sustained use of improved solid fuel cookstoves over time is significantly predicted by awareness creation activities and reputation of the new cookstoves among community members. These insights suggest that cookstove-disseminating organisations should pay attention to these two factors to ensure sustained use of improved solid fuel cookstoves in Kenya and perhaps other developing countries.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"Mini-grids for rural electrification in developing countries are growing in popularity but are not yet widely deployed. A key barrier of mini-grid proliferation is the uncertainty in predicting customer electricity consumption, which adds financial risk. Energy-use surveys deployed in the pre-feasibility stage that capture present and aspirational consumption are intended to reduce this uncertainty. However, the general reliability and accuracy of these surveys has not been demonstrated. This research compares survey-predicted electrical energy use to actual measured consumption of customers of eight mini-grids in rural Kenya. A follow-up audit compares the aspirational inventory of appliances to the realized inventory. The analysis shows that the ability to accurately estimate past consumption based on survey or audit data, even in a relatively short time-horizon is prone to appreciable error — a mean absolute error of 426 Wh/day per customer on a mean consumption of 113 Wh/day per customer. An alternative data-driven proxy village approach, which uses average customer consumption from each mini-grid to predict consumption at other mini-grids, was more accurate and reduced the mean absolute error to 75 Wh/day per customer. Hourly load profiles were constructed to provide insight into potential causes of error and to suggest how the data provided in this work can be used in computer-aided mini-grid design programs.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"There is a critical need for developing wood-burning cookstoves lab tests that better reflect their field performance, and that can be used to complement existing standard tests. This is particularly true for Plancha-type cookstove stoves, widely disseminated in Latin America, where existing tests, like Water Boiling Test (WBT) and Controlled Cooking Test (CCT), are either not well suited to these stoves or do not capture the simultaneous and sequential arrangement of local cooking practices –i.e., multi-pot cooking, pre-heating of meals, and use of residual heat. In this paper, we developed a “controlled cooking cycle” or “controlled burning cycle” (CBC) test to study the benefits, in terms of fuelwood and pollutants emissions savings, of multi-pot cooking arising from the integration of cooking tasks. Tests were conducted on the Patsari stove, a plancha-type stove that has been widely disseminated in Mexico and in other regions of Central America. We first used CCTs to evaluate the comparative energy and emissions performance of the Patsari stove relative to a traditional U-shaped open fire (U-type) for the most common cooking practices carried out in the Purepecha Region of Michoacan. We also compared results from the CBC multi-pot cooking with results from simply conducting the cooking tasks in series. All the CCTs and CBCs were carried out in a simulated kitchen at GIRA facilities in Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Mexico with two local cooks who performed all the cooking tasks in the traditional/typical manner of the region. Results from CCTs showed Patsari benefits relative to the open fires, in terms of fuelwood consumption and CO and PM2.5 emissions savings, vary among cooking tasks and range from negligible to 63% depending on the parameter and the task. The sequential cooking and integration of these tasks in a CBC result in average savings of 65% for CO, 65% for PM2.5 and 35% for fuelwood relative to the U-type, and of between 30% and 44% savings with respect to simply conducting the cooking tasks in series in the same stove. The CBC fuelwood savings obtained here are comparable with field results from Kitchen Performance Tests (KPT) conducted regionally by other authors. The results confirm that multi-pot cooking and a smart sequential integration of tasks developed by local users are key to achieve the maximum benefits from plancha-type stoves, and need to be much better reflected in standard lab tests.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"Developing countries are grappling with how to reduce household air pollution (HAP) from cooking with solid fuels and the traditional three stone fire (TSF). Laboratory studies have shown that improved cookstoves may offer reductions in fuel use, emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), yet there is limited evidence from “real-world” settings showing how improved stoves perform compared to the traditional TSF. Our study takes place in a semi-controlled setting in Malawi and was designed to quantify fuel efficiency improvements and air pollutant concentration reductions capabilities of two improved cookstoves. We perform a Water Boiling Test to compare the TSF with the locally produced clay stove known as the Chitetezo Mbaula (CM) and the Philips gasifying stove. We find that the CM uses 53% of the fuel used by the traditional TSF, and produces 59% of CO, and 50% of PM2.5 of the TSF. The Philips stove uses 31% of the fuel, and produces 38% of CO, and 22% of PM2.5 of the TSF. We consider the potential for the wide-scale adoption of these technologies given their relative costs and conclude that lower-cost, intermediate quality cookstoves are an important and realistic first step toward reducing HAP.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"This study focused on black saxaul (Haloxylon aphyllum) and tamarisk (Tamarix hispida), which are economically and environmentally important trees in one of the most arid parts of the Aral region. Black saxaul is the main local fuelwood species. However, its extraction was banned after it became critically endangered in the 1990s. Planting this species is now regarded as essential for rehabilitating the Aralkum Desert in light of the Aral Sea crisis. Tamarisk is another fuelwood species that supports local livelihoods. We administered questionnaires among residents in Karateren district and conducted interviews with some residents and with policymakers responsible for regulating forest management. The findings revealed a significantly higher preference for black saxaul than for tamarisk among residents, with a high potential demand for the former. Moreover, some residents observed a decrease in tamarisk biomass, which could accelerate as a result of constant population growth in the study district. We recommend conducting an assessment of logging sites and establishing a feedback system involving local communities to develop risk management that can address future shortages in wood supplies and over logging. Political decision making should also consider the uneven preferences of residents of this region for fuelwood species.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"A design methodology, its validation and evaluation, for optimal electric energy power management NCRE (NonConventional Renewable Energy) converters used for battery charging is presented, targeting small-scale units (i.e. < 10 kW). It is a general-purpose solution that has been tested with different prime movers: river turbine, tidal turbine, wind turbine, and wave energy converter. There are two critical components in the configuration: the electric generator, and the buck converter or MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracker). The design of these two components must give careful consideration to the behavior of the primary energy source as well as battery charging requirements. The topology selected for the generator is an axial flux generator with permanent magnets, because it allows matching the low optimal speed of the primary energy converters without the use of speed multipliers such as gears and pulleys. The programmable buck converter topology is selected because it can be used both as a voltage or current source, and hence it works well with battery charging,which is a primary application for small-scaleoff-gridNCRE converters. Cost-effectiveness of the solution is achieved by the simple design methods, low cost components and materials, and simple manufacturing methods.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"Small-scale hydropower systems are mainly used in remote locations for generating electricity where reasonable hydropower resources are available. Many small-scale systems employ crossflow turbines due to their simplicity in design and manufacture, low cost, sturdy construction and longer life-span. However, compared to most advanced and efficient designs, such as Pelton and Francis turbines, they suffer from a lower maximum efficiency. In a crossflow turbine, the nozzle increases the velocity of the flow and directs it at a suitable angle to the runner whose axis is tangential to the flow. The runner extracts the angular momentum of the flow. Therefore, the runner entry flow is critical for the turbine efficiency. However, it is not yet known clearly how the entry flow affects the runner performance and how the best nozzle can be designed. This study presents a new nozzle design method so that high efficiency crossflow turbines can be designed. An analytical model is formulated to convert the head into kinetic energy at the entry and obtain a suitable flow angle. Three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations were conducted on a 7 kW turbine with a measured maximum efficiency of 69% and a 0.53 kW turbine with a maximum efficiency of 88%. The predictive capability of the computational model was assessed by comparing the computational and experimental results for the power over a range of operating conditions on both turbines. By redesigning only the nozzle of the 7 kW turbine by the new method, the maximum efficiency increased from 69% to 87%. Thus the nozzle design has a significant influence on turbine performance, and we conclude that the conversion of head into kinetic energy and matching of the nozzle flow with the runner design are fundamental in turbine design.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"The residential sector is the third largest energy-consuming sector in Mexico and an important contributor to energy related carbon dioxide emissions after transport and industry. The objective of this study is to evaluate the implementation and social acceptance of energy efficient technologies and renewable technologies in the so called sustainable social housing program in Mexico City, and compare the real reduction of CO2 emissions to the theoretical potential. To do so, two estimations are developed: 1) the technical and economic CO2 emission reduction potential of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in new social housing in Mexico City, and 2) the real avoided emissions based on social acceptance of technologies obtained by housing surveys and physical revision of performance status of implemented technologies. We found that due to lack of information and training to households an important part of dwellers ended up rejecting mitigation technologies developing what we called the socially neglected effect of mitigation technologies. These results were used to estimate three scenarios for year 2025: baseline, mitigation and neglected effect. Due to the neglected effect a reduction of 25% with respect to the baseline scenario was obtained instead of 45% of emission reduction in year 2025. In the case of efficient lighting and refrigerators, where Minimum Energy Efficient Standards are in place the socially neglected effect disappears once the replacement of old to new technologies takes place. This result shows that minimum energy performance standards are the main mitigation policy to eliminate socially neglected effect in the long run. Obligatory standards for installation of solar water heaters can be developed as well, although it is important to develop additional follow-up policies for adequate installation of these technologies.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8
"This research aims at finding the optimal orientation regarding exposure and transfer of insolation energy in high-rise residential buildings for space conditioning in Sulaimani city, Iraq. A hypothetical high-rise residential building will be studied that has 18 possible orientations and four apartments per floor. Annual Insolation Value (AIV) for each 5° orientation is calculated based on the sun path diagram, linear interpolation and published direct insolation data by NASA. These values were used to calculate AIV for each floor. Different glazing areas, cross section types and glass panes were examined to determine their effect on the fraction of AIV transferred inside the envelope. The results showed that the orientation 70°–160°, 160°–250°, 250°–340° and 70°–340° is the optimal orientation for the four apartments collectively per floor and a whole building. It was also found that the square shaped floor plan of W/L ratio 1:1 has an optimal shape concerning AIV. The common cross section used in the city transferred 20.0% of the AIV inside the building for all orientations. The accumulative annual fraction transferred is negative, which implies excess or shortage of insolation energy based on Heating and Cooling Degree Days. Because of direct proportional relationship, the orientation optimization was not sensitive to variation in both window-wall ratio (WWR) of 20, 25, 30 and 35% and for CMU and brick wall materials. Increasing WWR by 5%, tends to increase the amount of solar heat transfer by 3%. It was found that the heat transfer ratio between conduction through the wall material to radiation through the glazing panes was 1:5.7. The number of glass panes projected the highest effect on the fraction of AIV transferred inside from 20.0% for two panes to 32.5% for one. The results of examining case studies in Sulaimani showed that their orientations deviate notably (except one complex) from the optimal case. Also none of the case studies used the optimal 1:1 ratio which resulted in high increase in the AIV value per each project separately.",Volume 41,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/41/suppl/C,8

The information in the review, which is mostly in chronological order, is obtained from governmental and non-governmental reports, patents and journals written in the area of injera baking stoves. The most important results of the review show that a number of efforts were undertaken to improve injera baking stoves, though there were no organized reviews earlier to show the efforts made by various institutions. The review also shows that other alternative energy sources for injera baking stoves have been used to address the problem of the majority of the people living in rural areas.

"This work describes the behaviour of a vertical axis Savonius Wind Turbine (SWT) in Four-way lane highways during South-West and North-East monsoons. A vertical axis SWT was designed and fabricated using low-cost materials. Starting behaviour of the SWT was studied by measuring and calculating the starting torque coefficient. The proposed SWT's cut-in speed was achieved at a velocity of 3.5 m/s. Experiments were carried out on a four-way lane highway through the placement of turbine at two different positions (middle and sides of the highway). Also, the experiments were repeated during different monsoons to understand the behaviour under different wind directions. Error analysis was performed on the data obtained by considering possible measurement errors and instrument accuracies. The obtained experimental data clearly illustrates that the SWT's nominal rotational speed varies at different monsoons, when located at the sides of the road. From the data analysis, it can be understood that the wind directions play a key role for harnessing maximum amount of energy in highway wind-energy generation. Maximum augmented rotational speed of around 64% was achieved by placing the SWT at the median of Four-way lane highways in different monsoons.",Volume 40,October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/40/suppl/C,9
"Anaerobic digestion is a potential renewable energy, climate independent and robust technology, which is able to treat different kinds of organic wastes and by-products. This study investigated the anaerobic co-digestion of meat and bone meal (MBM) with dairy manure (DM) and crude glycerol (CG). Three sets of batch experiments were conducted at mesophilic condition; one set of anaerobic mono-digestion and two sets of anaerobic co-digestion. In experiment I, each substrate was mono-digested at inoculum to substrate ratio of 1. In experiment II, MBM and DM were co-digested at ratios of 1.0:1.0, 1.0:2.0, 1.0:1.0, and 2.0:1.0, while in experiment III CG was co-digested with MBM at ratios of 1.0:3.0, 1.0:1.0 and 3.0:1.0, at a fixed amount of DM. The results of anaerobic mono-digestion showed that CG produced the highest methane yield (0.48 L/gVS) followed by MBM (0.41 L/gVS) and DM (0.17 L/gVS). In the anaerobic co-digestions, methane yield increased with the increase of MBM content, while it increased together with CG content. The kinetic studies showed that the physico-chemical characteristics of the co-digested substrates influenced hydrolysis rate constant and lag-phase, which increased with the increase of CG content. However, synergistic effect was decreased when MBM content was increased, whereas the opposite was observed to that with CG. Therefore, carbon to nitrogen ratio was an important parameter determining synergistic effect in anaerobic co-digestion, while the physico-chemical characteristics influenced the hydrolysis rate constant and lag-phase.",Volume 40,October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/40/suppl/C,9
"Against the background of rising energy demand and climate change, solar energy applications are expected to become one of the fastest growing sources in India. To support India's solar policy and to respond to a growing demand for high-accuracy solar resource data a new solar resource atlas was created in the study presented. To derive temporal and spatial consistent datasets measured values from 51 ground measurement stations distributed over the whole country were used to derive site-specific correction factors. Another 61 stations were used to validate the resulting maps of long-term monthly-averaged datasets. Correlation factors were transferred to the needed spatial extent using geospatial interpolation and used to adjust satellite-derived data sets with a resolution of approx. 3 × 3 km. Solar datasets created based on the years 1999 to 2014 provide a comprehensive overview of solar resources in India. Long-term averages, annual averages for each month of the year, as well as standard deviations, are presented for all three components of irradiation. The results show that the adjustment using monthly correlation factors significantly improves the quality of long-term estimations from satellite-derived sources and reduces the associated uncertainty.",Volume 40,October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/40/suppl/C,9
"A downstream wind turbine located within the reach of the wake region of an upstream wind turbine experiences a decrease in power output due to wake effects. For this reason, when designing a wind farm, various engineering wake models are used to predict the power deficit and wind farm layout is designed in the optimal way to minimize the wake losses. Generally, in the process of calculating the loss of wind farm AEP, in most cases the single point-measured wind speed is used. However, this results in an error when predicting the loss of AEP under wake conditions. When predicting the AEP of a wind turbines affected by wakes, the rotor equivalent wind speed (REWS), which considers the effect of wake wind shear, should be applied. This research examined REWSpower converted from the power output of a wind turbine to demonstrate the need of rotor equivalent wind speed under upstream turbine's wake condition and furthermore suggested a method to calculate REWSspws using the nacelle-measured wind speed. By analyzing 48 months collected data of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system from a wind farm, error percentages among REWSpower, REWSspws, and the nacelle-measured wind speed were compared.",Volume 40,October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/40/suppl/C,9
"Photovoltaic stand-alone systems are largely regarded as a viable option for decentralized rural electrification in developing countries. However, literature review reveals lack of documented experiences with installed PV systems such as Solar home systems as well as general problems with system maintenance and battery up keeping. This paper presents results from monitoring 31 stand-alone PV systems in remote health posts of North Gondar Zone in Ethiopia from installation until system failure; several systematic factors were found to have contributed to failure: lack of clear responsibility for the systems due to regular job rotation among health workers and lack of upfront, gender sensitive training, lack of equipment for maintenance work, very slow and unreliable chain of information in case of system failure and costly double tracking of energy supply. Nonfunctioning PV systems were found to threaten the technology'’s reputation by word of mouth. The results gained in this research provide important lessons for future programs of rural electrification by means of PV systems: they stress the importance of awareness building amongst funding agencies as well as the imperative of intense and sensitive training for users, especially women, and advocate for considering living conditions of users in system design.",Volume 40,October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/40/suppl/C,9
"This paper examined the behaviour of households regarding electric energy use in lighting, clothes washing, ironing, refrigerating, cooking and boiling of water in relation to electricity billing systems in Ibadan. The rational choice theory, augmented by sociological and psychological theories, forms the theoretical basis for this study. The purposive sampling method was used to select five LGAs in Ibadan, where 500 households were randomly selected. Cross tabulation technique was adopted to analyse the objectives. Regarding the use of electricity for lighting, the result showed that the metered electricity consumers have better energy saving behaviour than the unmetered consumers, while the postpaid meter users have more of energy wasting behaviour compared to the prepaid meter users. For washing clothes and ironing, the result showed that the unmetered customers have more energy wasting behaviour compared to metered customers. Also regarding the behaviour about the use of electricity for washing clothes and ironing, the postpaid users are more energy wasting. Lastly, while the unmetered electricity consumers are more energy wasting in the use of electric cooker, it is the metered consumers that have energy wasting behaviour in the use of refrigerators.",Volume 40,October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/40/suppl/C,9
"A critical analysis of characteristic and building design was done through scaled drawing and observation from a site visit of twelve residential college buildings in the University of Malaya campus. The elements of passive mode were implemented as matrixes or criteria for the recent practice of bioclimatic design strategies. The performance of electricity usage was audited based on the Energy Efficiency Index (EEI) in kWh/m2/year unit of each residential college building for the duration of nine years. As a result, the average electricity usage varied from 24 to 120 kWh/m2/year. The residential colleges that have appropriate practices of passive mode particularly internal courtyard and balconies that encourage daylighting and natural ventilation were found to achieve a desired efficient use of electricity, in the range of 24 to 34 kWh/m2/year.",Volume 40,October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/40/suppl/C,9
"This work focused on the synthesis of charcoal as carbonaceous catalyst support for the ethanol transesterification of vegetable oil to produce biodiesel. Shea (Vitellaria paradoxa) nut shells (SNS) were used as raw material to prepare an activated carbon based catalyst by chemical activation with potassium hydroxide (KOH). A central composite design of the response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the interactive effect of the SNS-K catalyst synthesis parameters (pyrolysis temperature, residence time and KOH impregnation ratio) and its catalytic activity in sunflower ethanol transesterification. Experimental yields reached > 90% ester content in the biodiesel, with a catalyst prepared under mild pyrolysis conditions. Results showed that the temperature of pyrolysis and the KOH ratio used to impregnate SNS are the most important factors influencing the SNS-K catalytic activity. Catalyst prepared between 400 °C and 650 °C, with 120 min residence time and a biomass: KOH ratio of between 14% and 17.5% produced the highest ethyl ester content (96%) with an optimal catalyst prepared at 650 °C, with 120 min residence time and 14% KOH loading. SNS-K catalyst characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed potassium carbonate to be the main active potassium species responsible for catalytic activity. Recyclability tests showed that the catalyst can be reused after a thermal post treatment without catalytic activity loss. Thus, this new simple catalytic process allows biodiesel production under mild conditions, using local reactant (i.e. bioethanol, vegetable oils and char from local agricultural residues). This can be a realistic alternative process for a shift towards sustainable energy in sub-Saharan Africa.",Volume 40,October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/40/suppl/C,9
"In East Africa, charcoal and firewood will remain the main sources of energy for cooking for the next two to three decades. Corresponding energy policies are needed that set proper priorities and improve the sustainability of the biomass energy sector. In this paper, we assess the supply potentials of wood-based and non-woody biomass fuels in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania, and formulate recommendations to support sustainable biomass energy strategies in East Africa.We differentiate between tree types of potentials: the supply potential, the access potential, and the production potential. In order to calculate these potentials, we use a spatial Bayesian network that specifically enables accounting for uncertainties in the data and model.The main results show: (1) that agroforestry and small-scale mixed farming are the land use types with the highest potentials, (2) that firewood, charcoal, and biogas have substantial potential, whereas crop residue briquettes and Jatropha oil have only minor potentials, and (3) that such estimates can be subject to substantial uncertainties.Based on these results, we recommend that biomass energy strategies in East Africa consider the specific assets and limiting factors of the various fuel types and land use types in order to improve the supply of sustainable biomass cooking fuels.",Volume 40,October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/40/suppl/C,9
"An ecosystem services perspective can provide a useful means of understanding, in human well-being terms, the type, scale and value of environmental impacts deriving from the deployment of renewable energy technologies. This paper provides the first thematic review of the ecosystem service impacts commonly associated with developing geothermal areas for power projects. In this study, the typical ecosystem service impacts of geothermal power projects are classified using the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) typology. Next, in order to develop a guide for future practitioners, an analysis is conducted of the most suitable valuation methods for the respective ecosystem service impacts. A pluralist approach is advised to aide decision-making, involving the use of monetary and non-monetary information. A number of non-market valuation studies may be required to estimate the total economic value of affected geothermal ecosystems, likely including the contingent valuation and travel cost methods. The more intangible ecosystem services associated with geothermal areas, such as artistic inspiration and landscape aesthetics, are best valued using non-monetary approaches, including deliberative methods. Finally, in recognition of the importance of having a strong physical basis underpinning non-market valuation techniques, this paper critically assesses the merits of the most appropriate data sources for future environmental economists working in a geothermal context. A literature review reveals that neither Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) nor Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) studies in a geothermal context have embedded an ecosystem service perspective into their processes. EIA are closest to fulfilling the needs of environmental economists, encompassing the majority of ecosystem service impacts, yet further methodological progress is recommended to ensure that all project stakeholders are given voice and arbitrage in the data-gathering process.",Volume 40,October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/40/suppl/C,9
"Residential coal consumption has decreased significantly since 1990 in most developed and developing countries, due to fuel switching. However, there are still countries with a high proportion of households using coal for heating purposes, in some cases with increasing coal consumption trends. This review discusses the patterns of the coal use, associated emissions, the negative impacts on health, and the policies and interventions used to limit the negative effects of high residential coal use. The patterns of residential coal use in those selected countries that account for 86% of global residential coal consumption are reviewed. Interventions in these selected countries have been accessed. It appears that the World Health Organization (WHO) may substantially underestimate the health impacts in these countries, particularly with respect to the burden of disease from household air pollution from using solid fuel for cooking as the indicator of exposure. The alternative to the WHO approach uses International Energy Agency (IEA) data because it provides the energy consumption for each country by fuel type and all household end-uses in a consistent framework. National survey data on energy and emissions also provides better metrics of exposure. Most of the assessed studies in developed countries focused on ambient air pollution, while in developing countries indoor air pollution was given primary attention (except for Mongolia). The PM concentrations within households using coal in Ireland, Mongolia, and China were compared and substantial differences were found as a result of differences in ventilation, stove design, fuel quality and stove maintenance and operation. Policy measures such as the large stove switching programs in China and Mongolia were mostly successful, but did not fully reach desired targets because of several factors. One of these key factors was the variability of human behavior and its response to the policy stimuli. Important barriers to the transition to cleaner energy alternatives are relatively low coal prices coupled with its level of supply security. Health benefits, however, are generally higher than the abatement costs in the most polluted areas, and support from governments for cleaner energy, that includes a focus on health, can be feasible and effective if carefully designed and targeted.",Volume 40,October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/40/suppl/C,9
"As the backbone of urban public transportation, subways are also major consumers of energy. More than 30% of the total energy is used to operate the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) subsystems. If it were possible to reduce energy consumption of HVAC subsystems a few percent, a significant quantity of electricity would be saved. From 2012 to 2013, we conducted field studies and developed autonomous control system for saving energy of HVAC systems in Beijing subway stations. The energy consumption features and the load signatures of the HVAC systems were investigated and we deployed comprehensive environment monitoring, passenger flow monitoring and run-time data logging subsystems to monitor and investigate the above features in several metro stations. The extracted features showed a broad space for optimizing current HVAC systems' operation to save energy. Based on the insights learned from the field studies, we spent four months to develop and deploy autonomous HVAC control systems in three metro stations. Up to now, the developed autonomous control systems have worked well and the energy logs showed that the autonomous control system helped the metro stations reduce energy in a range from 20% to 38% than the conventional control strategy.

"Passive cooling systems such as wind towers or wind catchers can create thermal comfort for building residents in hot and dry regions. This paper introduces an experimental study of a modular design of wind tower called the modular wind tower with wetted surfaces. Air temperature, relative humidity (RH) and airflow velocity parameters were measured at different times and at points when the velocity of the ambient air was zero. The results show that the modular wind tower can decrease the air temperature by an average of 10 °C and increase the relative humidity of airflow in a building by approximately 36% on average. Additionally, the wind tower can create the airflow velocity entering the building up to around 1.8 m/s. Furthermore, the obtained data from the measurements illustrate that the conditions of indoor air improve to the thermal comfort conditions.",Volume 39,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/39/suppl/C,10
"The development of sustainable energy systems is now firmly on the international agenda. Nations and their governments must strive to implement energy policies that facilitate sustainable development for society. Although Iceland is highly ranked by currently available energy indices, controversy has surrounded the development of previously undeveloped areas for power development and Iceland now finds itself at a crossroads regarding future energy developments. Well-designed indices for measuring the sustainability of energy systems can help policy-makers make the best choices for their national circumstances. However, often indicators and indices suffer from limitations and it may not be advisable to implement indicators designed for global comparisons at local, regional or even national scales. Nonetheless, indices such as those developed by the World Economic Council (WEC), World Economic Forum (WEF) for ranking countries and indicator sets such as the International Atomic Energy Agency's Energy (IAEA) Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development (EISD) may still be useful guides to decision-makers when designing their own national measurement tools provided the indicators fulfil certain criteria. Through interviews with key energy practitioners and decision-makers in energy development in Iceland and an extensive literature review, we identify the challenges faced in sustainable energy development in Iceland. We assess the suitability of indices proposed by organisations like the WEC, WEF and IAEA for reliably measuring the sustainability of energy development in individual countries like Iceland. We find that the indices and indicators evaluated suffer from commonly cited limitations including lack of methodological transparency, misalignment with sustainable development principles, inappropriate metrics, lack of clear targets, failure to capture socio-ecological impacts at different scales and failure to meet the interest of the target audience. Hence, they do not facilitate effective measurement of progress towards sustainable energy development for individual nations. Important issues relating to energy affordability and equity, environmental sustainability, efficiency, energy security and renewables are neglected by the indicators in all cases, although it should be said that the IAEA indicators are more comprehensive in their coverage of energy efficiency, renewables and environmental sustainability. In each case the indicators are at best only partially relevant to the Icelandic case, due to the country's unique energy mix, environment, economic structure and size and standard of living. By identifying their limitations and by examining them in light of criteria for good indicators as recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), we contribute to the discussion on the value and validity of indicators, indices and frameworks. Knowing the potential pitfalls, we are in a better position to design a more effective measurement tool. We conclude that a more comprehensive, multi-level, context-specific measurement tool would be needed for measuring national energy sustainability in Iceland and would require methods that allow broad public participation.",Volume 39,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/39/suppl/C,10
"This study placed improving quality of life at the centre of India’s national climate policy and asked what happens to greenhouse gas emissions with such an approach. In the lead up to the Paris climate agreement in 2015, countries determined their contributions based on their priorities, contexts, and capabilities and prepared their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. Following the agreement, these became each country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Using bottom-up scenario analyses, the sectoral interventions modelled in this research demonstrate that it is possible to get close to achieving the country’s NDC targets while improving quality of life at the same time. A comparison of a Business-As-Usual (BAU) and a sustainable development (SD) pathway leading up to 2030 reveals that improvements in a range of sustainable development conditions are possible. These include reduction in air pollution, savings in water and land use, and savings in materials and resource requirements. These changes occur along with a nearly 30% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and a 25% reduction in primary energy compared with BAU. Emissions intensity in 2030 is reduced in the sustainable development pathway by 16% compared with that in 2012 and fossil-free sources are able to contribute to about a third of India’s electricity.",Volume 39,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/39/suppl/C,10
"The poultry industry is a progressive and prospective agro-based sector in Bangladesh. Poultry droppings (PD) make an excellent and abundant raw material for anaerobic co-digestion (AD) because of its high nitrogen content. Two sets of comparative assays were conducted on the anaerobic co-digestion of PD with two lignocellulosic co-substrates (LCSs), namely wheat straw (WS) and meadow grass (MG), under five different mixing ratios to optimize substrate composition and C:N ratio for enhanced biogas production. All digesters were run simultaneously under a mesophilic temperature of 35 ± 1 °C with an identical volatile solids (VS) concentration. The results showed that the co-digestion of PD with LCSs was significantly higher in terms of biogas yield and bio-methane potential (BMP) than those obtained by mono-digestion of PD and LCSs. Co-digestion of PD and MG produced a higher cumulative biogas production, biogas yield and BMP than from respectively PD and WS. The highest methane contents found were 330.1 and 340.1 Nl kg− 1 VS after digestion for 90 days at a mixing ratio of, respectively, 70:30 (PD:WS) with a C:N ratio of 32.02 and a mixing ratio of 50:50 (PD:MG) with a C:N ratio of 31.52. The increases were 1.14 and 1.13 times those of the LCSs alone, respectively. Predicted optimum ratio for PD:LCSs and C:N ratios, maximum BMP and percentage volatile solids destruction (PVSD) were calculated by using software MINITAB-17 according to the best fit regression models for co-digestion of PD with LCSs.",Volume 39,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/39/suppl/C,10
"The impact of dome shaped roofs of various buildings on thermal comfort has been investigated by many researchers across the world. However, thus far, the advantage (or disadvantage) of multiple-domed roofs, which are most common in ancient bazaars of Iran, has not been evaluated. The subject of this article is to study the effect of shadows of multi-domed roofs on the receiving solar radiation on their surface temperature variation during a summer day. For studying, a numerical program for 3D geometry and quasi-steady state heat transfer is developed. The code is used to calculate and compare receiving solar radiation and temperature distribution on the dome roof as well as for flat roof in a hot summer day. Besides, effect of domes' orientation (north-south & east-west) and the ratio of height to radius of dome on the shadow area are determined during the day time. To validate the code, temperature distribution on the roof of numerical solution is compared with thermo-graphical pictures taken experimentally from Kerman's historical bazaar (for the same condition). The results show that despite the positive effect of using multiple-domed roofs on producing shadows, total heat transfer from roof is more in comparison with flat roofs. However, most part of the transferred heat is able to be convected out through the top opening of the dome.",Volume 39,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/39/suppl/C,10
"A dome-covered house can be considered as a sustainable building design example. It mimicks the optimal forms in the nature, and can help achieve reduction on the house heating energy need in cold winter. When the dome is made of electrochromic glazing, it can prevent large amount of solar energy from passing into the interior of the dome to prevent over-heating in summer. In this paper, a three-dimensional solar energy, thermal and air flow model is presented. The impact of different glazing types on the thermal environment inside the dome in summer and house heating load in winter is investigated. The use of electrochromic/low transmissivity glazing can result in the reduction of the absorption of solar radiation by the ground for up to 88.9%, as compared to the normal glazing and help to reduce the highest air temperature inside the dome from 41.8 °C to as low as 25.6 °C at 1:00 PM on July 21st in Montreal at 45°N latitude, southern part of Canada, and from 34.6 °C to 20.6 °C in Yellowknife at 62.5°N latitude, northern part of Canada, under different control strategies, thus can create a comfortable thermal environment inside the dome.",Volume 39,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/39/suppl/C,10
"Long-term credibility is a central pillar of climate policy. This paper assesses whether Ecuador's recently adopted climate targets, policies to decarbonize the power sector, and measures to reduce deforestation constitute a credible basis for a transformation towards a low-carbon economy. Based on the literature on the design of credible climate policy and expert interviews, we argue that even though Ecuador's existing policies may reduce emissions in the short term, they do not yet constitute an entry point for a long-term strategy of economic transformation. We then outline politically and institutionally feasible mitigation measures, which we evaluate from a dynamic policy sequencing perspective according to their potential to prepare the ground for more stringent measures to reduce emission in the future. These measures include inter alia reform of driving restrictions, public transport, vehicle efficiency standards, support for electric cars, and results-based payments to reduce land use emission. Such reforms will need to be phased in gradually and embedded in a broad fiscal reform package. To counter potential adverse distributional effects of higher energy prices, low-income groups could be protected by lowering other taxes, scaling up investment in education, and block-pricing schemes. Furthermore, increased participation of key stakeholders would likely reduce public opposition against energy- and climate-related policies, such as fossil fuel subsidy reform.",Volume 39,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/39/suppl/C,10
"This paper tracks the energy use and changes to China's energy-efficiency regulatory framework governing the iron and steel industry for the last thirty years. The detailed institutional analysis identifies both abating and augmenting effects of the regulatory framework changes on the energy intensity changes. The paper then assesses the impacts of various other factors on the energy intensity of China's iron and steel industry by using time-series data on the sector level. The quantitative analysis shows that technology progress, specifically the production process transition from high-energy intensive open-hearth furnace (OHF) to more energy efficient basic-oxygen furnace (BOF), is the biggest contributor to energy intensity reductions in China's iron and steel industry in the last thirty years, even after controlling for regulatory change and policy incentives. The ownership reform resulting from changes in the regulatory framework change contributed to energy intensity reductions in China's iron and steel industry, while fast market expansion resulting from market liberalization and regulation decentralization served as a principal barrier for energy efficiency improvements. Government policies, represented by financial subsidies from governments, correspond with energy intensity reductions in key large and medium sized enterprises, but interestingly, seem to be ineffective at producing energy intensity reductions for the industry as a whole. As other research indicated, rising coal prices also contributed to energy intensity reductions in China's iron and steel industry. Finally, the paper concludes that, to further incentivize energy intensity reductions, the Chinese government should consider correcting the negative impacts of the regulatory framework change, as well as transferring production processes to the highly energy efficient electric-arc furnace (EAF) and extending policy regulations to wider enterprise groups.",Volume 39,August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/39/suppl/C,10
"Debate continues around appropriate metrics to measure energy access for the poor. Whilst the underlying principles of energy access, for example affordability or safety, may be universal, the ways in which we define or measure these may vary across different regions. Much of the literature on metrics focuses on standardisation of measures that can have universal applicability. Whilst important for the international community, there is also a need to develop metrics that reflect contextual specificities to be useful to in-country stakeholders. This study has sought to develop a multi-dimensional framework of indicators, with the focus on how to operationalise these in contextually distinct ways that respond to local issues. A framework is developed representing four key dimensions: fuel use, affordability, safety and reliability. The paper offers methodological insights into the development of each and they are developed for the South African context. This illustrates the ways in which a particular context influences both how an indicator is conceptualised, as well as the choice of methods to operationalise it. Indicators aim to be responsive to, and informed by, localised factors such as the particular energy user and supply contexts, the policy environment and data availability.",Volume 38,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/38/suppl/C,11
"This study was carried out in four districts of Assam to assess the technical functionality of the solar home lighting systems (SHLS), service delivery model, institutional mechanism, maintenance and monitoring, user's awareness and its impacts on rural livelihood. The study found that only 28.9% of the systems are functional, 62.3% are found working with minor faults and 8.8% are either non-functional or having major faults. The average working durations per day for winter, summer and monsoon seasons are 2.2 h, 3.5 h and 2.3 h respectively. The study observes noticeable benefits due to adoption of SHLS such as reduction in kerosene consumption, increase in children's study hours, extended working hours of small businesses and income generation through mobile phone charging. One of the key reasons for unsatisfactory technical performance of SHLS is because of poor service delivery model and inefficiency in existing institutional structure such as passive village energy committee and non-availability of service centres or local technicians for post-installation maintenance. The study observes that user perceptions on the system are positive. However, cost considerations seem to be the main obstacle for system adoption. This study concludes that availability of local technicians, effective village energy committees, demand driven system design and appropriate social awareness towards livelihood improvement options will improve the sustainability and economic viability of the SHLS.",Volume 38,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/38/suppl/C,11
"Myanmar's rural population has very low access to electricity, mainly due to low disposal income and the remoteness of communities. This paper attempts to test the potential applicability of Grameen Shakti-Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL), which is a Bangladeshi public private partnership microfinance model, to rural Myanmar towards enhanced solar home systems (SHS) deployment. Rural poor are enabled by this microfinancing scheme to own SHSs in a few years for as low as US$6.40 per month. The objectives of this paper are to assess the experience of Grameen Shakti-IDCOL and other similar projects for invaluable lessons, identify barriers to sustainable electrification for Myanmar's rural poor and to apply these lessons learned to overcome barriers by developing policy recommendations for sustainable electrification for rural poor in Myanmar. Recommendations are provided suggesting the revision of some assumptions in the National Electrification Plan (NEP) and the creation of a microfinance-based public private partnership, with a polycentric structure, strong local presence and effective after sales service, to increase the deployment of SHSs to sustainably and economically supply modern energy to Myanmar's rural poor.",Volume 38,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/38/suppl/C,11
"Subjective satisfaction is a central element of technology adoption, but scholars have not analyzed the determinants of households' satisfaction with their cooking arrangements. Drawing on an original survey of 8568 households across six Indian states, we uncover the predictors of such satisfaction. Households do not find firewood collection inconvenient, but they are dissatisfied if they have to travel long distance to purchase firewood. Among sub-components of subjective satisfaction, reduction in smoke, speed of cooking, and quality of meals dominate over others (difficulty, cost, and safety). Moreover, we identify access to LPG – a modern cooking fuel – as a strong and robust predictor of high subjective satisfaction, mostly through reduction in smoke and increase in speed of cooking. Rural households ascribe a lot of value to access modern cooking fuels that reduce indoor air pollution, and beneficiaries of interventions to improve such access would value it. Thus, efforts to reduce reliance on cooking with traditional biomass are not just paternalistic top-down interventions but contribute to significantly improve households' satisfaction with their cooking arrangements.",Volume 38,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/38/suppl/C,11
"Traditionally, buildings in the Inner Himalayan valleys of Bhutan were constructed from rammed earth in the western regions and quarry stone in the central and eastern regions. Whilst basic architectural design elements have been retained, the construction methods have however changed over recent decades alongside expectations for indoor thermal comfort. Nevertheless, despite the need for space heating, thermal building performance remains largely unknown. Furthermore, no dedicated climate data is available for building performance assessments. This paper establishes such climatological information for the capital Thimphu and presents an investigation of building physics properties of traditional and contemporary building types. In a one month field study 10 buildings were surveyed, looking at building air tightness, indoor climate, wall U-values and water absorption of typical wall construction materials. The findings highlight comparably high wall U-values of 1.0 to 1.5 W/m²K for both current and historic constructions. Furthermore, air tightness tests show that, due to poorly sealed joints between construction elements, windows and doors, many buildings have high infiltration rates, reaching up to 5 air changes per hour. However, the results also indicate an indoor climate moderating effect of more traditional earth construction techniques. Based on these survey findings basic improvements are being suggested.",Volume 38,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/38/suppl/C,11
"Electrical utilities need to plan their investments in substations and networks to meet future customer demand, by predicting the spatial load growth and its time trend. Several techniques are currently in use to do that, such as trending analysis or simulation methods. To study the electricity demand we used multifractal analysis. A fractal is an object whose irregularities are not smooth and have some self-similarity at different scales. If the fractal does not have strict self-similarity, we could break such fractality, if it really exists in the system, in a spectrum of sub fractals which have a self-similar structure, performing the so-called multifractal spectral analysis. Multifractal spectral analysis has been already applied to study the morphology and population growth of cities. Because electricity demand can be related to demographics of cities, it is possible to consider the hypothesis that multifractal spectral decomposition can be applied to analyze electricity demand. A variety of multifractal analyses were performed on real data from the customer demand of an electrical utility. The results show that the analyzed electricity demand is split into clear and interesting two-multifractal distribution with properties not found yet in the literature on the subject. This type of multifractal analysis could lead the way to improved spatial demand forecasting methods.",Volume 38,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/38/suppl/C,11
"With political initiatives, such as the National Solar Mission by Government of India, rapid development of grid connected solar PV energy in India has occurred in the recent times. However, an interesting puzzle is with respect to significant regional differences in Indian states despite similar levels of solar radiation, government support and regional level policy and regulatory initiatives in the states. The paper discusses the implementation of grid-connected solar PV energy in two Indian states – Gujarat and West Bengal – under the national-level program Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission by the government of India. The paper offers empirical insights into implementation barriers involved in regional sustainable energy initiatives by using insights from the institutional entrepreneurship literature. The study concludes by describing the reasons for successful implementation in Gujarat and less successful implementation in West Bengal by discussing regional similarities and differences of institutional entrepreneurship of three key actors: government officials within regional government, regional regulatory agencies and regional industry associations.",Volume 38,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/38/suppl/C,11
"Two different, commercially available photovoltaic modules, monocrystalline and polycrystalline, have been monitored outdoors in the semi-arid area of Iran, over a complete year.The values of power output, specific energy yield, normalized power output, efficiency and performance ratio of each module have been analyzed and linked to the climatic characteristics of the site.The result indicates that despite the similar behavior of both PV modules with instantaneous irradiance, the monthly behavior of the modules is different, which is due to different light absorbing and thermal characteristics of each panel. The monthly average module efficiency of monocrystalline module has a gradual decreasing trend in the months with a higher ambient temperature, while polycrystalline module shows an inverse behavior. The results of monthly performance ratio have also shown that the performance of monocrystalline module decreases with increasing monthly ambient temperature.Monitoring the gross performance of both PV modules shows that the monocrystalline module performed better both regarding maximum efficiency and overall specific energy yield, and was found to be more efficient at this site. This work offers are also useful as a comparison for investigating the productivity of solar plants in different areas with climatic characteristics similar to the semi-arid region of Iran.",Volume 38,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/38/suppl/C,11
"The design, structure, and evaluation of an indirect solar tunnel dryer are presented. This dryer corresponds to the air forced convection type. Two similar solar dryers were built and tested with vegetables on an industrial scale in Huacalera, northern Argentina, and operated by a cooperative of small agricultural producers. Each dryer consisted of a tunnel chamber of 450 kg load capacity and a bank of 10 solar collectors of 92 m2. The bank of large solar collectors allowed temperatures in the drying chamber above 50 °C for 6 h a day, mixing with ambient air to produce the correct temperature for drying vegetables. A maximum rank of outlet temperatures of 80–90 °C and temperature differences of 50–60 °C were obtained with minimum air flow of 0.06 kg/s and without load. The dryers were operated with different vegetables, obtaining e.g. dried slicing onion with final moisture content 0.09 in approximately 16 h of sun. The optimum point of the collector efficiency was determined with airflow of 0.4 kg/s, however, lower than 0.23 kg/s airflow is needed to obtain outlet temperatures above 50 °C. A financial evaluation of the dryer was also performed as a clean energy project, reflecting that the investment return rate of the device is 13 months. In this scenario NPV improves in a 438% compared with the conventional scenario and SNPV is suitable only in the case of solar dryer. Solar drying at semi-industrial scale is feasible with the proposed technology due to the gusts of wind and the day-night thermal amplitude of Huacalera.",Volume 37,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/37/suppl/C,12

"Solar photovoltaic (PV) products are touted as a leading solution to long-term electrification and development problems in rural parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Yet there is little available data on the interactions between solar products and other household energy sources (which solar PVs are often assumed to simply displace) or the extent to which actual use patterns match up with the uses presumed by manufacturers and development agencies. This paper probes those questions through a survey that tracked approximately 500 early adopters of solar home systems in two off-grid markets in Africa. We find that these products were associated with large reductions in the use of kerosene and the charging of mobile phones outside the home. To a lesser extent, the use of small disposable batteries also decreased. However, solar home systems were, for the most part, not used to power radios, TVs, or flashlights. We also did not observe adopter households using these solar products to support income-generating activities.",Volume 37,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/37/suppl/C,12
"The Indian government is currently promoting and subsidising the replacement of solid cooking fuels with cleaner-burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). India is however a growing importer of LPG, the cost of which strongly linked to the prevailing oil price, which makes this program vulnerable to oil price shocks. Dimethyl ether (DME) is a synthetic fuel which may be blended with LPG and, if produced from domestic Indian feedstocks, one way of potentially reducing this vulnerability. A techno-economic analysis of the use of low grade Indian coal for this purpose is described in this paper, and the coal rich state of Jharkhand, where more than 18% of households used coal as a cooking fuel in 2011, was chosen as a study area. Here it was found that, due to higher cooking energy efficiency, the production and use of the DME (together with an associated electricity export) could result in 35% less coal being consumed when compared with a scenario where coal is used for cooking and to generate an equivalent amount of electricity. This analysis further shows that producing DME through this means would likely require oil prices in excess of $72 per barrel to be cost competitive with imported LPG.",Volume 37,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/37/suppl/C,12
"Banana crop produces large quantities of post-harvest biomass wastes. Some of them are a potential resource of raw materials such as natural fibers, which can be used as reinforcement for composite materials. The recovery of fibers, after bioconversion of the more digestible soft tissues to biogas was assessed for peduncles of three banana varieties (Grande Naine (GN), Pelipita (PPT) and CRBP969). Fibers were sieved out from the digestate. Biogas was monitored manometrically and with gas chromatography. PPT peduncle produced both the highest fibers recovery (0.2 g_DM_fiber/g_DM_initial_substrate) and methane production (260 ml_CH4/g_COD_initial_substrate) after 74 days of anaerobic digestion. This variety was the most suitable candidate to combine both fiber recovery and biomethane production through anaerobic digestion. GN peduncle fibers degraded in less than 20 days. This variety was more convenient for biomethane production (around 210 ml_CH4/g_COD_initial_substrate). The amount and the quality of recovered fibers strongly depended both on the duration of anaerobic digestion and the banana variety. This work showed that anaerobic digestion was an effective bioprocess alternative to mechanical decortication and biological retting processes for fiber extraction from banana peduncles biomass.",Volume 37,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/37/suppl/C,12
"This paper proposes a methodology devoted to finding and selecting more accurate conditions for sustainable hydrogen production via autothermal reforming of bioethanol. This methodology implies entire hydrogen production process design and simulation, energetic, exergetic and environmental life cycle assessment analysis studies and parametric (intuitive and design of experiment based methods) investigations.A base-case process operating under conditions recommended by simple investigation of chemical reactions was thoroughly studied. The results show that this base case process suffers from low performance. This is because the energetic, exergetic and environmental performances are comparatively lower than similar findings previously reported by other researchers for other reformates. The parametric investigation indicates that the process performances could be ensured by a proper and rational combination of the reactor temperature and the steam-to-carbon ratio. A key outcome of this research lies in establishing of second order mathematical models. These models can rapidly estimate the process performances (energetic, exergetic and environmental) based on temperature and the steam-to-carbon ratio.This paper recommends a reforming a temperature of 800 °C and a steam-to-carbon ratio of 4 as the accurate conditions for autothermal reforming of bioethanol. Such conditions ensure not only the lowest consumption of energy to generate a given amount of hydrogen but also the best environmental performance of the entire system.",Volume 37,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/37/suppl/C,12

"Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are used for converting heat into electricity. One of the challenges behind TEG is that the power generated is unstable and therefore needs proper power conditioning mechanism before it is supplied to the load. Moreover, it is necessary to track the maximum power point (MPP) so that maximum power is always extracted from TEG devices. The objective of this work is to analyse the performance of dc-dc converter with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) enabled by incremental conductance (IC) method. The results of the IC based MPPT approach have been compared with those of perturb and observe (P&O) based MPPT from a previous researcher. The results indicate that the IC based MPPT approach is able to track the MPP but with relatively lower efficiencies than the P&O based MPPT method. The matching efficiency within a temperature range of 200 °C–300 °C is in the range of 99.92%–99.95% for P&O and 99.46%–99.97% for IC method. However IC based MPPT method has higher voltage gain and converter efficiency than the P&O based MPPT method. Therefore, dc-dc converters are able to improve the steady state performance of TEG system as well as boosting the voltage to the desired level, hence improving the overall performance of TEG system.",Volume 37,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/37/suppl/C,12
"The energy sector is one of the largest sources of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in Mexico and the World due to the intensive use of fossil fuels. This article is developed on and examines from an environmental and economical approach an alternative scenario towards a Mexican Low Carbon Electric Power System, by analyzing 36 GHG mitigation options on the electric demand side, namely − 23 for an energy-efficient use and 4 for distributed generation, across the residential, commercial, public, industrial and energy sectors and, 9 options of electric power generation with Renewable Energy Sources (RES) on the electric power supply side. Our results reveal that, regarding the GHG baseline, towards 2020, this alternative scenario minimizes 33% of the GHG emissions, and towards 2035 these emissions are dramatically minimized at 79%. Furthermore, results also show that there is a possibility to reach a GHG peak in the electric power industry in very few years with this alternative scenario. Moreover, it is found that this alternative scenario will entail no cost in the analyzed period; on the contrary, it creates a global economic benefit of over 8000 MUSD, where 74% is related to the application of the mitigation options in the electric demand sectors and the remaining 26% comes from RES technologies in the electric power supply. Results show that the implementation of this alternative scenario requires an incremental investment of almost than 2 Billion USD/year within the analysis period. Lastly, it is shown that national goals for the electric power sector that have been recently established in the General Climate Change Law, the Energy Transition Law as well as the proposed Intended Nationally Determined Contribution in the Paris COP21 Agreements are feasible for achievement in this alternative scenario.",Volume 37,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/37/suppl/C,12
"Romania has increased its production of electricity from renewable sources by relying on projects situated in rural areas. This paper explores the impact of renewable energy projects on rural development in north-western Romania. The critical review of the literature has revealed that most studies stress the positive effects renewable energy projects can have on employment, demographics, revenues to the local budgets, and agriculture in the host communities.We observed, however, that none of those studies had a quantitative approach and they do not study in a comparative manner these effects. This paper takes a step further and compares the evolution of the four variables for villages with and without implemented renewable energy projects.

"The study analyses dis-adoption of biogas technologies in Central Uganda. Biogas technology makes use of livestock waste, crop material and food waste to produce a flammable gas that can be used for cooking and lighting. Use of biogas technology has multiple benefits for the households since it reduces the need for fuelwood for cooking and also produces bio-slurry which is a valuable fertilizer. Despite efforts by Government and Non-Governmental Organizations to promote the biogas technology, the rate of its adoption of biogas technology was found to be low, estimated at 25.8% of its potential. A review of literature showed that the households that dis-adopted biogas technology, did so within a period of 4 years after its installation, yet the lifespan of using it is estimated at 25 years. There was need to examine the factors contributing to dis-adoption. Using cross sectional data collected from Luwero and Mpigi districts found in Central Uganda, a probit model was estimated. The findings showed that an increase in the family size, the number of cattle, number of pigs and the age of the household head reduced the likelihood of biogas technology dis-adoption. Other factors that contributed to dis-adoption included the failure to sustain cattle and pig production that are necessary for feedstock supply, reduced availability of family labor the and inability of the households to repair biogas digesters after malfunctioning. Based on the findings, it was concluded that long term use of biogas technology required improved management practices on the farm so as to sustain livestock production. It is also recommended that quality standards and socio-cultural factors be considered in the design of biogas digesters and end use devices.",Volume 37,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/37/suppl/C,12

A customizable open-source PV racking concept is designed, prototyped for three types of modules, constructed into systems, and outdoor tested under extreme conditions for one year. An economic analysis is provided along with a technical evaluation of the system, which found the proposed racking system can be successfully printed with RepRap 3-D printers and saves between 85% and 92% from commercially available alternatives depending on the plastic used for printing. In addition, the plastic parts proved able to withstand some of the harshest outdoor conditions and due to the free and open-source nature of the designs, it allows the system to be adapted to custom applications in any region in the world more easily than any commercial alternatives.

"Borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) is found to be a favorable method for storing a large amount of thermal energy, and suitable for seasonal solar thermal storage, especially for large communities. Drake Landing Solar Community (DLSC), built in 2006, is the first such solar community in Canada. DLSC has achieved a 97% solar fraction after five years of operation. Although the DLSC project has been a success technically, the cost of the system is not attractive. In this study, an alternative design approach for a similar community is presented. The primary goal is to develop a system that not only achieves similar or better performance but also costs less. TRNSYS 17, along with a novel custom BTES component, is used for the system design and simulation. With the alternative design, the annual community thermal load of 2350 GJ is mostly met by solar thermal collectors via BTES and after five years of operation a 96% solar fraction is predicted. The simulation results are compared with published results for DLSC. It is estimated that the proposed system offers a 19% saving in initial cost in addition to reductions of BTES area of 38% and solar panel area of 25%.",Volume 36,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/36/suppl/C,13
"For the past many years Pakistan is facing electricity shortfall. The gap between demand and supply of electricity is as much as 6000 MW during the peak summer months. This has resulted into scheduled power cuts that range between 6–12 h in a day. To reduce the effect of these power cuts or load shedding, consumers have installed alternate energy sources such as Fossil Fuel Generators and Uninterpretable Power Supply Systems (UPSs). While Fossil Fuel Generators use energy sources such as oil and natural gas, the UPSs are charged from the electricity grid that is already under stress. Some sources estimate the UPSs penetration to as much as 40% in Pakistan. With this penetration rate the UPSs are a solution for individual consumers but it exacerbates the problem at the National scale. Moreover, the low quality of UPSs further strains the electricity system. In this paper presents a study to investigate the effects of UPSs in Pakistan's electricity system. By carrying out measurements of sample UPSs we estimated the amount of electricity the UPSs consume in Pakistan's electricity market. Our results show that depending on the number of power cut hours, the UPSs consume between 2%–7% of electricity at any given time. We further provide ways and measures to reduce the UPS charging load on the overall electricity system.",Volume 36,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/36/suppl/C,13
"Growing urban populations in Sub-Saharan Africa are increasing demand for charcoal. This paper presents a detailed case study of three communities supplying charcoal to Zomba, a medium-sized city in Southern Malawi. Using the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to structure our analysis, we examine individuals' motivations for producing charcoal, assess the seasonality of charcoal production, how livelihood outcomes vary between men and women, and identify sources of vulnerability for charcoal producer livelihoods. Drawing on data from four focus group exercises in each community and a total of 42 semi-structured interviews, we identify direct (e.g. financial) and indirect (e.g. strengthening of social networks, improved access to goods and services, opportunities for livelihood diversification) benefits that contribute to reducing producers' vulnerability to financial insecurity and improve their livelihoods. Irrespective of the benefits obtained and the actions (e.g. prioritising charcoal production over farming) of producers, participants did not perceive charcoal production as a desirable activity because the work was illegal, stigmatised hard and dangerous. Producers' primary motivations for engaging in production were to provide income to meet one-off purchases of expensive items, respond to an income shock, or to meet recurrent seasonal needs. Under certain conditions women were more dependent on income from charcoal production than men, as they had fewer alternative income generating options available to them. There was no reported management of charcoal resources in the study area, therefore the environmental sustainability of charcoal production and its associated benefits are uncertain. Malawi's current de facto charcoal ban leads to enforcement activities that exacerbate livelihood risks and increase producers' vulnerability to income insecurity.",Volume 36,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/36/suppl/C,13
"The Global Network on Energy for Sustainable Development (GNESD) was an initiative launched at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development to support the agenda for increased access to clean energy, as a key contribution to sustainable development. In addition to understanding how the Network was established, how it sustained its relations and organised its activities across borders, we contribute to the debate on global networks by introducing the concept of ‘outcomes’, as a means to understand the extent to which, and how, the Network was able to influence change within the participating countries. We conclude from the analysis that although there are numerous observable and verifiable outcomes, these were achieved in a rather unsystematic manner especially during the early years, and in a more structured and targeted manner during the last 5 years of the Network. To a great extent this reflects the output-focus that was prevalent within UNEP, and other similar organisations, at the time the Network was established. It also reflects the well-known structural challenge faced by many epistemic communities, where the extent of their influence reflects the extent to which they are embedded within evolving power structures.

"Burgeoning demand for additional energy sources to supplement existing fossil fuel supplies has increased the requirement for efficient and cost-effective renewable energy. Wind energy is among the most prominent renewable sources and wind turbine technology has seen growth in recent years. Urban-sited wind turbines are a significant feature of this growth, with small-scale and roof-mounted turbines receiving attention in the literature. A detailed analysis of the performance of a commercial-scale wind turbine operating in an urban environment is critically important for furthering understanding of the viability of this technology in a non-traditional environment. This study provides a performance characterisation of an 850 kW-rated wind turbine situated on-campus at Dundalk Institute of Technology, Ireland, with measurements having been obtained over the course of one year. Characterisation of the wind conditions recorded at the wind turbine site has enabled development of a Weibull distribution model with shape and scale factors of 1.9151 and 6.9665 respectively. The power curve of the turbine in operation is presented for comparison with manufacturer specifications and utilised along with the wind speed data to calculate the wind turbine's annual energy output (AEO) for the year. Importantly, these findings can be used to assist with future wind energy developments in assessing the technical and economic viability using the approach outlined in this work.",Volume 36,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/36/suppl/C,13
"This study attempts to analyze the integrated effects of carbon pricing in Chinese coal-fired power industry in two studied cases: with and without induced technological progress. Then several CO2 abatement pathways with different levels of carbon pricing are synthetically assessed for Chinese coal-fired power industry by extending a hybrid energy-economic model. Two types of autonomous technological progress such as industrial technology upgrading and autonomous energy efficiency improvement have been exogenously set for all economic sectors. One type of induced technological progress such as direct carbon removals is assumed to be introduced in coal-fired power industry, and its market share is endogenously calculated. Especially, oxy-fuel CCS technology is considered as a potential commercialized option for direct carbon removals. Then with different levels of carbon price setting for the newly increased CO2 emissions from coal-fired power industry, energy-economic indicators such as electricity cost, generation efficiency, economic growth, and CO2 emissions are comparatively analyzed for the choice of CO2 abatement pathway. Simulated results reveal that the upward trend of CO2 emissions cannot be changed within midterm if without induced technological progress. However, if with induced technological progress when carbon pricing is high enough, CO2 emissions could stop the upward trend, and even become decreasing accompanied by certain macroeconomic losses. When oxy-fuel CCS technology is introduced by charging for the newly increased CO2 emissions at 100 RMB2002 Yuan/t CO2, the induced CO2 abatement pathway of Chinese coal-fired power industry could be regard as optimal.",Volume 36,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/36/suppl/C,13
"A lighting cone is a simple metal cone placed on the charcoal bed during ignition to increase draft. Many traditional charcoal-burning stoves are difficult to light due to poor draft through the fuel bed, so lighting cones are used as an inexpensive accessory to help with charcoal ignition. The goal of this work was to determine the validity of using a lighting cone to decrease the ignition time of traditional Haitian charcoal stoves, and evaluate its impact on stove emissions and fuel consumption during the typically inefficient and slow ignition phase. We found that the lighting cone successfully reduced ignition time by over 50%. Due to a more efficient, shorter ignition stage, charcoal consumption during ignition was reduced by over 40% and carbon monoxide was reduced by over 50%. This suggests that lighting cones are a viable and beneficial accessory for aiding ignition in shallow-bed charcoal stoves.",Volume 36,February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/36/suppl/C,13
"Measurement of the moisture content of biomass fuels is critical for the measurement of emission factors and accounting for differences in stove performance results from standardized tests such as the water boiling test. Moisture probe measurements have been used systematically for the assessment of moisture content of woody fuels, as it is more convenient than laboratory-based oven-drying methods because multiple measurements can be rapidly performed on-site as the fuel for the cooking task is selected for use. Current protocols, however, state that the probes used to measure moisture content in wood cannot be used with dung, crop residues, or other non-wood fuels. The averages from 5 replicate moisture probe measurements on each of 35 cow and buffalo dung patties from Haryana, India, were compared to oven drying moisture measurement at 103 ± 2 °C. Dung patties were selected ranging in moisture content from 5% to 65% on a dry basis based on probe measurements with 5 unique patties in each 10% increment. The results showed good linearity between moisture probe ≤ 55% and oven drying methods (r2 = 0.76). Results were then used to adjust uncontrolled measurements of dung moisture taken prior to cooking for 17 homes in 4 villages in rural Haryana, India, which demonstrate that the commonly used moisture probe, when calibrated against oven-based methods, can be used to assess moisture content of dung patties over the range of dung moisture typically found and used in villages for cooking purposes.",Volume 35,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/35/suppl/C,14
"The usage of passive cooling systems such as wind catchers can reduce the energy usage in buildings and provide natural ventilation and comfort to its occupants, particularly in hot and dry regions of Iran and neighboring countries where it was traditionally used. The purpose of this study was to investigate the airflow and thermal comfort in six different designs of wind catchers using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. Simulations of airflow in the wind catcher and the building were done under steady state and turbulent flow regime with boundary conditions based on typical conditions found in Yazd city, Iran. Several commonly used turbulence models were evaluated to assess the accuracy of the simulation. First, the proposed CFD model was validated through comparison of wind tunnel data available in the literature, and then the model was used for design purposes. It was found that the k − ω turbulence model can accurately predict the airflow velocity in the range of parameters studied. The design and performance of wind catcher were evaluated based on the thermal comfort levels using the Center for the Built Environment (CBE) thermal comfort tool and numerical data. Width and height of the wind catcher were varied in the simulations and optimal values were determined. It was found that varying the width of the wind catcher had the greatest impact on the airflow speed and distribution inside the room. Reducing the width from 2.5 m to 2 m showed that airflow velocity in the middle area was increased up to 34%. While reducing the width from 2 m to 1.5 m showed an entirely different flow pattern inside the building and also increase airflow speed in the middle area up to 50%. The addition of curved wall at the bottom of the inlet channel showed that it could increase the airflow speed of the inflow stream, however, it also caused the airflow to be directed towards the lower levels of the room and very large rotating flows in the upper levels. Finally, the results showed that the wind catcher may be optimized for improving comfort for various climates using the tools presented in this work.",Volume 35,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/35/suppl/C,14
"Although most studies of energy poverty focus on whether or not households have access to modern fuels, expenditure is also an important issue, as households in developing countries spend a significant proportion of their total expenditures on energy. Using nationally representative household data from India, 1987–2010, this article describes and explains trends in household energy expenditure. While monthly household spending on energy has increased in many Indian states, this change is not driven by increased household affluence. Statistical analysis shows that when modern fuels (LPG for cooking, electricity for lighting and appliances) are available, households are willing and able to spend on energy. Indian households that have seen improved access to LPG and electricity have also seen much higher energy expenditures, whereas increased household incomes do not explain greater spending on household energy. For policymakers, the key lesson is that programs to improve access to modern fuels allow both wealthy and poor households to spend money on valuable energy services.",Volume 35,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/35/suppl/C,14
"An unbiased assessment of cooking patterns during a cookstove intervention can provide strong evidence for sustained usage of a cookstove among the target population. A bioethanol cookstove was used as an intervention within a randomized controlled trial being conducted in Ibadan, Nigeria to assess the ability of a clean stove to improve birth outcomes. Sustained usage of the intervention was quantified using a newly developed method of analyzing cooking patterns based on time integrated temperature data from Stove Use Monitors (SUMs) installed on household cookstoves. The method accounts for household level variations in ambient temperatures. We report a significant decline of traditional kerosene stove usage, 84% of women in the Bioethanol arm giving away their kerosene stove before the conclusion of the study (56% within the first month of enrollment), suggesting the bioethanol stove replaced the kerosene stove. This is the first study to objectively evaluate a liquid-to-liquid fuel substitution.",Volume 35,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/35/suppl/C,14
"When developers are building wind farms offshore or onshore, are there notable characteristics that differentiate these projects? If so, what does this tell us about the nature of wind power development patterns? This study makes use of industry data from 44 wind farms, including 11 offshore wind farms, 19 onshore wind farms located in farmland and 14 wind farms located in forested areas with a total capacity of 1190 MW installed actual wind farms to test four hypotheses based on preconceptions identified in a literature review. Testing the validity of these preconceptions is important because if policymakers are to design policy to facilitate specific development patterns in a given nation, they need to be clear on what is working in the market. Our data suggest that, contrary to popular belief, offshore wind farms do not produce more energy per installed MW when compared to onshore wind farms. However, our data confirm that offshore wind farms produce more energy than onshore wind farms. We contend that this has less to do with superior wind quality in offshore sites than with scale differences. It appears that developers construct far larger offshore wind farms in order to presumably counteract the proportionally higher development costs associated with marine environments. One other remarkable finding associated with this study is that onshore wind turbines that are located in forested areas might be capable of matching the power production of offshore wind farms without incurring the additional costs associated with offshore projects.",Volume 35,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/35/suppl/C,14
"Renewable energy entrepreneurs in developing countries are selling and facilitating the uptake of a new technology and new ideas in an already difficult environment. We explore entrepreneurs' perceptions of the constraints they face while operating their businesses. We used two stages of analysis — primary data from individual entrepreneurs and country level secondary data. The primary data included in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs, as well as their self-ranking of constraints via a questionnaire. Findings emphasised the importance of government/regulatory and local market constraints. To contextualise these findings, we compared the individual-level findings to country-level conditions to assess whether they have any bearing on the entrepreneurs' perceptions of constraints. Country conditions may influence the entrepreneurs' perceptions of the demand for their products and/or services, and their opportunity and ability to supply these to customers. These may be influencing whether and how the entrepreneurs perceive and respond to opportunities to carry on with their renewable energy businesses.",Volume 35,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/35/suppl/C,14
"Bringing access to modern energy sources to the poorest in society is a key goal of many policymakers, businesses and charities, but in order to be a success projects and schemes must be founded on accurate data. We undertook a survey of energy demand and usage patterns in households in unelectrified villages in Uttar Pradesh, India to assess access to and utilisation of energy sources for lighting and cooking. The times of usage were recorded and analysed and the effect on usage patterns of transitioning from traditional to modern energy sources is assessed. We quantify the cost and greenhouse gas emissions of current energy use in order to provide a benchmark of potential mitigation through the use of renewable energy technologies: a typical household with kerosene lamps only for lighting spends INR 3243 (US$50.67) and emits 381 kgCO2eq per year; households with modern cooking energy spend 17% more through increased usage, but emit 28% less greenhouse gases compared to those with traditional stoves only. Cell phone ownership was found to be 50% amongst adults. We use demographic and utilisation data to construct an hourly demand profile of basic electricity demand extrapolated to each month of the year, and present an example of aspirational demand assess the impact of desirable appliances. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to highlight the daily and seasonal variation in total energy and power demand. A hybrid system, with solar power and battery storage meeting daytime demand and higher-capacity diesel- or biomass-powered generation meeting the remainder during evening peaks and winter months, would satisfy demand most effectively.",Volume 35,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/35/suppl/C,14
"Building sector in India consumes about 33% of total electrical energy use, out of which 25% is accounted by the residential sector. This can be effectively reduced by utilizing daylighting as an essential component of building design strategy. Indian building codes lack specific daylight-inclusive design guidelines, which can provide policy support in reducing the energy consumption. In this study, energy sustainability through daylighting is studied with respect to daylight performance of a middle income, residential apartment in the city of Mumbai. Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) is used as the performance metric. The effect of built components like window-to-wall ratio (WWR) and orientation on the UDI ranges was studied. Occupancy behavior was modelled using an UDI threshold of 500 lx, and an energy management matrix (EMM) was derived. It has been found that at south-east orientation and at 20% WWR, the base-case building would save up to 26% lighting energy. Finally, a methodological framework for developing a policy toolbox using EMM was proposed as a route towards designing daylight inclusive building bye-law.",Volume 34,October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/34/suppl/C,15
"The study presents baseline data on local rice parboiling process and its energy supply, use and impacts in three communities in the Northern region of Ghana. The process as practiced is rudimentary and time-consuming requiring several hours of soaking and wood collection. Parboiling energy is supplied solely from wood which accounts for 11.9% of the total rice processing cost. The average specific soaking energy per batch of 11 and 40 were estimated to be 16.5 and 8.4 MJ/kg, respectively while that of steaming were 18.3 and 10.3 MJ/kg, respectively. Energy consumption was mostly influenced by the amount of paddy processed and the steaming duration. These results imply that specific energy use in these communities are at least 7 times higher than the average parboiling energy reports in the literature and considerably reduces the income of parboilers. The use of improved stove, utilization of rice husk as an energy source and higher processing capacity are recommended interventions for reducing energy use and cost, mitigating the environmental and health impacts as well as improving rice productivity.",Volume 34,October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/34/suppl/C,15
"Micro-grids are actively employed for rural electrification along with integrated renewable energy systems in developing countries. For determining their optimal configurations, it is often challenging in obtaining accurate input data, particularly prospective electricity loads and local renewable resource availability. In this study, the configuration of the off-grid 120 kWp PV system in West Bengal, India is reassessed by using the optimization software, HOMER. With an assumption that excess biomass resources would be available as a result of successful introduction of fuel-saving devices such as solar cookers, a PV–biomass–battery system, which consists of 30 kW PV array and 20 kW biomass gasification-based power plant (BGPP), turns out to be the most economically feasible option. Compared with the actual system, the net present cost (NPC) and cost of electricity (COE) are significantly lowered. Furthermore, in order to verify effectiveness of “phased approach” for developing the off-grid renewable energy system, which has been proposed in the authors' previous study, the system expansion process is simulated by HOMER according to three different load growth scenarios. It is found from the simulation that adjustment of the system size becomes possible with more accurate load estimation at the time of expansion, which may lead to lower operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and COE. As a result of the increased level of tariff revenue from additional consumers, the expansion process would provide an opportunity for enhancing community welfare and financial viability of the project.",Volume 34,October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/34/suppl/C,15
"The proliferation of off-grid photovoltaic (PV) systems is rapidly increasing in the least developed countries. The sizing of system components—primarily PV panels and batteries—is critically influenced by the expected daily load. However, accurately estimating incipient electrical load of rural consumers is fraught with challenges. Load estimation error is propagated through the design phase, potentially resulting in a system that is unduly expensive or fails to meet reliability targets. This article investigates the effects of daily load estimation error on system design, cost and reliability. Load and insolation data from seven off-grid systems in Malawi were collected. The systems were redesigned using three different intuitive design approaches considering different levels of load estimation error, ranging from ± 90% of the actual measured load. The cost of each design is estimated from in-country prices. The reliability of each design is determined from an hourly simulation using the measured data. The results show that PV array and battery sizing scale proportionately with load estimation error and that the cost of load over-estimation is approximately US$1.92 to US$6.02 per watthour, whereas under-estimation can precipitously degrade reliability. A cost-versus-reliability analysis shows that for the Malawi systems, on average 46% of the PV and battery costs are used to improve the simulated hourly reliability from 99% to 100%. Moreover, the results point to the challenges with intuitive design approaches, showing that consideration of average load alone can lead to over- or under-designed systems.",Volume 34,October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/34/suppl/C,15
"Smallholder rubber producers typically dry rubber in the open air, a process that takes about seven days, allowing the rubber to deteriorate and thus decreasing the price obtained by the producers. Solar dryers decrease the drying time by 2–3 days, thereby yielding a higher quality product. In this study, performances of mixed-mode and indirect solar drying systems have been investigated for 30 natural rubber sheets. Drying efficiency of the mixed-mode dyer is 15.4% which is higher than the indirect solar dryer (13.3%). The moisture contents of rubber sheets are reduced from 32.3 to 2.0% and 29.4 to 8.0% on a wet basis for mixed-mode and indirect solar drying, respectively, in 4 days. Hii et al. model is the combination of the Page and Two-term drying model. This model is found to best describe the natural rubber sheet drying behavior in both mixed-mode and indirect solar dryers. Coefficient of determination and root mean square error for mixed-mode and indirect solar drying of natural rubber are 0.998 & 0.0096 and 0.996 & 0.0109, respectively. Performance of the mixed-mode dryer is superior to the indirect solar dryer. Therefore, mixed-mode solar dryers are recommended for natural rubber sheet drying to smallholders.",Volume 34,October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/34/suppl/C,15
"Many individuals in developing areas use biomass cookstoves for cooking although there are many inherent health hazards. Judging which improved cookstove to use and distinguishing the best one for a given cooking style to mitigate these hazards is challenging. Thermal efficiency (ηth) is one assessment parameter of cookstoves that is often used. To compare ηth between cookstoves or to assess the effects of a design change on ηth, it is important to understand how the uncertainty in ηth depends on measurements, input data (equipment uncertainties, literature values, etc.), and test conditions. In this work, measurement and input data uncertainties are quantified with a propagation of uncertainty analysis for a basic brick channel cookstove used in many Peruvian households. This method can be used in any study by using reasonable uncertainty values for that study. Results showed that the four main parameters contributing to 93% of the ηth uncertainty were the lower heating values (LHV) of wood and char, the moisture content, and the change in temperature of the water in the pot. Reducing the uncertainty of LHV of unprocessed fuels is the most difficult. If such fuels are used, reporting the LHV value and its associated uncertainty is highly valuable.",Volume 34,October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/34/suppl/C,15
"Bamboo plantations can help expanding biomass production to marginal lands, while requiring limited chemical and labour inputs. However, the development of a modern industrial bamboo energy chain requires an adequate level of mechanization. The study presents the preliminary test of a new single-pass cut-and-shred harvester, designed for application to a powerful farm tractor. The machine is especially suited to negotiating disorganized crops, which offer challenging conditions for the more efficient forager-based harvesters. The results show that productivity may exceed 6 fresh t h− 1, which is close to the assumed theoretical limit for this machine type. Fuel use is over 3 l fresh t− 1, while harvesting cost varies around 33 € t− 1. Fuel use and harvesting cost are still relatively high, but they are likely to decrease as operators gain experience with the new system, and as the system itself is further improved. In any case, cost reduction is only one of the benefits accrued by mechanization, which also plays a major role in improving worker safety and overall supply chain efficiency.",Volume 34,October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/34/suppl/C,15
"Biomass burning for home energy use is a major health and environmental concern. While transitioning to cleaner cooking technologies has the potential to generate significant health and environmental benefits, prior efforts to introduce improved cookstoves have encountered many hurdles. Here, we focus on the increased stove use hurdle; households tend to use improved stoves alongside their traditional stoves rather than replacing them entirely, a phenomenon called cookstove “stacking.” This work provides a systematic, multi-method assessment of households' cooking behaviors and cookstove stacking in the context of a 200-home randomized cookstove intervention study in Northern Ghana. Two stoves were selected for the intervention, a locally made rocket stove (Gyapa) and the Philips HD4012 LS gasifier stove. There were four intervention groups: a control group, a group given two Gyapa stoves, a group given two Philips stoves, and a group given one of each. Two stoves were distributed to each home in an attempt to induce more substitution away from traditional stoves. Adoption and usage patterns were quantified using temperature loggers at a subset of homes, as well as quarterly surveying in all households. We find that using multiple stoves each day is common practice within each intervention group, and that the two groups given at least one Gyapa had the largest reductions in traditional stove use relative to the control group, though use of traditional stoves remained high in all groups.",Volume 34,October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/34/suppl/C,15
"The relationship between energy consumption and national economic welfare, as measured by gross domestic product, has been evaluated statistically in numerous studies. We summarize and compare the results of several of these studies for 15 emerging economies. Considerable differences between studies and between nations are found. Then, we introduce two measures of welfare based on the “Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare” (ISEW). The first measure, “BISEW” (hereafter BISEW), modifies GDP to emphasize equality, capital stock, and spending on private consumption, education, and medical care. The second measure, “Solid ISEW” (hereafter SISEW), subtracts carbon dioxide emissions and various measures of resource depletion to the BISEW, thus combining economic and environmental considerations in the measure of welfare. We apply Granger causality analysis with a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) to evaluate how energy consumption correlates with GDP, BISEW, and SISEW for 15 emerging economies over the period 1995–2013. The results are expressed in terms of the directionality of Granger causality. Although there is consistency in many cases, the direction of causality is found to vary substantially between countries and depending on which of the three measures of welfare is evaluated.",Volume 34,October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/34/suppl/C,15
"Upstream petrochemical industry accounts for the highest energy consumption among all stages of petrochemical industry in Thailand. The energy conservation in this industry is essential for sustainable industrial development. In this research, the performance of energy conservation measures adopted in Thailand's upstream petrochemical industry are in-depth analyzed in energy, environmental, and economic cost effectiveness perspectives by using four indices: (1) reduction in energy intensity (EnRI), (2) reduction in carbon intensity (ERI), (3) energy consumption reduction on investment (EnROI), and (4) greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction on investment (EROI). Furthermore, the methods for evaluating the economic feasibility, and estimating the potential for energy saving and GHG emission reduction are proposed. The analyzed result suggests that the energy saving and greenhouse gas emission reduction potential are 5,267 GJ/million USD of product and 450 tCO2eq/million USD of product, and 5,272 GJ/million USD of product and 451 tCO2eq/million USD of product, in case of without and with carbon credit, respectively. The evaluation and assessment method proposed in this research can support decision makers to analyze and evaluate the economic feasibility of the measures under various policies and pricing scenarios of energy and carbon credit and, can be applied in other industries as well.",Volume 34,October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/34/suppl/C,15
"Wave power in China has an energy density that is one-tenth of that of the wave power in Europe. Therefore, Chinese developers cannot simply replicate and transplant European devices and facilities to East Asia. Instead, to exploit the conditions in East Asia, a combined-oscillating-buoy-based wave energy convertor (WEC) is proposed as an array-type WEC. Sea trials of a 10 kW pilot device confirmed the feasibility of its buoy array and hydraulic pressure system (HPS) for wave-energy conversion. Field test data indicated that the energy-converting efficiency of the direct-drive design was relatively low, suggesting the urgency of developing energy storage systems to the increase of power take-off productivity. A hydraulic accumulator system (HAS) was designed to replace the original direct-drive operating mechanism for a 100 kW final-prototype device. It was expected that the system will exhibit an improved ability to collect and store energy from smaller waves to enhance the total converting efficiency. Experimental studies were performed to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the heaving buoys under the damping effects, and the operating performance of the accumulator system. A numerical wave-to-wire model based on Simulink, Matlab was set-up to study the energy output of the HPS-HAS under the wave conditions of the test site. It was shown that four buoys could charge ten accumulators in half an hour under local actual sea conditions. Furthermore, in a same running time, the output energy of the HPS-HAS is over forty times larger than that of the HPS without any energy storage device. In addition, energy discharging from three accumulators only could reach about 20 kW output power. The numbers of buoys and accumulators should be optimized to improve wave-energy storage and power generation in the future.",Volume 34,October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/34/suppl/C,15
"While it is commonly believed that democracy influences public service provision, comparably few studies have assessed how recent democratisation in developing countries has impacted tangible public service outcomes for economically deprived population shares. Using panel data from 46 sub-Saharan African countries between 1990 and 2010 as well as qualitative country case examples from Ghana, Swaziland, Uganda, Senegal and Rwanda, this paper examines considerable and growing rural electrification variations in terms of political, economic and demographic variables. The analyses suggest that democracy is strongly associated with rural electrification increases and rural versus urban electrification inequality decreases in sub-Saharan Africa. This result is robust to a variety of political, economic and demographic control variables as well as different econometric modelling assumptions. The paper further presents novel multi-variant evidence supporting that contested elections with strong oppositions as well as effective policy implementing institutions may act as intervening institutional mechanisms that explain a part of democracy's association with rural electricity provision. Higher income per capita, national savings and population densities may further foster rural electrification, while high foreign aid shares of GDP and rural population percentages may pose challenges to access equality.",Volume 34,October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/34/suppl/C,15
"The present study dealt with hydrogen and methane production in a sequential up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at thermophilic temperature. The POME was used as a suitable substrate of carbon source. The effect of various OLR was investigated from 25 kg-COD/m3·d to 125 kg-COD/m3·d at a constant hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6 h. The UASB-H2 reactor was operated successfully at the OLR of 75 kg-COD/m3·d when the proportion of H2 in biogas, volumetric production rate of H2, specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR) and H2 yield reached the maximum values of 35%, 2.1 l/d, 175.15 ml H2/g MLVSS-d and 49.22 ml H2/g CODapplied respectively. Further, the effluent from the UASB was directly fed into the CSTR at various OLR ranging from 4 kg-COD/m3·d to 20 kg-COD/m3·d for CH4 production. The maximum CH4 content, volumetric production rate of CH4, specific methane production rate (SMPR) and CH4 yield obtained were 65%, 13 l/d, 325.13 ml CH4/g MLVSS-d, and 155.87 ml CH4/g CODapplied respectively.

"Through history, special attention has been paid to the study of the relationship between the energy use of a country and its level of development. While the interest of this research area is unquestionable, the energy indicators commonly used (e.g. total primary energy) are problematic. In the current context of globalization, the energy used by a country is not anymore a suitable indicator for measuring the total energy requirements associated with its level of development; the significant variable is the energy consumed worldwide to produce the goods and services demanded by that country, i.e. its energy footprint. In this study, we compare the human development index of 40 countries with their total primary energy demand and total primary energy footprint for the period 1995–2008. The results show that the total primary energy demand underestimates the energy required to maintain a high level of development, since a significant part of the energy used by emerging countries is being increasingly devoted to sustain the welfare of developed countries by means of international trade. We also find that the minimum total primary energy footprint per capita to achieve a high level of development is 33% higher than current world's per capita energy use.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"To mitigate the impact of excess pollution, deforestation, and injuries attributable to cookstoves in low and middle income countries, humanitarian and private sector organisations have made a commitment to increase the adoption of improved cookstoves (ICS) to 100 million households by 2020 . In order to evaluate the safety of these ICS for the end users, a ten-test “biomass stove safety protocol” (BSSP) has been developed by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (GACC). However, there is no published evidence that this protocol has been independently assessed or benchmarked. This study aimed to determine whether the BSSP is fit for purpose such that, it will produce repeatable safety ratings for a range of cookstoves when performed by different testers. Results indicated that the scores for each stove varied considerably between each of the six testers with only one of five ICS receiving the same overall safety rating. While individually some tests produced relatively coherent scores, others led to large discrepancies. We conclude that although BSSP is an important starting point in highlighting the need for stove safety assessment, there are some aspects of the protocol that require further development to ensure that it can be reliably replicated by different testers.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"Firewood is the major fuel for household heating in south-central Chile and combustion of wood is the major source of air pollution by particulate matter (PM) emissions in this region. This paper discusses various strategies for lowering emissions from household wood combustion and their effectiveness in reducing air contamination. A survey of 2025 households and previous analysis performed with these data showed large consumption of wood fuel for heating in dwellings in Valdivia. The main variable identified is the low thermal efficiency of household envelope. Low efficiency of household envelope, low comfort, and a large share of income dedicated to energy, determines a high level of energy poverty. We have modeled the thermal retrofitting of dwellings under three efficiency scenarios, including stoves’ and house’s envelope improvements. Retrofitting houses led to energy poverty alleviation; in contrast, improvement of heating appliances alone does not alleviate energy poverty nor improve indoor comfort.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"The spread of biofuels has generated controversy at international, national and regional levels due to the environmental, economic and social impacts that its production and consumption can cause. Recently, the Spanish government has been promoting the production of biodiesel in industrial plants located in Spain and other EU countries. These developments are expected to stimulate the cultivation of rapeseed in the EU to the detriment of extra-EU imports of biodiesel mainly based on soybean oil from Argentina, which has been one of the main suppliers of biodiesel in Spain for years. As a result, the environmental impacts produced throughout the life cycle of biodiesel consumed in Spain could be radically affected. In this context, the environmental impacts of biodiesel produced in Spain and Argentina with rapeseed cultivated in Spain and soybean cultivated in Argentina were compared under certain growing conditions using life cycle assessment (LCA). Consequential and attributional approaches were compared under the ReCiPe method to test potential biases. The results showed that the biodiesel produced with Argentinean soybean oil had fewer environmental impacts than biodiesel produced with Spanish rapeseed oil. Seed production (and fertilization) was the process (and sub-process) that generated the greatest environmental burdens, and it is an area in which improvement is necessary in order to increase sustainability, particularly with regard to Spanish rapeseed-based biodiesel.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"With fuelwood arguably being the most important product from local forests for rural people in developing regions, its scarcity is an issue of very real importance. One strategy to simultaneously alleviate pressures on forest resources and increase the sustainability of its use has been the promotion of improved cook stoves (ICS). While ICS have been promoted as a means to reduce indoor air pollution and improve health in rural areas, or to reduce demand for fuelwood as a means of halting forest degradation, there is a dearth of research that links the influences of ICS on preferences for firewood species. From a sustainable forest management perspective, this is an important area of inquiry. The purpose of this study was to illuminate the potential impacts of an ICS on firewood use and tree species preference in several Malawian study sites. From a sustainable forest management perspective, the results are intriguing. The introduction of an ICS – in this case, the Chitetzo mbaula earthen clay cookstove – in several villages in two southern Malawian districts/study sites appears to translate to a greater preference for slow-growing indigenous firewood species (e.g., Brachystegia spp.) over fast-growing exotic alternatives (e.g., Eucalyptus spp., Mangifera indica). A reasonable application of these results would be to assist rural people to plant a variety of firewood (and ideally multi-purpose) trees that offered a phased succession whereby faster-growing exotics would still be required and planted in the near term with a transition to slower-growing indigenous trees over the longer term.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16

"Aeroelastic flutter is a self-oscillating phenomenon resulting from interaction between a structure and the surrounding flow. This is well-known as a destructive phenomenon. However, it can also be used as a powerful mechanism to harvest wind energy at the scales and costs beyond the reach of turbines. Windbelt is a micro generator exploiting wind energy with small size and capacity, which was invented and developed a few years ago (Humdinger wind energy LLC, 2007) basing on aeroelastic flutter. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influences of the design parameters on the performance of a windbelt with the goal of maximizing its output power. An experimental apparatus is developed to study the effects of parameters such as wind speed, position and size of the magnets, pre-applied tension of the membrane, angle of attack of the membrane, and the direction of the generator on the output power and frequency of the windbelt. The experimental tests are carried out in a subsonic wind tunnel. After that, we deduce optimal parameters from experimental results to maximize the output power. Two micro generators are then fabricated and tested in both wind tunnel and real condition. The results show that a single micro generator (windbelt) can generate a power of from 3 to 5 mW and a windpanel of 5 single windbelts (larger ones) can generate a power of from 30 to 100 mW at the wind speed of less than 8 m/s. This output is sufficient to power many micro devices such as wireless sensors, electronic chips, LEDs, and cell phone chargers. Therefore, this micro wind energy generator may be widely used in practice.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16

The boundary of each site earmarked for charcoal production was mapped with a hand-held Global Positioning System, and the diameters at breast height (dbh) and the heights of trees of dbh ≥ 5 cm were measured, prior to harvest. The extent of harvested sites was compared with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change criterion of “devegetation” using Wilcoxon test, while the biomass carbon and basal area of the harvested trees were compared with those of the remnant trees using Mann Whitney t-test. The median of the extent of harvested sites (M = 0.23 ha, P = 1.00) was significantly higher than 0.05 ha, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change minimum criterion for “devegetation”, while the difference between median basal area of harvested and remnant trees was significantly greater than zero (Gh − Gr = 2.6 m2 ha−1; P = 0.001) at 95% significant level. The Mann Whitney test also provided sufficient evidence (n = 23; Mhc − Mrc = 12.07 t ha− 1; P < 0.001) against the null hypothesis that the difference between the medians of the aboveground biomass carbon in the harvested and remnant is zero at 95% significant level. On the basis of the IPCC definition of “devegetation” and the changes in basal area, it suggests that intensive charcoal production has the potential of degrading woodlands. Nonetheless, it is worth highlighting that, none of the harvested sites had zero basal area or biomass carbon after harvest, which is a significant revelation for sustainable woodland management for charcoal production. The study further revealed that the extent of harvested site is not an appropriate measure of the impact of charcoal production on woodland since it does not account for the number and sizes of the trees harvested. Therefore, the impact of charcoal production on woodland may not be as alarming as it is generally perceived when the extent of harvested site is used as a measure. The impact of charcoal production is often over-generalized and that, “devegetation” of harvested sites is an issue of post-harvest woodland management and not the impact of charcoal production per se. Therefore, the evidence of the impact of charcoal production on woodlands shown in this study should be basis for sustainable woodlands management and not basis for halting charcoal production in the study area.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"This paper presents an experimentally validated steady-state heat transfer model of a shielded-fire, natural-draft biomass cookstove suitable for conceptual design of the small household cookstoves used in developing countries. The input variables for the model included 10 geometrical design variables, 2 material design variables, and 3 operating conditions. This model was validated using data from three previously published studies including 63 distinct combinations of the 15 design variables. The model results for thermal efficiency are within ± 5% for 59 of the 63 designs and have an L2 norm error of 3.0%. Parametric variations of design variables can assist in the conceptual phase of design. In addition, the temperature and velocity profiles, location and magnitude of losses, and heat transfer contributions through various modes and regions of the pot provide sufficient detail to improve the understanding of a cookstove system and support detailed design.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"Energy consumption in Indian building sector is increasing at high rate. The National Building Code of India specifies a narrow comfort temperature range between 21 °C and 26 °C for all types of buildings and for all seasons. A thermal comfort field study was conducted in 32 naturally ventilated buildings, collecting a total of 2610 samples spread over a total period of four years, covering multiple seasons, age groups, clothing types and building types. Questionnaires were administered to building occupants to record sensations and preferences for air temperature, relative humidity and air velocity on ASHRAE seven point and five point scales. The objective of the study was to evaluate thermal comfort of occupants and study the methods of thermal adaptation such as adjusting clothing, window opening, and use of air circulation fans. Griffith's method was used to determine thermal neutrality. The comfort temperature for summer and winter season was found to be 30.6 °C and 25.2 °C, respectively. Preferred clothing level for summer was found to be 0.30 clo, whereas in winter it was 0.80 clo. Preferred air velocity was observed as 0.62 m/s in summer season and 0.27 m/s in winter. Controlling air velocity has been found to be preferred method of thermal adaptation over adjusting clothing and window opening.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"Biomass cookstoves are used by many people throughout the developing world for daily cooking, which unfortunately brings inherent risks to individuals and the environment. During the past several decades, extensive efforts have been made to mitigate the harm by developing clean burning, high efficiency biomass cookstoves. However, comparison and selection of cookstoves has proven to be difficult. Generally, cookstoves are characterized using the Water Boiling Test (WBT) or a variant thereof. The WBT protocol identifies several metrics used to assess cookstoves, such as average thermal efficiency (ηavg), turn-down ratio, time to boil, and several pollutant-based metrics. Unfortunately, the results of lab tests often are not replicated by actual users in the field. Additionally, results may vary from lab to lab and sometimes within the same lab. To provide an additional tool for assessment, this study demonstrates how to predict a cookstove's average thermal efficiency with time (ηt) which enables analyses and comparisons not possible using ηavg obtained at the end of the WBT. Model predictions were validated with several experiments. Insights and benefits of time-dependent ηt analysis include reduced testing times, identification of the reasons ηavg varies in repeated experiments, comparison of ηt at specified times even when the length of tests differ, identification of ηt characteristics between cold and hot starts, and determination as to if and when ηavg has reached steady state. The only required modification of the current WBT protocol to obtain ηt is to record water temperature with time.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"In urban centres of Mozambique, charcoal is the major energy source for cooking. Growing demand drives high wood extraction rates over increasing areas of miombo and mopane woodlands. Charcoal production can lead to changes in ecosystem service provision and woodland degradation while also significantly contributing to rural income and, possibly, poverty alleviation. As such, understanding charcoal production and trade has important implications for rural areas and for the sustainable development of woodland resources. Here, we investigate charcoal production and trade through empirical research conducted in Gaza Province, the main charcoal supply area for Maputo, Mozambique.We analyse the present structure of the main charcoal supply chains from Gaza province to Maputo and the profit distribution along them. Seven villages in the Mabalane district, Gaza, at different stages of engagement with the charcoal industry, were selected for investigation. We conducted household surveys and semi-structured interviews with key informants (village leaders, charcoal producers, licence holders, wholesalers, transporters and forest technicians), from May to October 2014.Our results highlight two main charcoal supply chains comprising four main actor groups a) Local small-scale operators producing charcoal on a small-scale with household labour, who sell to wholesalers b) Large-scale operators producing and commercialising large volumes of charcoal using migrant labour, who sell their own production to wholesalers. While charcoal production constitutes an important income source for rural households in Mabalane, under supply chain a) more than 90% of the monetary benefits do not reach local communities and remain with external agents. Two of the main factors impeding the generation of greater revenues at community level are: 1) bureaucratic burdens in obtaining charcoal commercialisation rights in the form of licences; and 2) weak institutional capacities for woodland resource governance.We conclude that access to markets and control over woodlands is key if local communities are to generate greater benefits from charcoal production while aiming at sustainable charcoal production. Strong local institutions for obtaining commercialisation rights and managing woodland resources have to be developed, while the restructuring of the licencing system in favour of small-scale producers and more rigorous control of the regulations could support this process.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"In recent years, the interest in double skin facades has increased because of esthetic reasons and for its use as passive system to save energy. Some authors have investigated their behavior related to thermal performance and energy efficiency compared to single skin facades but only considering the air cavity. The aim of this work is to identify a more efficient double glazed facade configuration that improves energy efficiency and indoor comfort conditions in buildings studying natural ventilation due to buoyancy-driven flow and heat transfer including solar radiation compared to a single skin facade. A simplified model was simulated using a computational fluid dynamics software to investigate the effects due to different cavity widths in winter and summer conditions with opened and closed vents and considering solar radiation or not. The main results obtained were that in winter closed vents is always efficient and ventilating is never beneficial. In summer closed vents is efficient in the absence of solar radiation and in its presence opened vents is favorable. Results showed the optimum air cavity width, and it was concluded that these double skin facades reduce the heating and cooling demands of a building, being more efficient compared to single skin facades.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"Camelina is well-suited to be a sustainable biofuel crop, as its seeds naturally have high oil content. The process of obtaining bio-kerosene from camelina oil by hydrotreatment is time-consuming and expensive, thus the possibility of using straight camelina oil/kerosene mixtures as fuel in terrestrial applications is considered. For this purpose, combustion tests were conducted on a burner. Three camelina oil/kerosene mixtures were tested. The influence of the variation of the fuel preheating temperature was also studied and presented. During the tests, the composition of the exhaust gas and its temperature were monitored and registered using two gas analysers. The results were compared with those obtained when the burner was fuelled with pure kerosene.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"A market transformation from inefficient and polluting fuel-based lighting to solar-LED systems is well underway across the developing world, but the extent of net job creation has not previously been defined. This article finds that current employment associated with fuel-based lighting represents approximately 150,000 jobs. New jobs will accompany the replacement technologies. A survey of major solar-LED lighting companies finds that 38 such jobs are created for each 10,000 people living off-grid for whom stand-alone solar-LED lights are suitable. Applying this metric, the number of new jobs already created from the current uptake of solar-LED lighting has matched that of fuel-based lighting and foreshadows the potential creation of 2 million new jobs to fully serve the 112 million households globally that currently lack electricity access, are unlikely to be connected to the major grid, micro-grids, or are able to afford more extensive solar systems. A likely greater number of additional jobs and employment income will be indirectly created or preserved via indirect employment, re-spending of energy savings, conservation of foreign exchange, enhanced literacy, and improved working conditions. In contrast, central grid expansion is unlikely to provide any net increase in jobs. The case of solar-LED lighting demonstrates that policymakers have tools to increase the pace of in-country job creation in the context of sustainable development, while minimizing job displacement, and improving the quality of employment. These tools include stimuli for domestic manufacturing or assembly of products; supporting peripheral businesses and services, such as training, recycling, financing, and impact assessment; and removing market barriers that slow the uptake of emerging technologies.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"Charcoal is among the most important domestic fuels in many countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Its production has been conventionally considered as an agricultural off-season activity to supplement household income and cope with harvest failures. This study used primary data at the household level from an important charcoal supplying dryland region in Kenya to evaluate if income from charcoal contributes to wealth accumulation. The findings show that small-scale producers were more dependent on income from charcoal and casual labor, the two sectors whose income was uncorrelated to wealth index. This group was the poorest among the producer groups and vis-à-vis non-producers in terms of both total income and wealth level. In contrast, large-scale producers derived about half of their income from charcoal production but had more diversified livelihood sources especially in business and agriculture. Despite the fact that charcoal income was not directly correlated with the wealth index, large-scale producers derived absolutely large income from charcoal activities which made them well-off among all the categories of households. The findings challenges the dichotomous policy debates on either promoting or banning charcoal production but necessitate better targeted policy interventions, which explicitly consider differences in charcoal producers to properly target social goals.",Volume 33,August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/33/suppl/C,16
"A two-stage line axis solar thermal concentrator consisting of a compound parabolic and an involute reflector was designed, and its thermal and optical performance was compared with that of a dual concentrator. The configuration of the reflectors with tubular absorber yields the highest possible concentration and uniform temperature distribution on the absorber. To reduce the heat loss from the absorber, the concentrator was covered with evacuated glass tube. The dual concentrator increases ray acceptance, which is defined as the ratio of the reflector aperture area to the glass cover diameter; hence, the concentrator can utilize incident solar radiation more effectively with only a slight increase of 28% in the glass cover circumference. This suggests the use of dual concentrators in multiple concentrator units owing to their lower component cost. The performance was evaluated by using a ray-tracing model for two-dimensional (2D) geometry. The average optical efficiency of dual and single concentrators was 57% and 37%, respectively. The thermal efficiency of the dual concentrator was 21% higher than that of single one at the absorber temperature of 373 K for the gray surface absorber. On the other hand, the selective surface absorber significantly increased the performance, suggesting that the concentrator can be used in high-temperature applications such as steam generation. Annual and seasonal performances were analyzed as well. Assuming infinite length of the line-axis concentrator's absorber pipe allows ignoring the end effects; thus, a 2D approach was adopted. As a result, the dual concentrator showed better performance for all seasons; however, the solar utilization time of both concentrator types became shorter during the winter and summer solstices because of the weak insolation resulting from the orientation of the concentrators. Therefore, a slight seasonal adjustment or a modification of the geometry is required for longer utilization.",Volume 32,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/32/suppl/C,17
"This paper presents a case study of charcoal producers supplying a small town in central Mozambique, as a contrast to the predominant focus of previous work on charcoal supply to major urban areas. It gives an in-depth account of the situations in which people produce charcoal, linking this to the role it plays in their livelihoods. Charcoal is made for a diverse set of reasons ranging from women wishing for financial autonomy from their husbands, through to gaining supplementary income from field opening. Those making charcoal have a wide range of livelihood strategies and produce in a wide range of situations. The findings counter the idea that charcoal production is a livelihood of last resort. Furthermore, the current de-facto licencing regime facilitates this diversity, but stands in contrast to the law. Enforcing the full requirements of the law would possibly reduce the flexible opportunities for income that charcoal provides for many households within the study area.",Volume 32,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/32/suppl/C,17
"Biomass fuels are widely combusted in rural China, producing numerous air pollutants with great adverse impacts on human health. Some improved cookstoves and pellet fuels have been promoted. To evaluate the performance of pellet-gasifier stoves, efficiencies and pollutant emissions were measured following International and Chinese water boiling tests (WBTs). Compared with traditional stoves and unprocessed biomass fuels, increased efficiencies and lower emissions of pollutants including carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), parent and derivative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were revealed for pellet-gasifier stoves. However, the calculated emission rates (ERs) of CO and PM2.5 cannot meet the ER targets recently suggested by WHO indoor air quality guidelines (IAQGs). Better control of air mixing ratio and gross flow rates of primary and secondary air supply greatly reduced emissions and increased efficiencies. Differences among testing protocols are the key factors affecting the evaluation of stove performance. With longer burning duration and higher power, the Chinese WBT had statistically higher efficiencies, gas temperature, and lower pollutant emissions (p < 0.10) compared to those obtained through the International WBT. Statistically significant differences between the two protocols indicate the need for further efforts in emission tests and methodology development before the release of a well-accepted international testing protocol.",Volume 32,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/32/suppl/C,17
"The aim of this work was to evaluate the reliability of building energy performance methodology and to determine the significance of the building air tightness.This paper presents a study on the significance of the building air tightness for 27 single-family detached houses, which were built in Central Lithuania during 2007–2011. Results of the field study and calculations indicated that air tightness of A class buildings corresponded to regulation requirements, ACH50 ≤ 0.6 (air changes per hour at a 50 Pascal pressure difference between interior and exterior). There was a large variation in respect of B and C class buildings. The 90% confidence interval of ACH50 value was between 4.17 and 8.05. The results showed that Lithuanian buildings of B and C energy performance class were not sufficiently tight. The average the air change rate, when air pressure of 50 Pa was present, was 2 times higher than the regulatory value (ACH50 = 3 air change per hour). This work presents the ACH50 values' distribution according to the qualifying indicator Cq for A, B, C class buildings. Part of the presented ACH50 values of B class buildings are close to the value applicable to C class buildings. When air tightness of the buildings is evaluated, B energy performance class buildings can turn out to be C class.Results of an existing building's energy performance calculations are reliable only after verifying that the building is air tight. Otherwise, the actual heating energy consumption in buildings can significantly differ from the value calculated as per regulations if air tightness is ignored.",Volume 32,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/32/suppl/C,17
"An energy use survey of 237 households was carried out in rural Anding district, Gansu province, P.R. China in 2010. Baseline lighting electricity use was assessed for current (2010) and future use (2020) and compared by light bulb type, household room, and seasonal differences. A simple life cycle assessment (LCA) compared strategies such as replacing incandescents with CFLs and reducing total daily hours of lighting to assess possible greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Replacing incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) has the potential to reduce current and future annual energy use by 27% and 23% respectively. Within households, replacing bedroom light bulbs with CFLs reduces GHG emissions most, over 38% of the total CO2 equivalent reductions possible.

"Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) for residential appliances have been part of the Mexican national energy policy since the early nineties. This study analyzes the impact of MEES on residential electricity consumption and the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions related to refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, televisions and lighting products in Mexico. The paper presents estimated achievements of MEES from 1990 to 2012 and future scenarios until 2030 by implementing stricter MEES based on the best technology available. A replacement technology model was developed to estimate, saved energy and avoided CO2 emissions for different appliances' lifetimes. Considering a 16-year average lifetime of appliances and 80% penetration of efficient lighting technologies, in 2013 energy savings were estimated to be 16.06-TWh (emission reduction of 9.5 Tg CO2).

"In a temperate climate such as that of Romania, due to the high differences between comfort parameters and temperate environmental conditions, energy is needed in order to achieve a comfortable indoor environment in both winter and summer. Yet, due to the higher initial investment cost, in Romania, the new solutions for highly energy efficient buildings are rarely used. In order to increase the awareness of the investors on the long-term advantages of these solutions, pilot projects are necessary that provide real-time monitoring on the energy performance and behaviour of energy efficient buildings.At the Politehnica University of Timisoara, an experimental programme was developed to demonstrate that applying passive house design principles could be an alternative solution for energy-efficient buildings, reflecting the Romanian local climate conditions, materials, and construction techniques. An energy-efficient house was built following the passive house design principles and was subjected to extensive monitoring. In the design phase, the discussed house is compared to a reference house designed following the energy efficiency requirements in Romania, in order to emphasise the differences in terms of energy demand and life-cycle cost. The life-cycle cost analysis results are dependent on the future growth of energy prices. The study contains the results from the monitoring campaign of the energy efficient house, including the monitoring of the energy consumption as well as of the indoor parameters.

"Traditional methods of energy planning are likely to provide results that may be inappropriate in fragile and conflict-prone countries. The risks of violence and damage, or significant delays and cancellations in infrastructure development, are rife in these states. Thus, least-cost planning processes must explicitly address the inherent risks. While there are numerous statistical methods for dealing with decision making under uncertainty, few of them have been applied to power system planning and tailored for these situations. We present a general theoretical framing of the issue and illustrate application of a very simple method to a case study of the Republic of South Sudan.

"We used primary data collected from 163 households in an off-grid Rwandan village to provide insights into energy poverty at the household-level. Informed by the rural livelihoods literature, we constructed a novel asset- and income-based index to disaggregate our results by socio-economic status. We also employed microeconometric techniques to investigate the determinants of household willingness-to-pay for electricity. We found statistically significant differences between households of different socio-economic status for expenditure on lighting and other electricity services, willingness-to-pay for electricity, income-generating activities and food security. Overall, our findings suggest that initiatives aiming to end energy poverty and catalyze rural development should: (1) recognize the different potential impacts of policies on households of different socio-economic status; (2) be sensitive to energy stacking behavior; (3) take a holistic approach to rural development; (4) and ensure that households are able to access modern energy through flexible payment schemes and equitable and sustained improvements in income.",Volume 32,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/32/suppl/C,17
"Cookstove studies have reported pollutant concentrations (mainly PM2.5, black carbon and CO) without routinely associating it with the design and operating principles of the stoves. Extensive characterization of pollutants from cookstoves and the effect of different operating conditions are required for a better understanding of the mechanisms of pollutant formation. In this study, a forced draft (FD) and a natural draft (ND) gasification-based improved cookstove were tested under controlled conditions. Real-time pollutant concentrations, both particulate (PM2.5, lung-deposited surface area and particle number size distribution) and gaseous (CO, CO2 and NOx), from these stoves using three types of fuel (applewood chips and chunks, cowdung cake and coal) along with different cookstove operating conditions (airflow rates and with or without a cooking pot) were measured and compared. The FD cookstove tended to exhibit higher concentrations of emissions compared to the ND cookstove. Increasing airflow through the FD stove decreased flame length and the residence time of VOCs inside the flame zone, which in turn increased pollutant concentrations. An optimum airflow producing the lowest particulate matter (PM) concentrations was established for the FD cookstove. The CO–CO2 ratio, an indicator of combustion efficiency, demonstrated strong correlations with PM2.5 (r = 0.857), particle geometric mean diameter (r = 0.900) and the total surface area concentration (r = 0.908) indicating that CO–CO2 ratio may be used as a proxy for these PM metrics.

"Isolated diesel systems are the main electricity generation method in many rural areas nowadays and represent a viable option to supply un-electrified villages in the Global South. However, this generation scheme leads to a dependency on fossil fuels and their price volatility on a global market with a projected increase of costs in the future. At the same time, high carbon dioxide emissions increase environmental costs. Up to date, many hybrid mini-grid pilot projects and case studies were performed globally to assess how the inclusion of renewable energy in these systems can enhance technical and economic performance. This provides insights in local characteristics and challenges of that approach on a case by case basis. This study, on the other hand, takes a look at the overall global potential for solar–battery–diesel mini-grids for rural electrification and derives a comparative analysis of the respective regions. The introduction of a GIS-based analysis in combination with a sophisticated mini-grid simulation allows a highly automated approach to draw global conclusions with the option to downscale to local regions. The results of the methodology show that in many regions substantial LCOE reductions are achievable by introducing solar–battery–diesel systems compared to pure diesel systems. Furthermore, the crucial role of spatial varying of diesel fuel prices over different regions and the impacts on the feasibility of solar–battery–diesel systems can be observed.",Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18

This study employs a 1990–2008 panel dataset to conduct an econometric analysis of policy instruments, namely, feed-in tariffs, quotas, tenders and tax incentives, in promoting renewable energy deployment in 27 EU countries and 50 US states. The results suggest that renewable energy policy instruments play a significant role in encouraging renewable energy sources, but their effectiveness differs by the type of renewable energy policy instruments. Findings reveal that feed-in tariffs, tenders and tax incentives are effective mechanisms for stimulating deployment capacity of renewable energy sources for electricity, while the other commonly used policy instrument – quota – is not.",Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18
"As a result of the rising energy needs and environmental concerns, carbonized briquettes have been looked at as a possible substitute source of energy for charcoal in most of the developing regions. However their use and adoption in Uganda cannot be rated amidst continued increase in charcoal demand from the ever growing urbanization. This study therefore investigated burning performance and cost in affecting briquette use. A comparative performance analysis was carried out for locally purchased carbonized briquettes made from matooke peels plus other household wastes and charcoal fuel denoted as A, B, C, and D, using a nested design. Calorific value, ash content, moisture content, burning time, and time of boil as well as cost per kilogram and per energy output, were the parameters compared. Results showed that gross calorific values were comparable for the two fuel types in the range of 4663–6517 kcal/kg. However, the average cost per energy output of briquettes as received was more than twice that of charcoal. This implies that briquettes are not worth their price since their calorific values are comparable to those of charcoal. The least expected was that shape and size of briquettes did not have influence on burning time and time of boil, an indication of briquette adulteration. Therefore further research needs to look at how the cost per energy output of briquettes can be reduced to be comparable to that of charcoal without compromising the quality. This work will contribute to monitoring policies and promote efficient briquette production methods to reduce the cost of briquettes in order to create a competitive edge against charcoal. But at the moment, charcoal users may not be attracted to briquettes due to their high cost per energy output, calling for an alternative path of household waste utilization to provide sustainable energy.",Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18
"Due to the rapidly decreasing costs of small renewable electricity generation systems, centralized power systems are no longer a necessary condition of universal access to modern energy services. Developing countries, where centralized electricity infrastructures are less developed, may be able to adopt these new technologies more quickly. We first review the costs of grid extension and distributed solar home systems (SHSs) as reported by a number of different studies. We then present a general analytic framework for analyzing the choice between extending the grid and implementing distributed solar home systems. Drawing upon reported grid expansion cost data for three specific regions, we demonstrate this framework by determining the electricity consumption levels at which the costs of provision through centralized and decentralized approaches are equivalent in these regions. We then calculate SHS capital costs that are necessary for these technologies provide each of five tiers of energy access, as defined by the United Nations Sustainable Energy for All initiative. Our results suggest that solar home systems can play an important role in achieving universal access to basic energy services. The extent of this role depends on three primary factors: SHS costs, grid expansion costs, and centralized generation costs. Given current technology costs, centralized systems will still be required to enable higher levels of consumption; however, cost reduction trends have the potential to disrupt this paradigm. By looking ahead rather than replicating older infrastructure styles, developing countries can leapfrog to a more distributed electricity service model.",Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18
"Microgrids offer a pathway for electricity access to communities located far from the existing grid. Although the simulated operation of microgrids is well-reported in the literature, there is a dearth of analyses based on post-installation high-resolution measured data. This article examines the operation of hybrid solar/wind microgrids using measured data from a 5 kW system in Muhuru Bay, Kenya. The system was outfitted with data acquisition and broadcast equipment that samples battery voltage, current from the solar panels and wind turbines and other quantities on a minutely basis. Considering 14 months of data, this article provides statistical and time-series analyses and interpretation of hybrid solar/wind microgrid operation. The microgrid's energy supply and efficiency are analyzed and data-driven system diagnostic methods are presented. It is shown how microgrid controller set-points influence the prioritization of energy sources, favoring wind over solar energy, and that the long-term efficiency of the microgrid is 67%. Perspectives on how operational data can be used to improve utilization and prevent pre-mature failure are provided.",Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18
"The built environment is a major contributor to the world's carbon dioxide emissions, with a considerable amount of energy being consumed in buildings due to heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, space illumination, use of electrical appliances, etc., to facilitate various anthropogenic activities. The development of sustainable buildings seeks to ameliorate this situation mainly by reducing energy consumption. Sustainable building design, however, is a complicated process involving a large number of design variables, each with a range of feasible values. There are also multiple, often conflicting, objectives involved such as the life cycle costs and occupant satisfaction. One approach to dealing with this is through the use of optimization models. In this paper, a new multi-objective optimization model is developed for sustainable building design by considering the design objectives of cost and energy consumption minimization and occupant comfort level maximization. In a case study demonstration, it is shown that the model can derive a set of suitable design solutions in terms of life cycle cost, energy consumption and indoor environmental quality so as to help the client and design team gain a better understanding of the design space and trade-off patterns between different design objectives. The model can be very useful in the conceptual design stages to determine appropriate operational settings to achieve the optimal building performance in terms of minimizing energy consumption and maximizing occupant comfort level.",Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18
"In this paper, we describe the development, implementation and application of a novel mathematical procedure devoted to formulating the daily load profiles of off-grid consumers in rural areas. The procedure aims at providing such profiles as input data for the design process of off-grid systems for rural electrification. Indeed, daily load profiles represent an essential input for off-grid systems capacity planning methods based on steady-state energy simulation and lifetime techno-economic analyses, and for the analysis of the logics to control the energy fluxes among the different system components. Nevertheless, no particular attention has been devoted so far in the scientific literature as regards specific approaches for daily load profiles estimates for rural consumers. In order to contribute to covering this gap, we developed a new mathematical procedure taking into consideration the specific features of rural areas. The procedure is based on a set of data that can be surveyed and/or assumed in rural areas, and it relies on a stochastic bottom-up approach with correlations between the different load profile parameters (i.e. load factor, coincidence factor and number of consumers) in order to build up the coincidence behavior of the electrical appliances. We have implemented the procedure in a software tool (LoadProGen) which can eventually support the off-grid systems design process for rural electrification. Finally, we have applied the procedure to a case study in order to clarify the proposed approach.",Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18
"Most small island states are under economic pressure to transition from energy systems dominated by imported oil, into systems based on clean energy technologies, which are often already economically viable due to local high energy prices. Guidance on transforming energy systems is limited with few examples available to policy makers. This paper applies a technological innovation system approach to recording the development of the much-lauded Barbados solar water heating industry and applies Bergek et al.'s (2008) functional analysis approach to put forward reasons for its successful adoption. The research concludes that the Barbados solar water heater industry actually appears to be in a state of market stagnation (at around 35% penetration) and using functional analysis identifies barriers and opportunities for future growth in the local and regional solar hot water heater market, as well as proposing the key actor networks necessary for success in sustainable energy technology based innovation system for small island states.",Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18
This paper traces the origins of the Petroleum Equalization Fund (PEF) in Nigeria and describes the environment in which it has operated. The paper argues that the PEF has failed to live up to its mandate of equalizing the prices of petroleum products across the country. This is in part because such equalization schemes create arbitrage opportunities which are always prone to exploitation. The rentier nature of the Nigerian state and the prevalence of corruption in the country have added fodder to such exploitations. The consequence of the above is that PEF has simply become one of the inefficient channels of subsidizing the price of petroleum products in Nigeria. This paper therefore recommends that the starting point in the efforts by the Nigerian government to undertake petrol subsidy reform in the country should be to abolish the PEF.,Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18
"This article aims to analyze not only the limits but also the potentialities of Jatropha curcas as an alternative energy source to the most common energy sources, such as firewood and charcoal, utilized in Northern Ghana. In 2010, a Participatory Rural Appraisal was conducted in seven rural communities in the West Mamprusi District (Northern region, Ghana). In this context, J. curcas plantations were promoted at smallholder scale and 480 ha of decentralized J. curcas plantations has been established, involving 1,200 farmers (0.4 ha of land per farmer). J. curcas was cultivated only on marginal soil, defined as lands unused for at least 2 years. The proposed J. curcas system could potentially replace, in terms of energy content, 21% of firewood or 21.8% of charcoal monthly used by households, with comparable costs and time , respect to the traditional energy sources.",Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18
"In the northern hemisphere, neighborhoods are often preferred to be laid out in a rectilinear gridiron pattern with half of the houses in double-lot blocks having south-facing facades for optimal use of available solar energy. Adjoining houses, with north-facing facades, receive minimal insolation, leading to an overall inequitable use of available insolation. This paper presents a method of determining the overall optimal block orientation using 3ds Max software with linear regression models. The city of Sulaimani, Iraq, is used to illustrate. Obtaining the optimal orientation is essential for guiding planners in the land subdivision process, before the lots are designed. To optimize sustainable and equitable exposure to insolation in the city of Sulaimani, the annual insolation value (AIV) was calculated based on the algebraic sum of the amount of insolation energy for each double facade at each 5°, then factored by the cooling and heating degree-day ratio for each month. These values represent the annual energy required for cooling and heating for each orientation. The insolation inequity index (III) was proposed to measure the inequity between various opposite orientations. Accordingly, the value of (III) is equal to one for the ideal case (zero inequity). All orientations were examined, and the (0°–180°) demonstrated the highest inequity (III = 0.60), which indicates 40% inequity while the highest equity (III = 0.98) was (110°–290°). Nevertheless, the last orientation was not the most sustainable because its total (AIV) was not the minimum. The optimal direction was determined to be (100°–280°), which has the minimum total (AIV) of 484 kWh (maximum sustainability) with the largest value of (III = 0.92) (maximum equity). It was found that if this optimal orientation was applied in Sulaimani, the inequity would have been reduced by 22% from III = 0.70 in 1955 to III = 0.92 in 2003.",Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18
"This paper assesses market development as a sustainable approach to increasing the use of renewable energy, specifically solar, using the case of Ghana's Solar Project. This strategy is intended to overcome some weaknesses of donor-driven and fee-for-service models in sustaining gains beyond the end of projects. The literature shows that developing a sustainable market for solar products in underserved rural areas requires an integrated approach addressing demand, supply, financing, quality, and facilitation. The Ghana Solar Project was well designed to overcome constraints in all of these areas. Results were positive in terms of numbers of systems purchased and impact on perceived benefits and willingness to pay. Benefits were documented with respect to education, information, mobile phone charging, income generation, and health and fire risks. Competition increased, and system costs fell. Financial institutions expanded their products and outreach, and in most cases had good recovery rates. Nevertheless, sustained market growth may be constrained by the lack of local technicians and spare parts and by possible withdrawal of some local Rural and Community Banks from providing financing and Solar Project Officers to facilitate the process, in the absence of a line of credit and results-based bonuses.",Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18
"Cross flow hydrokinetic turbines (HKTs) have some advantages and some disadvantages compared to axial flow HKTs. Fixed pitch cross flow HKTs suffer from lack of starting torque, torque ripple and shaking. It has been shown theoretically that these problems can be greatly reduced by means of variable pitch, but there is very little experimental data available on the actual performance of variable pitch HKTs. Two small cross flow hydrokinetic turbines with sinusoidally pitching straight blades were tested by driving them through still water to simulate a stationary deployment in a tidal flow. A 1 m diameter turbine with a passive eccentric mechanism was tested in open water, and a 0.5 m diameter turbine with cam-driven pitch was tested in a laboratory tow tank. A strong Reynolds number effect was observed, with peak performance coefficients ranging from 0.1 for the 0.5 m diameter turbine at 0.5 m/s in the towing tank, up to about 0.32 for the 1 m diameter turbine in open water at about 1 m/s, suggesting that larger turbines can be expected to perform better. CFD and streamtube predictions are compared with experimental data. Two-dimensional predictions, i.e. those ignoring parasitic drag loss, are shown to over-predict performance, and there is a need for modeling that accounts for these losses.",Volume 31,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/31/suppl/C,18
"India is a country where 300 million people still live without access to formal electricity, and where hundreds of millions more live with irregular supply through the existing grid network. This paper examines business innovation in the diffusion of off-grid solar technologies in India. An in-country survey of off-grid solar energy providers from across the nation was conducted and coupled with extensive field interviews. Findings reveal that most off-grid solar energy enterprises are not operating in the government subsidy market and that more than half are not offering any form of financing to their customers when selling their products. Also, more than half of the enterprises are selling their products in areas where the electric grid is present. Analysis of data collected suggests that an increase in product categories (lanterns, solar home lighting systems (SHS), micro-grids, etc.) negatively affects unit scaling for a firm but increases the likelihood that the firm is offering financing for its products. In areas without the electricity grid, the number of off-grid solar technology options decreases because the firms operating in the area have fewer categories of technology options. This study finds that off-grid solar technology enterprises that focus on fewer technology categories are more likely to achieve unit scaling. This finding must be balanced with the fact that the extent of the grid has not inhibited the market for off-grid solar technologies, but rather affects the number of categories of technologies that can be offered in those regions. Development programs should thus recognize that those who need electricity access the most may be the ones with the most limited technology options.",Volume 30,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/30/suppl/C,19
"Increasing fuel prices, concern about climate change and future energy security have led to tremendous global interest in the use of liquid biofuels in the transport sector which, in turn, has driven large-scale land acquisitions in developing countries for biofuel feedstock production. However, regardless of the vast nature of reported land deals and widespread concern about their potential negative consequences, implementation of most of the reported biofuel land deals in Ethiopia has not yet happened. Using a case study of large-scale jatropha plantation in Ethiopia, this paper examines the main causes underpinning the disappointing agronomic performance and finally termination of large-scale jatropha plantations. Although it has been argued that jatropha can be commercially grown well on marginal land without irrigation, this study indicates that moisture stress was the key factor in the failure of many large-scale jatropha plantations in Ethiopia. Furthermore, the use of untested planting material and conflict with local communities over the land were other important factors that contributed to termination of jatropha projects.",Volume 30,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/30/suppl/C,19
"Measuring energy access through binary indicators is insufficient, and in some cases even misleading. In this work, we critically evaluate the World Bank’s multi-tier framework (MTF) to measure household electricity access using a household survey in rural Bangladesh. We argue that the MTF addresses multiple objectives, thereby offering less value as a single composite index than as a set of dimensions along which to evaluate different aspects of electricity access. We test the robustness of the framework to alternative specifications as regards the choice of attributes and tier thresholds. The study shows that access measurement is highly sensitive to changes in parameter values, the application of different algorithms, and data availability. We also discuss the wider implications of applying the framework to current electricity access intervention programs in Bangladesh, provide feedback on the MTF’s design, as well as suggest potential improvements for its application in the future.",Volume 30,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/30/suppl/C,19
"Wind turbine for low power applications is a clean energy alternative to contribute global warming mitigation. The correct description of wind speeds is crucial to determine the economic viability of a wind power project. The sampling technique used in resource assessment is supported by van der Hoven's work, which concludes that minimum dispersion occurs between 0.1 and 2 hours mean time. International standards for wind turbine power characterization are also based on this work. Here we analyze the influence of using different mean times over data dispersion and wind resource assessment and analyze an adequate mean time for small wind turbine (SWT) applications that contributes to the development of reliable resource assessments. We found a maximum dispersion around 1 minute mean time. The stable wind conditions region was not found in the dispersion analysis presented here. Using this time in SWT resource assessment will detect the largest amount of changes in the time series that may contribute to power production. Resource assessments calculated show that using 1 and 10 minutes as mean times generates power resource assessments with a difference around 17%, which may be a factor that prevents SWT penetration. There exist at least two factors to obtain reliable power resource assessment, the SWT selection and ensemble mean time.",Volume 30,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/30/suppl/C,19
"The inequity of costly and low-quality fuel-based lighting is compounded by adverse health and safety risks including burns, indoor air pollution, poisoning due to accidental ingestion of kerosene fuel by children, compromised visual health, maternal health issues, and reduced service in health facilities illuminated solely or sporadically with fuel-based lighting. This article compiles and synthesizes information on the health and safety impacts of fuel-based lighting from 135 reports spanning 33 countries. Energy efficient, off-grid lighting solutions offer the most promising and scalable means to eliminate adverse health outcomes, while lowering lighting costs and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.

Moreover, a new method to evaluate the sustainability is proposed regarding technical, economic, social/ethical, environmental and institutional/organisational dimensions. The case study of Pucara (Peru) is presented, in which a RE project with six different technologies was implemented and the integral community management model was designed in 2011.

"The use of wood as feedstock for the production of energy and chemicals is a strategy used by both developing and developed countries because it increases the sustainability of their energy infrastructure. Torrefaction of forest resources for co-firing and densification of biomass energy is among the most prominent alternatives. This study is focused on technical aspects of torrefaction technology by analyzing both energy and exergy changes through a comprehensive physico-chemical model (Aspen One v8.6 software) of a plant operating in mild (250 °C) and severe (280 °C) regimes. The main wood species in Chilean plantations, Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus radiata, were processed in a lab-scale apparatus to obtain the data for model calibration. We found that xylan composition in hemicelluloses has a considerable effect on global thermal efficiency, volatiles energy content, energy density, and exergy yield of torrefied product. The highest efficiency (96%) is obtained for Eucalyptus at 250 °C when moisture in the feedstock is ≤ 20%. Combustion of volatile products (torgas) for drying does not result in substantial technical benefits for the overall process; however, their post-combustion does lead to lower exergy losses.",Volume 29,December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/29/suppl/C,20
"In order to produce briquettes that meet the needs of consumers, different combinations of raw materials and methods were used to produce rice-husk briquettes using a locally fabricated multi-piston press. Particle size, husk–bran ratio, drying method, and water temperature for briquetting were the main influencers of the hardness of rice-husk briquettes at constant pressure. The briquetting process increased the density of rice husk from 120 to 600 kg/m3. The average time for making nine briquettes (loading, compressing, ejection, and transfer to drying tray) was 3.6 min (150 briquettes/h) using the locally fabricated piston press. Briquettes produced using fine particles (< 0.3 mm), hot (97 °C) water, husk–bran ratios of 0:1, 1:2, 1:1, 1:0, 2:1, and dried in the sun for 21 days had mean hardness values of 132, 89, 76, 62, and 31 N. Four types of fuel briquettes were produced: husk–bran–palm press fiber (HBF), husk–bran–palm press sludge (HBS), husk–bran only (HBO), and husk–biochar–clay (HBC). The four types of briquettes recorded shorter start-up time (< 5 min) than charcoal (10 min). The average flame temperatures of HBF, HBS, and HBO during the first 20 min were higher (898 °C) than the average temperature of charcoal (546 °C). The characteristics of HBF and HBO briquettes provide the best option for consumers, especially those in the rice parboiling industry, as these briquettes recorded the following values for hardness (170 and 101 N, respectively), start-up time (2 and 3 min), burning rate (126 and 145 g/min), specific fuel consumption (121 and 136 g/l), and flame temperature (684 °C and 728 °C).

"In 2012, Spain obtained 68.5 TWh of its electricity (25% of the total) from renewable energy sources excluding large hydroelectric power (RES-E). Subsidies, through feed-in-tariffs, for various forms of RES-E ranged from 40.2 €/MWh to 321.1 €/MWh and totaled 6.1 billion E, an amount that has motivated substantial criticism. This paper examines the effects of RES-E on the market price of electricity considering the merit order effect in Spain's power auction system. The M5P algorithm developed by Quinlan (1992) is used to calculate changes in the settling price in daily power auctions. Also, the value of emissions of CO2, NOx, and SOx avoided through RES-E is calculated. They are valued at $10/t, $478/t, and $1460/t, respectively. Results of the analysis show that, in 2012, RES-E caused an estimated 3.1 B€ savings in electricity expenditures due to market effects and a 0.7 B€ saving in emission costs. When subtracted from the total subsidy a net cost of RES-E of 2.3 B€ is derived. Wind, biomass, and small hydroelectric had negative net costs (i.e., net benefits) while photovoltaic and solar-thermal power had net costs. Alternative scenarios in which the production of gas-fired and coal-fired electric power are individually curtailed by 30% in comparison to the baseline scenario, while RES-E is held at the 2012 level, yielded a net cost decrease of about 300 M€ for gas curtailment and a net cost increase of about 300 M€ for coal curtailment.",Volume 29,December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/29/suppl/C,20
"Improving access to sanitation is one of the most effective means to improve public health. Anaerobic digestion of high-strength undiluted human simulant excreta was investigated in laboratory systems. The focus was on demonstrating the suitability of using simple unmixed anaerobic digesters for the treatment of a simulant high-strength undiluted human excreta and to quantify the effects of high ammonia concentration on the biogas yield. A maximum biogas yield of 0.44 NLbiogas g− 1COD was obtained in batch experiments, while yields of 0.38 and 0.24 NLbiogas g− 1COD were obtained at 5 and 8 g total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) L− 1, respectively. Using an inoculum acclimated to high ammonia concentrations was critical to successful biogas production at these high TAN concentrations. Stable long-term anaerobic digestion of simulant human excreta at ammonia concentrations ranging from 5.20 to 7.15 g-N L− 1 was obtained in a scaled-down mimic of a low cost floating dome anaerobic digester. Overall, the results demonstrate that anaerobic digestion of undiluted human simulant excreta in simple unmixed digesters is feasible and yields biogas, which is a valuable commodity.

"In addition to implementing Renewable Energy (RE) initiatives, sector regulators also have roles to play in promoting Energy Efficiency since EE can be expanded via utility actions (incentivized and monitored by the regulator) and actions by other agencies. The former include reduced line losses, improvements in load patterns and system reliability, decision-relevant customer billing information, energy audits, and smart grids. The adequacy and cost-effectiveness of utility programs clearly fall under regulatory oversight. Other agencies set appliance standards and provide government financial support. The sector regulator must then factor in the interdependencies among EE programs when determining the cost-effectiveness of utility-based programs. EE promotes energy conservation, so such programs impact utility revenues and costs (directly through changes in consumption and production patterns and in program costs). These impacts mean that the energy sector regulator can promote or block some EE initiatives carried out by the electric utilities.",Volume 29,December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/29/suppl/C,20
"In this article, the environmental impacts associated to cofiring coal with forest biomass for electricity production in Chile are analyzed for: (i) untreated pine pellets and (ii) torrefied-pretreated pine pellets. Results show that energy production from cofiring coal/untreated wood pellets or coal/torrefied pellets, featured significant reductions in environmental impacts, as compared with pure coal plants. Indeed, reductions in acidification (28–26%), abiotic depletion (15–7%), eutrophication potential (15–12%), global warming potential (16–6%), photochemical oxidation (28–23%), human toxicity (17–15%), terrestrial ecotoxicity (12–9%), and marine aquatic ecotoxicity (17–15%) were obtained when untreated or treated pellets were used as a substitute for coal. Moreover, the environmental profile of torrefied pine evidenced its low impact per energy unit, in most of the studied categories except for eutrophication and marine aquatic ecotoxicity, for which the harvesting, logistic chain and torrefaction processes were the most important contributors.",Volume 29,December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/29/suppl/C,20
"Drawing on a case study of a North–South partnership between non-governmental organisations (NGOs), this paper examines knowledge–power relationships in partnerships for sustainable energy. It presents a framework for visualising and analysing the multiple knowledge challenges faced by development organisations assisting Southern communities in the adoption of off-grid renewable energy technologies (RETs). Partnerships between local and international organisations are seen as a means for meeting these challenges by bringing together complimentary skills and knowledge, but they can be affected by power imbalances between partners inhibiting their performance. Through a micro-analysis of knowledge–power relations between two renewable energy NGOs, this paper shows how the ways in which knowledge is framed and valued in partnerships for sustainable energy determine opportunities for inter-organisational learning and collaboration. Partnership models emphasising an efficient division of labour between partners and ‘North–South knowledge transfer’ may be less likely to deliver effective outcomes than previously thought. Given that the sustainable adoption of off-grid RETs requires processes of social innovation, partnerships that engage in an open negotiation of knowledge may stand a better chance of achieving ‘sustainable energy for all’ (UN, 2015). Based on a discussion of this finding, the paper concludes by proposing a participatory tool for the negotiation of knowledge and knowledge–power relations in partnerships for sustainable energy.",Volume 29,December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/29/suppl/C,20
"Biodiesel is widely promoted to replace conventional diesel based on considerations of energy security, resource depletion, and global warming mitigation. The extent of greenhouse gas emissions may vary depending upon the type of land area converted for biodiesel crop cultivation. In addition, the economy and society are also affected both positively and negatively. The objectives of the study are to 1) evaluate the effect of biodiesel demand in Thailand on types of crops, 2) estimate the magnitude of change in both land area and prices of the converted crops, and 3) assess sustainability by integrating environmental and socio-economic impacts associated with land use change. Correlation analysis, multiple regression, econometric modeling, and eco-efficiency are used in evaluating crops affected as well as percentage changes in the converted crop area and crop prices, and the sustainability of biodiesel, respectively, as the Royal Thai Government targeted in the Renewable and Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP). The study revealed that coffee, rambutan and rice are significantly affected by oil palm expansion. Consequently, the greenhouse gas emissions due to land use change arising from the AEDP are projected to be lower than without land use change. The socio-economic impacts cover positive impacts, i.e., currency savings and increases in farmers' income due to higher prices of oil palm, and negative impacts, i.e., increases in prices of foods, such as bottled palm oil, and biodiesel for energy use. Compared to conventional diesel (B0), the net socio-economic impact of 2% biodiesel (B2) is better, but 5% (B5) and 10% (B10) are worse. When land use change is integrated, the net socio-economic impacts of B5 and B10 become better than those of B0. The eco-efficiency analysis shows that biodiesel blends at 9% would be the optimum.",Volume 29,December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/29/suppl/C,20
"Thermal performance of the packed bed solar heat storage system was studied under varying solar and ambient conditions in different months. The insulated packed bed heat storage unit was filled with 8500 kg rock pebbles. The solar collection and heat retrieval efficiency of heat storage system ranged between 36–51% and 75–77%, respectively. Heat retrieval efficiency of the developed packed bed was found better as compared to the packed bed filled with phase change material (PCM). The experimental values were found in good conformity with predicted values of the packed bed temperature and hot air temperature retrieved from the bed.",Volume 29,December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/29/suppl/C,20
"Biofuels have been the subject of heated political discussions, but also of a growing literature on discourses and environmental policies. Previous studies on the issue have, however, neglected the fact that the different discourses about on biofuels are increasingly crossing national boundaries, i.e., that there is a tendency toward transnationalization. In the light of this development the present article analyzes the transnational Brazilian biofuel discourse in the period 2005–2011 with a special emphasis on actors from Brazil, the EU and the USA. By conducting a discourse analysis along the lines of Hajer, five discourse coalitions can be distinguished, each providing a different view on the opportunities, problems and perspectives of biofuel production in Brazil. It is observed that the long-established hegemony of the discourse coalition of biofuel supporters was successfully challenged by a more critical position during the food crisis of 2007/2008. As a result, the discourse coalition of critical supporters—which was committed to sustainable biofuel production via political regulation—prevailed in the transnational Brazilian biofuel discourse and its position was translated into policy measures.",Volume 29,December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/29/suppl/C,20
"This paper reviews Thailand's feed-in tariff framework for the support of solar power production and provides a feasibility analysis of residential-scale rooftop solar PV investment in Thailand under three scenarios. The initial phase of feed-in tariff support for solar power in the form of “Adder” gave rise to the dominance of solar farms, contributing currently to 99% of Thailand's solar power capacity. Since 2013, the government has begun to give a more focused support to rooftop solar power investment in the form of fixed feed-in tariff. However, the response to the government's feed-in tariff support for residential rooftop solar has been slow. Among many reasons, this paper argues that the lack of feasibility of residential rooftop solar power investment remains a key barrier. Under current market conditions, such investment could potentially be stimulated with the presence of a tax incentive and more attractive financing options.",Volume 29,December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/29/suppl/C,20
"The potential for small self-contained grid systems to provide electricity for currently unserved regions of the developing world is widely recognised. However planning and managing the electrical demand that will be supported, so that a mini-grid system is not overloaded and its available resource is used as fully as possible, is actually more difficult than for a large scale grid system. This paper discusses the mathematical reasons why this is the case, and describes a practical software tool for mini-grid demand estimation and planning that is complementary to the widely used HOMER software. This software tool is made available for download on an open source basis. Finally a conclusion is offered that mini-grid systems should aim to serve at least 50 households so that demand variability is more manageable and economies of scale can be realised.",Volume 29,December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/29/suppl/C,20
"According to the latest Global Tracking Framework (2015), 18% of the global and 57% of the African population live without access to electricity services—a key impediment towards social and economic growth. Accelerating access to electricity requires, inter alia, strategies and programmes that effectively address and account for the geographical, infrastructural and socioeconomic characteristics of a country or region. This paper focuses on considering these characteristics by developing a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based methodology to inform electrification planning and strategies. The methodology is applied to Nigeria in order to identify the optimal mix of electrification options, ranging from grid extensions to mini-grid and off-grid solutions. The case study illustrates how this optimal mix is influenced by a range of parameters—including population density, existing and planned transmission networks and power plants, economic activities, tariffs for grid-based electricity, technology costs for mini-grid and off-grid systems and fuel costs for consumers. For a certain level of energy access, on-grid connections would be optimal for the majority of the new connections in Nigeria; grid extension constitutes the lowest cost option for approximately 86% of the newly electrified population in this modelling effort with 2030 as the time horizon. However, there are some remote areas with low population densities where a mini-grid or a stand-alone solution are the most economic options; deploying some combination of solar, wind, hydro and diesel technologies depending on the locational resource availability.",Volume 29,December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/29/suppl/C,20
"A stratified air distribution (STRAD) system is a feasible air conditioning design for large space buildings that satisfies the energy conservation and thermal comfort requirements. In this paper, a novel energy efficiency index for STRAD systems is developed using theoretical analysis to properly evaluate the system's energy saving potential. Using a validated numerical model, two typical stratified air distribution designs in a hypothetical terminal building are evaluated based on thermal comfort and energy savings. The influence of supply and return diffuser distributions on the ventilation performance of these two ventilation designs is studied. When the air is supplied at mid-height, the local thermal comfort is greatly improved without sacrificing the energy efficiency due to additional return grilles located at exterior walls. When the air is supplied at floor level, installing additional return grilles at exterior walls slightly alleviates the local draft risk, but doing so largely impairs the energy saving capacity of the ventilation system. To achieve better thermal comfort and higher energy efficiency, a more uniform distribution of supply diffusers surrounding the occupied zone is suggested. When the air is supplied at the floor level, increases in solar radiation intensity can be mitigated by utilizing external shading designs, which are particularly important in preventing too large of a temperature gradient in the region exposed directly to the solar radiation.",Volume 28,October 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/28/suppl/C,21
"Climate change is expected to have impacts on the power sector, leading to, among others, a need for adaptation measures in the sector in the near future. This paper analyses the need to adapt to climate change impacts for power generation technologies in Europe until 2100. Europe is broadly divided into four geographic climate zones, for which regional climate change impacts are quantified with the help of the ENSEMBLES RT2b data. The European future technology mix is based on two Eurelectric energy scenarios: ‘Baseline 2009’ and ‘Power Choices’. A Risk Assessment Model is formulated which assesses the cost to power plants for adapting to climate change. The analysis shows that thermal generation units most urgently need adaptation measures against floods, whereas off-shore wind power plants would need to take adaptation investments against sea level rise. Furthermore, electricity grids need to adapt to the increased incidence of storms. Finally, hydro generation in the Mediterranean regions needs to adapt to lower levels of precipitation.",Volume 28,October 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/28/suppl/C,21

To examine the feasibility, experimental tests on bamboo's material properties and design analysis of a 12 m high bamboo tower for a 500 W wind turbine have been carried out. Essential material properties of a typical bamboo species for structural analysis of the tower have been experimentally determined.

"For several decades the leading wind energy nations were European, while China and India were mainly the recipients of technology transfer. This paper aims to explore the role technology transfer/cooperation from Europe played in shaping firm-level wind energy technologies in China and India and to discuss whether the recent technology cooperation between the Chinese, Indian, and European wind firms challenges the classical North–South technology cooperation paradigm. The research finds that firm-level technology transfer/cooperation shaped the leading wind energy technologies in China and to a lesser extent in India. The paper also finds that several trends towards South–North technology cooperation have been observed between China, India and Europe, such as South–North flows of capital, drivers for market access, and R&D leadership, while the origins of innovation (e.g. patents) seem to remain predominantly in the global North. The paper concludes that the technology cooperation between China, India, and Europe has become more multi-faceted and increasingly Southern-led.",Volume 28,October 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/28/suppl/C,21
"This work is a second iteration of an adaptive design project aimed at developing an appropriate off-grid technology for small-scale electricity generation in rural Malawi, and possibly for other developing countries. Stakeholder and user feedback gathered from the initial technology demonstrator field trial has been used to inform design improvements of a re-engineered technology demonstrator which has subsequently been deployed in a different region of Malawi to assess its viability, robustness and appropriateness. The ultimate aim of the project is to develop a domestic electricity generator that can provide adequate, affordable and reliable electricity for charging low-powered electrical appliances such as mobile phones, LED lanterns and radios. The technology under development is a thermoelectric generator that is powered from the heat produced by biomass-fed cooking stoves. The re-engineered generator utilises a single thermoelectric generator (TEG) to produce up to 4 W of electrical power whilst using significantly less expensive and more robust components than the first demonstrator. Ten generators were fitted to a low cost and locally manufactured clay cooking stoves and then deployed in the predominantly rural Ntcheu district. The TEG-stoves were equipped with sensors and data loggers and remained in the field for up to 6 months. The users were able to charge their mobile phones, LED lanterns and radios from the stove. None of the stoves were used every day, indicating that the users operated other stoves or cooking methods based on preference. The data obtained showed a maximum power consumption of around 4.5 W · h of energy per day, which represents a 50% increase compared to the previous field trial. The user operation of the stove generator and user behaviour has exposed unexpected, yet fixable, issues with the battery discharge protection of the charge control circuit design of the initial technology demonstrator.",Volume 28,October 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/28/suppl/C,21
"Spent coffee grounds (SCG), a processing by-product from the soluble coffee industry, was evaluated as a potential feedstock for preparing compressed logs for energy production. Hence, a blend of SCG/wood chips was transformed into densified logs using an industrial press. Chemical properties such as calorific value, ash content and elemental analysis were obtained. Combustion tests were carried out with a five-star–labeled stove in a French industrial research and development laboratory. Three different configurations were tested: a densified log containing 20 wt% of SCG blended with pine wood chips, another containing a mixture 50/50 wt% of SCG/pine wood chips and a classical beech log. This study is the first one that focuses on the potential of compressed logs as a new biocombustible for wood stoves. The obtained results show that the combustion of logs containing SCG leads to better yield of combustion. Nevertheless, CO and particle emissions increase when increasing the rate of SCG although the exhaust gas emissions and combustion yields always lead to the “five-star Flamme Verte” label achievement. Such attainment is essential to sell these densified biofuel logs in the French market. Results indicate that the blended densified logs are combusted rapidly leading to higher stove efficiency and therefore good heat recuperation from the stove walls. On the contrary, the addition of SCG leads to lower CO2 concentrations (7.7% and 9.05% for 20 wt% and 10 wt% of SCG, respectively). This behavior indicates that the combustion of compressed logs is not suitable for the stove design and may lead to an uncomfortable heating. One should be reminded that the evaluated stove was designed for the combustion of conventional wood logs (with respect to the NF Bois de Chauffage standard). This means that the results obtained during this study with the different densified fuel logs could be improved after an adjustment of the stove conception.",Volume 28,October 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/28/suppl/C,21
"In many parts of the eastern African region wood-based fuels will remain dominant sources of energy in coming decades. Pressure on forests, especially in semi-arid areas will therefore continue increasing. In this context, the role of liquid biofuels as substitutes for firewood and charcoal, to help reducing pressure on woody biomass and contributing to a better energy security of rural communities, has remained controversial among researchers and practitioners. At household level, the economic and technical feasibility of straight vegetable oil (SVO) was assessed mainly on Jatropha curcas, with unpersuasive results. So far nothing is known about the suitability as an energy carrier of Jatropha mahafalensis Jum. & H. Perrier, the only endemic representative of the Jatropha genus in Madagascar. This paper explores the potential of this plant as a biofuel feedstock in the agro-pastoral area of Soalara, in the semi-arid south-western part of Madagascar. Only hedge-based production was considered to rule out competition over land with food crops. Yield data, the length of currently existing hedges and energy consumption patterns of households were used to assess the quantitative potential and economic viability of J. mahafalensis SVO for lighting and cooking. Tests were conducted with cooking and lighting devices to assess their technical suitability at household level. The paper concludes that J. mahafalensis hedges have some potential to replace paraffin for lighting (though without much economic benefit for the concerned households), but not to replace charcoal or firewood for cooking. The paper recommends that rural energy strategies in similar contexts do not focus only on substituting current fuels with SVO, but should also take into consideration other alternatives. In the case of cooking, there seems to be substantially more potential in increasing the efficiency of current fuel production and consumption technologies (kilns and stoves); and in the case of lighting, solutions based on SVO need to be compared against other options such as portable solar devices.",Volume 28,October 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/28/suppl/C,21
"Brick kilns in Bangladesh use inefficient coal burning technology that generates substantial air pollution. We investigated the incentives of stakeholders in brick manufacturing in Bangladesh to help inform strategies to reduce this pollution. A team of Bangladeshi anthropologists conducted in-depth interviews with brick buyers, kiln owners, and Department of Environment employees. Brick buyers reported that bricks manufactured in traditional kilns worked well for most construction purposes and cost 40% less than bricks manufactured in more modern, less polluting, kilns. Brick kiln owners favored approaches with rapid high return on a modest investment. They preferred kilns that operate only during the dry season, allowing them to use cheaper low-lying flood plain land and inexpensive seasonal labor. The Department of Environment employees reported that many kilns violate environmental regulations but shortages of equipment and manpower combined with political connections of kiln owners undermine enforcement. The system of brick manufacturing in Bangladesh is an economic equilibrium with the manufacture of inexpensive bricks supplying the demand for construction materials but at high cost to the environment and health of the population. Low-cost changes to improve kiln efficiency and reduce emissions could help move toward a more socially desirable equilibrium.",Volume 28,October 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/28/suppl/C,21
"The mitigation of climate change requires developing alternatives to fossil fuels, while simultaneously looking for ways to increase the resilience of our socioecological systems especially those reliant on ecosystem goods and services. Forest biomass is receiving increased attention as a source of renewable fuel; yet at the same time, increased use of wood fuels raises health concerns about the adverse effects of pollution and as a possible contributor to deforestation and forest degradation. For these reasons, where people use wood fuel, policies are designed to shift people away from wood fuel and using forest biomass and up the energy ladder, typically toward fossil fuels. Using a case study from Chile, where air pollution from residential firewood combustion has become a serious issue, we show that while such policies might reduce pollution in the short term, they are unlikely to improve either human well-being or the sustainability of resource use in the long term. Instead of policies designed to reduce or eliminate wood fuel use, by examining the interlinked energy and resource subsystems and socioeconomic context within which wood fuel is used, we argue that a combination of policy interventions targeting the adoption of energy-saving technologies, while still maintaining wood fuel as a primary energy source, would yield higher economic, social, and environmental benefits.",Volume 28,October 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/28/suppl/C,21
"The Indonesian province Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) has a great potential of renewable energy, especially geothermal resources. However, electricity demand nowadays is mainly served by diesel generators. For inducing a change in the power generation portfolio the Indonesian government has formulated the goal to generate 25% of the electricity with renewable energy carriers from 2025 on. There are numerous possible ways for reaching this goal. In the course of this study a computational energy model was implemented to evaluate future system configurations. The evaluation was based on six different analysis scenarios. Particular scenario components were defined with different available options, e.g. high or low potential of renewables and the scenarios were determined by the combination of the chosen component options. The model area was divided into 10 model regions with specific properties and the temporal horizon of the model mostly covered a time period until 2032. The results showed a favored fast expansion of geothermal and hydro generation technologies in NTT. For regions without these resources electricity generation by coal fired plants was preferred over oil fired plants. However, it is recommended to keep certain capacities of oil fired plants for peak demand. Additionally, carbon dioxide tracking was included and a comparison of the emissions among the scenarios showed a significant impact of decreasing investment prices for renewable technologies and the 25% policy.",Volume 28,October 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/28/suppl/C,21
"The objective of this research is to substitute compressed biomethane gas (CBG) for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for use in industrial ceramic kilns. This is for both environmental and economic reasons. In Thailand, the ceramic industry employs directly and indirectly over 75,000 people mostly in Saraburi and Nakhon Lampang. It generates annual exports in excess of 30,000 million baht (approximately $910 million US). In 2014, it used 577,000 tons of LPG a fossil fuel. Thailand has the potential to produce renewable biomethane, from agricultural waste, in quantities to meet this demand.Small-scale ceramic kilns use two types of burners, a rocket type and a shower type. A mixing nozzle injects the fuel into the burner. This creates a natural draft which entrains the combustion air and both air and fuel exit at the burner head where ignition occurs. It is not possible to directly substitute CBG for LPG without making physical changes to these nozzles and adjusting the flow parameters. This research outlines a methodology for adapting the burners for CBG and experimentally verifying the predictions. Flame stability, temperature, emissions, and efficiency were measured and were equivalent to the LPG flames. Finally, the modified burners were tested inside a 0.1 m3 shuttle ceramic kiln and used to fire greenware. It is estimated that a cost savings of up to 30% can be obtained using CBG, with a payback period of a little over three and a half years, factoring in the cost of the changeover.",Volume 28,October 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/28/suppl/C,21
"This paper investigates the sustainability of off-grid renewable energy systems (RES) installed in rural communities. Through a solar home system (SHS) case project in Alumar Island, Philippines, the performance of users to sustain their systems was assessed using a novel approach proposed by the authors: the capacity and willingness approach. This approach was an adaptation to advancements in human development theory—the paradigm shift from the traditional resources approach to the capabilities approach, as proposed by A. Sen. The actual financial and technical performances of users were predicted using ordered logit regression analysis. It was found that financial capacity attributes, e.g., income and expenses, were prominent in explaining financial performance; know-how-related attributes, e.g., education, were prominent in explaining technical performance; and willingness-related attributes, i.e., willingness to pay, explained both financial and technical performance.

"In the northeastern region (NER) of India (eastern Himalayas), rice (Oryza sativa) is grown in ~ 70% of cultivated land. Therefore, the identification of energy-efficient rice cultivation system is important to food security and sustainable intensification (SI). Thus, six rice cultivation systems, composed of conventional direct seeded (CT-DSR), conventional transplanted (TRP), no-till (NT) DSR, NT-TRP, system of rice intensification (SRI), and mechanized TRP, were evaluated for their energy and cost efficiency. Results showed that land preparation, application of chemical fertilizers, farm yard manure, and seeding and/or transplanting operations consumed > 80% of energy input in all rice cultivation systems. Energy input was the highest in mechanized TRP (15371 MJ ha–1) and the lowest in NT-DSR (9162 MJ ha–1). Average grain yield obtained was the highest under SRI (4.72 Mg ha− 1), followed by CT-TRP (4.34 Mg ha− 1), mechanized TRP (4.23 Mg ha− 1), and NT-TRP (3.52 Mg ha− 1). Grain and biomass output energy was the highest in SRI system (148811 MJ ha–1), followed by that for the conventional TRP and mechanized TRP. The NT-DSR system was the most energy-efficient rice cultivation practice (output–input ratio: 11.00), whereas mechanized TRP was the least energy efficient (output–input ratio: 8.6). The lowest energy input (2900 MJ Mg–1) per unit of grain yield was recorded for the SRI system.

"In Mongolia, 43% of the total population lives in remote areas where supplying sufficient electricity through the existing grid is difficult due to terrain. The Mongolian government intends to utilize renewable energy systems to supply electricity in these areas and, as a first stage, financed 12 renewable energy hybrid systems but these systems failed to operate as planned. These projects are evaluated in this study based on government documents and other research reports and it is found that most of these systems are unsuccessful in providing the required services. The lessons learned from the failed installations are documented in this paper. Local technician training and user education is also important as technology transfer is very important for remote area systems. The research reveals the fact that introducing new technology does not solve a problem. To reduce the chance of failure, proper sizing and quality equipment selection are very important in such a harsh climatic zone. The results of the analysis show that inadequate attention was given to sizing the system, which led to customer dissatisfaction and unwillingness to pay.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"This paper investigated the key factors influencing the choice of cooking fuels in Ghana. Results from the study indicated that education, income, urban location and access to infrastructure were the key factors influencing household's choice of the main cooking fuels (fuelwood, charcoal and liquefied petroleum gas). The study also found that, in addition to household demographics and urbanization, the supply (availability) of the fuels influenced household choice for the various fuels. Increase in household income was likely to increase the probability of choosing modern fuel (liquefied petroleum gas and electricity) relative to solid (crop residue and fuelwood) and transition fuel (kerosene and charcoal). I therefore proposed that poverty reduction policies, provision of education and modern infrastructure, as well as provision of reliable supply of modern fuels should be part of the policy framework in promoting the use of modern fuels in Ghana, especially for urban dwellers, while for rural dwellers the focus should be on how to efficiently use traditional fuels in a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"Sustainable development in small island developing countries often hinges upon the successful adoption and diffusion of energy technologies developed abroad. To guide investments and policies seeking to promote new energy efficiency technologies academic and marketing studies often rely upon consumer self-reports of willingness to pay (WTP) for the environmental and economic benefits such technologies may provide. But marketing research has long reported disparities between consumer self-reports of willingness to pay and the actual amounts consumers will pay when making a purchase decision. This study uses the results of a survey and associated coupon distribution in Saint Lucia to contrast self-reported willingness to pay for energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) with actual consumer behavior in a developing country context. Survey responses suggested that more than 94% of urban consumers in Saint Lucia were willing to pay some price premium for a high quality CFL bulb. However, when given a coupon allowing them to purchase a CFL bulb at a price equal to or below their self-reported willingness to pay, only one-third of the consumers actually purchased the product. High income respondents, low income respondents, and younger respondents were among those most likely to not purchase a CFL bulb when offered the chance to do so at or below their self-reported willingness to pay. The presence of systematic discrepancies between self-reported willingness to pay and observed consumer behavior in CFL markets has important implications for energy efficiency market research, coupon-based incentive programs and energy policy in Saint Lucia and other developing nations.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"With the increasing global energy consumption, geothermal energy usage is set to increase in the future. Geothermal developments may result in both positive and negative environmental and socio-economic impacts. Sustainability assessment tools are useful to decision-makers in showing the progress of energy developments towards sustainability. Due to the unique characteristics of geothermal energy projects, a customized framework for assessing their sustainability is required. This paper presents the development of an appropriate indicator assessment framework, through a case-study in Iceland. The results reveal Icelandic stakeholder views on sustainability issues relating to geothermal energy projects. Environmental and economic indicators were regarded as more relevant than social or institutional indicators. A Delphi survey revealed that the priority sustainability goals for stakeholders were related to renewability, water resource usage and environmental management. The top five indicator choices were related to resource reserve capacity, utilization efficiency, estimated productive lifetime of the geothermal resource and air and water quality.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"Charcoal production has been widespread in the past and is still common where poor societies and dry forests coexist. For the Dry Chaco in South America, one of the largest remaining dry forests of the world, we describe the geographical distribution, type of production systems, environmental and social context and output of charcoal based on remote sensing (charcoal kiln detection); together with existing environmental (forest cover/biomass), social (population density, poverty), and infrastructure (roads) data. While most of the region has low kiln densities (< 1 kiln every 1000 km2), foci of higher production were found in the north of Santiago del Estero and the west of Chaco provinces (> 1 kiln every 5 km2). Individual or small groups (up to three units) prevail over the regions (58.2% of all kiln sites), frequently associated with a forest land cover. Large groups of kilns (≥ 12 units, 15.5% of all kilns) were associated with land cleared for cultivation. For a subset of kiln sites for which forest biomass data was available, we found that typical kiln sites (1–3 kilns) had half of the average biomass of the region within a radius of 125 m. Although charcoal production in the whole region has been stable for 50 years, a strong redistribution from richer to poorer provinces has taken place. At the county level, kiln density and charcoal production records showed a linear association that suggests an average output of 11 tons of charcoal per year per kiln. Comparing counties with high vs. low charcoal production with similarly high forest cover, the first had higher population density and poverty levels. Today small scale charcoal production by poor rural people represents the only significant use of forests products that provides some market incentive for their preservation. However this situation is associated with marginal social conditions, inefficient production, and forest degradation. Developing charcoal production under environmentally and socially virtuous conditions should be seen as a unique opportunity and an urgent challenge in the face of the fast deforestation of dry forests.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"Energy transition theory and its applications in energy policies and development interventions are dominated by the traditional theory of the energy ladder. The linear model predicts a positive relationship between socio-economic development and transition to more efficient, cleaner, and costly energy sources. This study demonstrates, however, that households do not follow the projected patterns. Instead, fuel and stove diversification is observed. Households use various energy carriers, modern and traditional, and devices to secure a continuous energy supply and counteract potential access and availability issues. Multifaceted demands of the households are an important driver of the diversification. Preference often concurs with the most efficient and best available stove and fuel for a particular task. Individual characteristics and social and cultural tradition influence the final choice. Therefore, broadening the range of available and accessible stove designs and fuels will help households to achieve energy security and greater efficiency in their consumption.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"Bioenergy crop models predict harvestable biomass using known variables, and illustrate key parameters that determine the crop yield. We developed a model, using the systems software STELLA, to provide a conceptual representation of Miscanthus × giganteus crop system and understand various parameters and their influence on the growth and loss of harvestable biomass. Using data from four locations, we developed a model and used it to predict yields comparable to reported biomass production from Champaign, IL, thus validating the model structure. Sensitivity analyses of model variables suggested that solar radiation, rainfall, temperature, soil water holding capacity, solar energy interception and conversion efficiency, evapotranspiration, crop coefficient, irrigation and harvest date significantly influenced the predicted harvestable biomass. The flexible STELLA platform also allows the stakeholders to expand and modify the model to incorporate additional variables if required and ultimately enables informed decision-making for bioenergy crop production at any location.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"The aim of this paper is to understand the influence of the user behavior on tubular digesters performance, through a technical and a social approach in the Bolivian context. Fifteen domestic digesters were evaluated, from which 6 were installed in the Altiplano and other 6 in the Andean Valleys. Data about slurry temperature, feedstock and biogas quality were collected from these 12 digesters, while daily biogas production and feeding pattern were also monitored from further three digesters in the valleys. Because of changes in user behavior along the monitoring period and particular characteristics of the digesters monitored, 5 complete patterns of biogas production and digester management were established. Furthermore, the results of a socio-cultural study with Andean families about the perception of poverty, their needs and the role played by digesters in their expectations in improving life quality, are correlated to the obtained technical data. The technical evaluation shows how the digester management seems to have a seasonal performance throughout the year according to the agricultural calendar. This means that families are more interested in using bioslurry in crops and agricultural improvements than in the use of biogas. The Bolivian government subsidy on liquefied gas seems to be one of the key issues to understand these results. Finally, data also reveals how the thermal behavior of tubular digesters adapted to cold climate that use a passive solar design, is similar to the thermal behavior of valley digesters, and therefore intends to add the same passive heating techniques for warm and tropical climates, to increase slurry temperatures and achieve a higher biogas production.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"Two species of Pleurotus, Pleurotus florida and Pleurotus flabellatus were cultivated on two agro-residues (paddy straw; PS and coir pith; CP) singly as well as in combination with biogas digester residue (BDR, main feed leaf biomass). The biological efficiency, nutritional value, composition and nutrient balance (C, N and P) achieved with these substrates were studied. The most suitable substrate that produced higher yields and biological efficiency was PS mixed with BDR followed by coir pith with BDR. Addition of BDR with agro-residues could increase mushroom yield by 20–30%. The biological efficiency achieved was high for PS + BDR (231.93% for P. florida and 209.92% for P. flabellatus) and for CP + BDR (148.31% for P. florida and 188.46% for P. flabellatus).

"Brazilian merchant pig iron (MPI) mills, even those relying exclusively on charcoal, are at least as harmful to the global climate as the coal-based competitors they confront in international trade. However, when timber from deforestation is replaced by sustainably managed forest plantations, a carbon neutral process emerges. Yet the cost of growing trees can be large enough to discourage mills from pursuing such a climate change mitigation route. The paper shows that the impasse can be overcome by the improvement of pyrolysis kilns coupled with a multilateral agreement in which (1) Brazil supplies attested carbon-neutral MPI and (2) importers of Brazilian MPI take environmental concerns to the field of MPI trade, paying a premium of 19% of MPI price or of US$3 per ton of avoided emissions.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"The Ten-Thousand Enterprises Program is China’s keystone energy conservation and climate change program. The program has effectively created a class of energy-intensive enterprises that are regulated by the government for energy conservation purposes. Through an empirical study conducted in Changchun, this paper shows that the adoption of energy efficiency technologies and practices has been highly uneven in this class of enterprises because of two reasons. First, a de facto two-tier regulatory system has emerged within the framework of the Ten-Thousand Enterprises Program. Central state-owned enterprises are closely regulated by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) which is a central government apparatus, whereas local state-owned enterprises and privately owned enterprises are regulated by the local government, which has fewer resources and incentives to implement the program rigorously. Second, the Ten-Thousand Enterprises Program bundles together different types of enterprises. This approach places smaller enterprises at a disadvantage and limits their ability to conserve energy.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"Thermogravimetric spectra of binderless briquettes and its raw material, soybean crop residues, were critically analyzed to ascertain the changes occurring in the intrinsic biopolymeric components such as hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin due to briquetting stresses. Transitions of thermogravimetric signals and activation energy levels were analyzed and discussed. The distinct and sharp signals related to the secondary charring process at the high temperature regime in thermogravimetry were noticed in briquettes as compared to these signals in raw residue. Integral isoconversional Friedman kinetics treatment was used to compute the conversion fraction dependent activation energies. Deconvolution analysis of differential thermograms was done to diagnose the internal thermogravimetric transformations.

"By 2017, Egypt is expected to finish its sixth hydropower plant which is associated with the new Assiut barrage. Based on any hydraulic structure's design, there is enormous kinetic energy created downstream of the gates. This super power water jet generated under dams/barrage gates creates a destructive scouring effect downstream of the gates. In this work, a novel approach for hydrokinetic energy application is presented. The new approach proposes installing a farm of hydrokinetic turbines on the stilling basin of the spillways of the barrage's gate. This approach does not only magnify the total electric energy which was untapped in the past but also dissipates the enormous kinetic energy downstream of the gates. The total expected captured electric power from the barrage reaches 14.88 MW compared to 32 MW rated value of the existing hydropower plant.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"Despite decades of effort, widespread adoption and long-term use of improved cookstoves in developing countries remain hard to achieve. Conventional energy transition models emphasize households' socio-economic improvement as the most important driver of energy transition. However, previous work has shown households' continued use of old cookstoves or fuels even when adopting new technologies. Through a case study in India, this paper highlights the socio-political processes of the permanent removal of the traditional chulha cookstove. Newly available liquefied petroleum gas stoves and improved biomass stoves, thought to be substitutes for chulha, lead to different adoption pathways for lower and higher caste households. Lower caste households seem to remove chulha more readily because of sensitivity to chulha's heavy smoke that pollutes their utensils, kitchen, and clothes. We posit that by adopting cleaner stoves and removing traditional ones, the marginalized can disassociate themselves from practices that perpetuate their social stigma.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"This paper presents a methodology to assess the cost–benefit and develop the service pricing strategy of electric taxies in Shanghai, China. There are 4 kinds of electric taxi models being structured. The total life cycle cost model for cost–benefit assessment is developed with consideration of purchase cost, usage cost, and other operation cost. Three scenarios are defined, including gasoline price increasing, electricity price increasing, and battery cost decreasing. Then the service pricing model is proposed. The results indicate that the profitability of battery-swapping model is higher than that of the charging model. The taxi models with longer driving range have greater profitability than those with shorter driving range. With annually increasing rate of 8% of gasoline price, the electric taxi will obtain the same profit with the gasoline taxi in 5 years. With annually increasing rate of 20% of electricity price, the service price of electric taxies will rise by 1%. When the battery cost decreases by 49%, the service price of electric taxies will be 4% lower than that of gasoline taxies.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"This study analyzes economic and environmental implications of the elimination of energy subsidies in Iran applying a CGE model. The subsidy reform was investigated under two scenarios namely, redistributing total subsidy revenue back to households (complete payment) and allocating it to households and producers (half payment) proportionally (50% and 30% respectively). The results show that elimination of energy subsidies via resource reallocation causes a fall in GDP relative to the initial equilibrium by at least 15%, while the general level of prices (CPI) tends to increase by more than 10% compared to the initial level. However, redistributing a part of the subsidies revenue back to households increases overall welfare. Eliminating energy subsidies induces emission reduction of most of the pollutants. Considering the economic, welfare and environmental aspects, half payment scenario is preferred compared to complete payment option.",Volume 27,August 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/27/suppl/C,22
"This article examines the technical and economic feasibility for the introduction of natural gas for electricity generation in non-interconnected insular systems. In such systems, the introduction of natural gas constitutes a fundamental perspective towards the substitution of oil or coal, commonly used for electricity production. On the contrary, the expensive transportation of natural gas for long overseas distances, the required technical infrastructures and the expected limited consumption of natural gas in islands with low populations, constitute issues that can negatively affect the feasibility of the project.The aforementioned tasks are examined in the present article for the island of Crete (Greece) chosen as a case study. The size of the island and its consequent electricity consumption create the fundamental prerequisites for the introduction of natural gas. The annual operation of the existing system and the new one, as it would be modified after the natural gas introduction, is simulated using all the required parameters and data as provided by the utility company. The annual production specific cost is calculated for both systems and the economic benefit from the substitution of oil with natural gas is evaluated. The CO2 annual emissions are also calculated for both systems.The annual electricity production cost in Crete with the introduction of natural gas is reduced 38%, while the CO2 annual emissions are reduced 54%, compared to existing levels in 2013. The required investments exhibit a payback period above 3.5 years.

"This study aims to assess the impacts of carbon emission trading scheme (ETS) policy on air pollutant emission reduction in Guangdong (GD) Province, especially with respect to the embedded air pollutant emission flow caused by carbon ETS. A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is constructed to project the local emission trajectory of CO2 and air pollutants under business as-usual (BaU) and policy scenarios in GD province and the rest of China from 2007 to 2020. To achieve the energy and carbon intensity targets, the carbon constraint and ETS policy are employed to promote energy saving and CO2 emission reduction. The simulation results show that the carbon ETS has the co-benefits of reducing SO2 and NOx emissions by 12.4% and 11.7% in 2020 compared with the BaU scenario. Along with the carbon trading volume of 633 million tons created by the ETS scenario, an embedded amount of 38,000 tons of air pollutants is exchanged among carbon trading sectors, which valued about 50 million USD.

If Iran removes the fuel subsidy, the cost of fuel would increase and the PV or hybrid PV/Generator systems would become more attractive. In this paper, a techno-economical procedure was conducted by using two definitions of loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE).

"Mitigation actions proposed by most developing countries include reductions from a business as usual baseline or reductions in emission intensities. Here we evaluate the implications of such mitigation targets in developing countries, using India as a case study. The analysis shows that for developing countries, the construction of a baseline is subject to substantial uncertainty due to a range of potential structural mixes in the future. Mitigation commitments based on such a baseline are then likely to result either in high costs of mitigation or constraints on the development choices available in the future. Results for India indicate that by 2030 an additional mitigation effort of 19% to 38% would be necessary if the contribution of industry to the GDP was higher than anticipated. Instead of a single baseline with an implicit assumption of structural composition, we propose that for developing countries, a set of alternative baselines should be considered.",Volume 26,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/26/suppl/C,23
"This article presents a unified dataset of 63 points compiled from three published laboratory studies for the most common type of improved household cookstove used in the developing world—a cylindrical, natural draft, shielded, wood-fired cookstove. Each data point includes 11 geometric variables, thermal conductivity of the stove body and insulation, lower heating value and moisture content of the fuel, heat release rate, and efficiency. Analysis of the dataset finds that the data are consistent between the studies and consistent with the current rules of thumb for the design of cookstoves. Specifically, it was found that pot shield gap, combustion chamber height, and insulation each have approximately the same impact on stove performance, increasing efficiency from roughly 20% to 40%. In contrast increases in pot shield height above 8 cm have limited impact on efficiency.

"This paper explores the prospect for achieving an equitable allocation of country-specific carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector within the framework of the Cancun climate stability target, as represented by Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6. Three allocation principles are considered, with the primary one (Egalitarian) based on equal per capita emissions for all countries by 2050. The two secondary allocation principles, termed Emission-based and GDP-based, distribute allowable emissions according to cumulative historical emissions and cumulative historical GDP respectively. Neither of these two allocation principles can deliver equal per capita emissions by 2050. Only when a global average constraint factor is introduced, designed to enable countries with less than allowed global average per capita emissions in any year to increase their emissions to this level, can emissions parity (the Egalitarian principle) be achieved by 2050. Finally, it is argued that achieving the widespread agreement needed to achieve climate stability is likely to be difficult, given both the size of reductions needed, especially by high-emission countries, and the inadequacies of the technical fixes proposed.",Volume 26,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/26/suppl/C,23

Organizations are hoping that fuel-efficient cookstoves can help solve the problem. In this study, four charcoal cookstoves intended for dissemination in Haiti were rigorously assessed and compared using Water Boiling and Controlled Cooking Tests.Due to the poor thermal efficiency of the traditional stove, all improved stoves saved fuel on average over the traditional with the majority also reducing the total emissions released. However, the traditional stove could be difficult to replace because it had the fastest time-to-boil, an important consideration for end users. Through the testing, the number of trials conducted was found to be an important consideration for error analysis.

Two different temperatures at the cold side of the TEC module are also considered to account for the influence of cooling condition on the performance of the TEC. The power generation of the TEC module with low-temperature cooling is at least 5% higher than that with normal cooling.

"Using a household survey conducted in a suburb of Tokyo, we examine whether individuals properly perceive the benefits of energy-saving actions. A bivariate regression shows that, on average, individuals overestimate the benefits. The tendency to overestimate is robust to controlling for individual and home characteristics. Our results are contrary to those of Attari et al. (2011), who found that individuals in the U.S. tended to underestimate the benefits of energy-saving activities. The difference in our results suggests that the provision of information about the benefits of energy saving may be an effective policy to address global warming issues in one country but not necessarily in all countries. We also find that the magnitude of overestimation is greatest among young single males, whereas the benefits perceived by older married females are the smallest.

Wood charcoal production and export is a major activity supporting war regimes in this area such as the extreme Islamist group Al-Shabaab. However, little quantitative information exists on the extent of this charcoal production. In this study, we developed a semi-automatic detection method to identify charcoal production sites from very high resolution (0.5 m) satellite imagery. We then applied it to a 4700 km2 area along the Juba River in southern Somalia using 2011 and 2013 WorldView-1 imagery. Based on the sites detected exclusively for 2013 we estimated an average production of 24,000 tonnes of charcoal and 2.7% tree loss for the two-year interval, using literature- and local-knowledge-based assumptions on likely ranges of kiln and tree parameters. Our large-area assessment helps to better understand the dimension and impact of charcoal production in southern Somalia and reveals a rapid depletion of tree cover.

To overcome this problem, an axial flow HKT has been designed using conventional wind turbine blade element theory and modified so as to minimize clogging by allowing one or more blades to swing back and forth in its plane of rotation. A 0.8 m diameter prototype has been constructed using low cost materials and simple tools.

"The burning of solid fuels for cooking creates significant adverse health, social, and economic consequences for more than three billion people worldwide. Recognizing this issue, many groups have worked to develop improved stoves that increase fuel efficiency, decrease fuel use, and reduce particulate emissions. Less attention has been given to developing a standardized process for rating cookstove safety and reducing cookstove hazards. This paper identifies common cooking hazards and seeks to reduce cooking injuries by proposing ten field-based safety guidelines for solid fuel stoves. Each guideline describes an underlying safety principle and is accompanied by a test protocol and a metric to rate stove safety. This incremental rating system enables stove designers, donors, and consumers to track and promote stepwise safety improvements. The protocols use low-cost equipment to allow the many manufacturers of handcrafted cookstoves to assess safety without using sophisticated testing facilities and expensive equipment.",Volume 25,April 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/25/suppl/C,24
"Exposure to combustion byproducts from cooking is a major health concern globally. Alternative stoves may reduce the burden of disease associated with exposure to household air pollution. We subsidized Ugastove-brand rocket stoves to 54 households in six rural Ugandan villages. We monitored kitchen concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) before and one month after introduction of the Ugastove. Temperature data-loggers were affixed to each Ugastove and to the traditional stove (three‐stone fire) during the 1-month Ugastove acclimation period to record temporal patterns in stove use and adoption. Household surveys were administered to collect household information that may impact stove use or indoor air quality. PM2.5 kitchen concentrations were 37% lower after introduction of the Ugastove (mean reduction: 0.68 mg/m3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2–1.2; p < 0.01). Changes in CO concentrations were small (8% lower; mean reduction: 1.4 ppm, 95% CI: – 5.2–7.9) and not statistically significant. During the 1-month acclimation period, 47% of households used primarily the Ugastove, 12% used primarily the three stone fire, and 41% used both stoves in tandem. PM2.5 concentrations were generally lowest in households that used primarily the Ugastove, followed by households that used stoves in tandem and that primarily used a three‐stone fire.

"The declaration of 2014–2024 as the Decade of Sustainable Energy for All has catalyzed actions towards achieving universal electricity access. The high costs of building electric infrastructure are a major impediment to improved access, making stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems an attractive solution in remote areas. Here, we analyze the cost-effective electrification solution for Kenya comparing grid extension with stand-alone PV systems. We use micro-data from a national household survey to estimate electricity demand for households that are within reach of electricity infrastructure and to predict latent demand in unconnected households. These regional demands are used in a spatially explicit supply model to seek for a least cost electrification solution. Our results suggest that decentralized PV systems can make an important contribution in areas, with low demand and high connection costs. We find that up to 17% of the population can be reached cost-effectively by off-grid PV systems till 2020.",Volume 25,April 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/25/suppl/C,24
"Ethanol from biomass feedstocks has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for fuel production. This work calculates the potential environmental impact from the production of ethanol from sweet sorghum using several processing options. The following three processing options were evaluated: 1) a farm scale decentralized option where all steps except the dehydration are performed on the farm, 2) a semi-centralized process where distillation and dehydration are performed at a biofuel refinery, and 3) a centralized process where sorghum stem is transported to a facility where all processing is performed. Results show that a centralized process where sweet sorghum stem is transported to a processing facility to produce ethanol has significant negative environmental impacts when compared to corn ethanol and other processing options. The centralized option resulted in a 62% increase in GHG emissions and a 50% increase in non-renewable energy use compared to corn ethanol. When the decentralized and semi-centralized options were compared to corn ethanol production, GHG emissions were reduced by 39% and 25% respectively. Non-renewable energy use reductions were 27% in the decentralized process and a 15% reduction in the semi-centralized process.",Volume 24,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/24/suppl/C,25
"This paper describes the fuelwood economy of Papua New Guinea (PNG) based on a survey of domestic users (n = 3994), commercial and industrial users (n = 66) and fuelwood vendors (n = 157). The survey period (2009) covered urban and rural, coastal and highland districts of known fuelwood-stress. The survey region represents 11% of the national population. It reveals that the fuelwood economy has a relatively flat structure with a very short and direct supply chain. Fuelwood is regularly or occasionally used by 85% of the population for domestic and commercial cooking, even in urban areas where there is good access to electricity and other energy sources. Proportions of the population selling fuelwood at some time in the survey period were 3% and 10% of urban and rural populations respectively. Those generating an income using fuelwood were 26% and 58% respectively. Fuelwood consumption is estimated to be 1.8 m3/person/year which is 6 times greater than the average of south and south-east Asian countries. It is estimated that 2.08 million m3/y of fuelwood is freely collected for domestic use in the survey region, while the amount traded was USD7.14 million. The survey provides details of regional variations in fuelwood consumption, gender relations, income generation, and conflict associated with fuelwood, tree planting activity and attitudes to the need for woodlots. It describes and quantifies fuelwood flows from various sources to users and argues the point that the impact of fuelwood collection on forests is only localised. The fuelwood economy is largely informal with no public engagement in supply, marketing, distribution, pricing, and taxation. This paper argues the case for a national fuelwood policy which will encourage the private sector to invest in fuelwood trade and create economies of scale while still protecting smaller informal actors.",Volume 24,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/24/suppl/C,25
"Though climate change is an urgent problem especially for vulnerable developing countries, international negotiations are in a gridlock. Standard game-theoretic models that describe climate change mitigation as a public good problem predict few incentives for individual countries to act. Nevertheless – despite the absence of a globally binding agreement – we can observe some developing countries launching unilateral climate policies. Being one of th\ose, Vietnam has recently announced to strive for a low-carbon economy. Based on interviews with Vietnamese policy makers and other stakeholders, this explorative case study examines Vietnam's motivation for a policy change that has shifted from emphasizing the responsibilities of developed countries for climate change towards accepting responsibility of developing countries to also reduce their emissions. While Vietnam's high vulnerability has contributed to put climate on the political agenda, the policy shift from a pure adaptation towards a mitigation focus was mainly driven by expected multiple climate policy benefits other than climate change abatement (so-called co-benefits). These include restructuring of the economy, addressing energy security concerns and accessing international finance to counteract a phase-out of conventional development assistance. Air quality considerations, by contrast, do not seem to play a major role for Vietnam's shift in climate policy.",Volume 24,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/24/suppl/C,25
"""Improved"" cooking technologies have been generally understood to be a ""win–win"" development intervention creating both environmental and development benefits. Yet dissemination of improved cooking technologies has faced many challenges. Carbon finance provides an opportunity to address some of the financial barriers in dissemination initiatives. However, the impacts of carbon finance on cookstove activities are not fully understood. Using India as a case study, this research examines how carbon financing is impacting cookstove dissemination efforts. Specifically this study identifies which actors in the Indian cookstove arena are engaged in carbon financed initiatives and how this is changing their business models and for those not applying for carbon finance, what their rational for this choice is. Results based on 19 semi-structured interviews provide an overview of different organizational approaches employed, perceptions around carbon financing, and identification of the opportunities, challenges and unknowns surrounding the use of carbon finance for cookstove dissemination.",Volume 24,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/24/suppl/C,25
"Rapid urbanization in the developing world underscores the policy challenge of urban energy poverty. This article investigates patterns of energy poverty in Patna, the capital of the state of Bihar in India. Informed by the field research, our emphasis is on inadequate lighting among street vendors. A survey of 1000 street vendors in the metropolitan area reveals high levels of energy poverty, with vendors being forced to choose between inadequate lighting and expensive power from diesel generators operated by local entrepreneurs. The survey also shows that vendors consider improved lighting a top priority and believe that improved lighting could expand their business and attract customers. While vendors are generally aware of solar panels, a few are using this technology in the marketplaces. The results reveal the need for new policy interventions that either promote grid access for the informal economy or seek new alternatives, such as solar lighting, to diesel generators.",Volume 24,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/24/suppl/C,25
"In this work, the technical feasibility of cotton stalk carbonization and torrefaction was studied. A metallic homemade cylindrical furnace 60 cm in diameter and 90 cm in height was used for the experiments. A partial combustion process was used both for carbonization and torrefaction. Three carbonization methods were defined based on the amount of air supplied and cotton stalks introduced in the kiln. Torrefaction process was based on a shorter combustion time of 2 min during the partial combustion, in order to avoid cotton stalk carbonization. Mass and energy yield, proximate analysis and the unburnt cotton stalks proportion (ratio of non-carbonized cotton stalks over carbonized cotton stalks) for each process were determined. In order to avoid the burning of the loaded cotton stalk, and to optimize charcoal quality, an appropriate combustion time of 7 min was found for the carbonisation process. The anhydrous mass yield for the best carbonization process selected is about 28.4% while energy yield is 45.8%. The carbonized cotton stalk has 24.15% and 67.44% of volatile matter and fixed carbon content respectively. The carbonized cotton stalks are suitable for cooking purpose because their volatile matter content allows a rapid ignition. The torrefaction process has a mass and energy yields of 64.1% and 75.3% respectively. Torrefied cotton stalks are more appropriate for gasification compared to carbonized cotton stalks.",Volume 24,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/24/suppl/C,25
"Minimum energy performance standards (MEPSs) have been adopted in several countries to promote energy efficiency. This study evaluates the impacts of Law 10.295/2001 which regulates the efficiency of equipment in Brazil. This impact assessment was based on estimates of the amount of equipment in operation and the effect of MEPS on a representative model of equipment, in some cases considering efficiency degradation and operation conditions different than those assumed in efficiency measurement. Setting MEPS for refrigerators, air conditioners, and electric motors resulted in an estimated 182.8 GWh savings and 70 MW demand reduction in 2010, which is relatively low due to the limited number of models removed that are affected. The energy saved due to MEPS adoption for gas stoves and water heaters was estimated at 9575 toe (401.0 TJ)1 in 2010.

"While solar home systems hold considerable promise for improving access to electricity in developing countries in tropical regions, scholars and practitioners argue that the lack of awareness, interest, and ability to pay for the technology undermines the growth of the market. We describe and explain patterns of awareness and interest in solar home systems (SHS) in a survey of 760 respondents in rural Uttar Pradesh, India. We conducted the surveys in collaboration with a local solar enterprise, Boond, and chose villages that are prime locations for the installation of solar home systems. We found that high household income and education levels, as well as young age, predict awareness of SHS products. In addition to wealthy and educated households, willingness to pay is higher in households that have electricity. The findings can help policymakers identify and target households with low levels of awareness and solar entrepreneurs identify suitable customers for their products.",Volume 24,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/24/suppl/C,25
"Plastic bottles (PET) are examined both structurally and thermally to be utilized as building units, replacing traditional concrete blocks. Tests were conducted after filling the bottles with either dry sand, saturated sand, or air, bound by cement mortar to produce stable masonry walls of reduced thermal conductivity.The effect of the infill material on the bulk unit weight and the compressive strength of the plastic bottle masonry blocks showed slight effect of the used infill material on the strength. Although the gross strength of these plastic bottles is much less than the traditional blocks, 670 kN/m2 compared to 3670 kN/m2, but calculations showed that the blocks of air filled bottles still can be used as suitable construction units for partition walls or as bearing walls for one roof slab.Thermal wise, air filled bottles showed better thermal insulation than the tradition block construction, which could act as thermal insulation material.",Volume 24,February 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/24/suppl/C,25
"Biofuels are controversial because of uncertain environmental benefits and reported social drawbacks, including ‘land grabs’ and threats to food security. The present study investigates the relevance of these concerns for a proposed bioethanol project in Cradock, South Africa. The proposed project is anticipated to lead to economic upliftment and could therefore contribute to reduce poverty and thus strengthen food security. With a projected annual production of up to 16,000 l ethanol per hectare, yields would be substantially higher than in most other countries. Agricultural activity would take place on existing farm land, or on biomes classified as ‘least concern’. We estimate a carbon footprint reduction of ~ 30% for sugar beet ethanol in the area. Because various global biofuel concerns do not apply to the proposed Cradock fuel ethanol project, we argue for a more nuanced approach for the evaluation of biofuel projects with more focus on case-specific attributes.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"This study presents the design and development of a rice-husk-fuelled cookstove to improve poor people's energy access in developing countries. The availability of rice husk, an agricultural by-product currently without any use, neither value, on many markets, has suggested recovering this biomass for household-cooking purposes. õAccording to typical rural socio-technical constraints, a prototype of rice husk burner has been designed. After testing various configurations, a crude-earth structure with a metal-net fuel reactor, placed inside the combustion chamber, resulted to be the most promising lay-out. A chimney induces the air flows, necessary for operation, in the combustion chamber, while eliminating harmful smokes from the living environment. The chimney also prevents the use of electrical fans, which may not result appropriately for many rural contexts. Performance results are presented, together with emission data and a safety assessment. Results from Water Boiling Tests (average thermal efficiency 18%) and Controlled Cooking Tests (specific consumption 4.2 MJ per kg of cooked food) show how this technology could represent a viable alternative to three-stone fires and other rudimentary cooking systems, allowing the recovery of energy from a waste biomass. Evidences from the safety assessment and the indoor CO monitoring demonstrate the absence of hazards in the domestic use of the stove. The study is completed by an economic analysis that accounts for the local feasibility and affordability of this specific solution in a given context.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26

One question for how to accomplish this is how to disaggregate national target to provincial level. This study employed a regional disaggregation approach based on a series of principles. Analysis of the carbon intensity revealed three main approaches to reduce CO2 are energy structure adjustment, technical improvement and energy substitution. We proposed a disaggregation model from the view of reduction approaches. Through the data collection and analysis of provinces from 2005 to 2010, a regional disaggregation scheme is carried out in which the national carbon intensity reduction target during the 12th Five-Year Plan was set at 17%.

Electric power production using biomass residues from agricultural production using high efficiency electricity generation technologies would reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contribute to climate change mitigation. This study investigated the case of the sugar industry in Thailand and identified scenarios offering GHG emissions reduction benefits. Electricity generation potential from using sugarcane residues and/or upgrading power generation systems represent beneficial options. The largest potential of electricity export to the national grid can be achieved by upgrading boiler systems of all sugar mills to 103 bar and 515 °C. Using 19% of the generated sugarcane tops and leaves along with bagasse can generate 9 TWh electricity and would reduce GHG emissions by 4.8 Mt CO2 equivalent a year.

"Climate scientists agree that a drastic reduction in carbon emissions in the coming decades is necessary to avoid major disasters due to global warming. Using computer modeling, citywide data sets, and insights from experts in the building community, we show how New York City (NYC) can lead the way toward climate change mitigation by improving the efficiency of its building sector (which is currently responsible for 75% of its greenhouse gas emissions) by 2050 using technologies available today. Though the total elimination of greenhouse gas emissions is possible only with the use of carbon-free energy sources, emissions can be reduced by over 60% from energy efficiency measures alone. After eliminating fuel combustion, carbon-free electric energy roughly equal to total electric energy used in 2010 would be consumed, but with a peak demand 60% higher than today's, establishing requirements for generation capacity and storage.

"With improved cookstoves (ICs) increasingly distributed to households for a range of air pollution interventions and carbon-credit programs, it has become necessary to accurately monitor the duration of cooking and the amount of fuel consumed. In this study, laboratory trials were used to create temperature-based algorithms for quantifying cooking duration and estimating fuel consumption from stove temperatures. Field validation of the algorithms employed a Wireless Cookstove Sensing System (WiCS) that offers remote, low-cost temperature sensing and the wireless transmission of temperature data to a centralized database using local cellular networks. Field trials included 68 unscripted household cooking events. In the laboratory, temperature responses of the IC body and that of a removable temperature probe (J-bar) followed well-known physical models during cooking, indicating that location of the temperature sensor is not critical. In the laboratory, the classification correctly identified active cooking 97.2% of the time. In the field, the cooking duration was not statistically different from that recorded by trained volunteers; the average difference between calculated and observed cooking times was 0.03 ± 0.31 h (mean ± SD). In the laboratory, energy flux from the IC was calculated using temperatures measured by the J-bar and on the IC body and found to be proportional to the total energy in the consumed fuel, with an r2 correlation value of 0.95. In the field, the average fuel consumption was calculated to be 0.97 ± 0.32 kg compared to that recorded by volunteers of 1.19 ± 0.37 kg with an average difference between calculated and observed fuel mass of 0.21 ± 0.37 kg per event. Despite wide variation in observed cooking duration and fuel consumption per event, a relatively constant rate of fuel consumption of 0.48 kg h− 1 was calculated for users of the same type of IC.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"This paper is concerned with the process of switching from non-renewable LPG to renewable biomethane for domestic cooking in Thailand. Most domestic stoves in Thailand use liquid petroleum gas (LPG), supplied in portable tanks. Switching to biomethane requires a method of (a) biomethane production, (b) biomethane storage and (c) stove modification to allow biomethane combustion. This paper will outline a solution to each of these three hurdles. A production plant was developed, a storage and delivery solution was designed and a methodology was developed and implemented for converting stoves for biomethane use. The results show that biomethane can be produced, delivered and combusted safely and efficiently in domestic Thai stoves.

"This work compares the performance of two lignin extraction methods applied to several crops grown in Brazil and contributes to identify the biomass with more potential for generation of thermal energy from the point of view of its lignin content and properties. A full factorial (22) design involving two particle size distribution (105 to 500 μm and 1000 to 2000 μm) and two extraction methods (Klason and Wilstatter) were chosen as controlled factors for the tests, including the determination of granulometry, extractives and holocelluloses, higher heating values, and the proximate and ultimate analysis. Results showed that lignins obtained utilizing both methods have elevated higher heating values, suggesting they could generate thermal energy from thermochemical processes, mainly those lignins extracted from the Klason method. Even though the tendency for obtaining more lignin yield by using the Klason extraction method and fine particles was observed for almost all raw material tested, the statistical analysis suggested that for the experimental range studied the extraction method and the particle size distribution do not affect the lignin yields at 95% of confidence level (p-value < 0.05), except the lignin yield obtained from sugarcane bagasse. For this biomass, the extraction method chosen led to relevant differences in the lignin yield (22.6% by using Willstatter to 24.9% by using Klason), suggesting that the lower pH level used by the Klason method promotes a more efficient lignin extraction.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"The English (and Welsh) wine production industry, with more than 120 wineries, has many challenges linked to its northerly cool climate conditions and youthful status as a quality wine-producing country. The subject of sustainability remains important for producers, particularly as a means of improving the economic viability of wine production.This paper presents energy usage within English winemaking facilities based upon energy audits conducted at an individual winery level. The survey did not include vineyard operations or energy usage. The wineries surveyed were representative of the geographic distribution of producers in England and included a range of production scales from a few thousand bottles per year to over 300,000 bottles per year. The combined (average yearly) bottle production for the wineries surveyed was 1,032,194 bottles, representing almost 26% of the total wine production capacity in England and Wales, expending 512,350 kWh of energy. Almost 44% of the energy expended in English wine production is related to heating, cooling and ventilation (HVAC) requirements, with 22% related to lighting. Extrapolating the study findings to the entire English winemaking industry (winery only) indicates that 2008 MWh of energy was expended in 2011.

"Ensuring financial viability for a decentralized renewable energy project and still setting tariffs within the affordability of the users in remote areas with low income is a major challenge. Many decentralized rural electrification projects suffer from financial shortage during operation partly due to lack of tariff revenue. However, if tariff is set beyond reasonable level, it would limit the number of beneficiaries of the project. This study proposes, by taking tariff level as a parameter, a design method that seeks balance between financial viability and affordability. Through the proposed method, relationship among design parameters such as tariff, number of consumers, system cost, revenue projection, degree of cost recovery, and required government subsidy, are identified in a quantitative manner. The design method is further demonstrated by its application to a sample project site in India. As a result, the optimal tariff level is identified in terms of the degree of cost recovery. However, taking into consideration affordability, another option of lower tariff is also possible as far as government subsidy is available to cover shortfalls. Policy makers need to decide tariff setting which would resolve the trade-off to the extent possible by taking into account availability of government subsidy.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"To assess the effects of stove design and fuel type on efficiency and emissions, five configurations of natural-draft, top-lit up-draft (TLUD) semi-gasifier cookstoves were tested with two biomass fuels.  An energy balance model was developed using measured temperature data to identify the major sources of efficiency loss.  Emissions and efficiency varied substantially with stove design and fuel type, and transient increases in CO emission correlated with refueling.  The highest measured thermal efficiency was 42%.  The lowest CO and PM emissions were 0.6 g MJd− 1 and 48 g MJd− 1. These results fall within Tier 3 for high-power efficiency and emissions and suggest that development of a Tier 4 natural-draft semi-gasifier cookstove is possible. The energy balance illustrates that up to 60% of the energy input as fuel can remain as char once the fuel has gasified. This result suggests that both thermal and overall efficiencies should be calculated when evaluating TLUD cookstoves.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"The aim of this work is to investigate a two-step homogenous catalyzed waste lard transesterification reaction for low cost biodiesel production. For this purpose, two 23 full factorial design of experiments was applied. Six variables, namely esterification time (60–120 min), H2SO4 concentration (20–40 wt.%), MeOH:FFA (15:1–23:1), transesterification time (30–60 min), KOH concentration (1–2 wt.%), and MeOH:triglycerides (6:1–9:1), that typically affect the production process were studied. The esterification step is significantly affected mostly by the reaction time and the MeOH:FFA ratio value. Specifically, their increase brings a reduction of the FFA acidity. Likewise, the transesterification step is positively affected primarily by three independent variables, namely reaction time, KOH concentration and MeOH:triglyceride ratio. Furthermore two empirical models describing evolution of the two-step transesterification reaction were developed. They can become useful tools for further scaling-up the process by predicting its reaction yield within a 95% of confidence level.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"The adoption of geothermal energy in space conditioning of buildings through utilizing ground source heat pump (GSHP, also known as geothermal heat pump) has increased rapidly during the past several decades. However, one problem in operating GSHPs is that collection or rejection heat from the ground alters the ground temperature, which can adversely affect the coefficient of performance (COP). In turn, the amount of heat that must be exchanged with the ground increases in order to satisfy a given heating or cooling load. This paper presents a novel model to calculate the soil temperature distribution and the COP of GSHP. Different scenarios were simulated to quantify the impact of different factors on the GSHP performance, including seasonal balance between heat collection and heat rejection, daily running mode, and spacing between boreholes. Our results show that greater loads and smaller distances between boreholes cause changes in soil temperature large enough to adversely affect the GSHP performance, even resulting in COPs less than those commonly achieved with air source heat pumps. However, shifting from heating to cooling on a seasonal basis can, in part, mitigate this problem. Long boreholes, additional space between boreholes and intermittent running mode could also improve the performance of GSHP, but large initial investment is required.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26

Based on national population census data, this research evaluates the current situation and long-term trend of solid fuel use for cooking in rural China. Firstly, over three-fourths of all rural households depend on solid fuels to meet their cooking demand, while in urban area and township this figure is as low as 8% and 36% respectively. Secondly, solid fuel use was linked closely to rural household income, i.e., those regions with low per capita household income use more solid fuel. Furthermore, the proportion of rural households using solid fuel declined 17 percentage points in 2000-2010, albeit with some significant regional differences. Finally, the proportion of rural residents using clean fuels remained low, and the proportion using gas remained nearly constant over last 10 years in many provinces.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"A multifunctional platform (MFP) is a building containing electrical generating system and a variety of electricity consuming devices selected to serve the specific needs of rural villages. Commonly, in West Africa, the generating system consists of a diesel engine and batteries. Typical loads include grain mills and de-hulling. In Mauritania, the generating systems commonly include only photovoltaic generating systems and batteries. We visited 14 such MFPs and interviewed users and representatives of organizations that have sponsored the systems. Major benefits of the MFPs include creation of jobs, resulting in better incomes for population, and time saved by women in the traditional processing of cereals. Major problems we noticed include low maintenance and without control of some MFPs.

"The floating population in China is a large and special group that works in modern cities but cannot enjoy the same welfare benefits as local households due to the population registration system. Their energy consumption patterns may differ considerably from local urban households and their rural family members. Hence, the present paper studies the effects of household characteristics on energy spending by data collected from a survey of floating population in Shanghai. We concluded that several characteristics of floating population are important factors to explain their energy spending and consumption patterns. We found that the effect of income on energy spending is different from the effect of total household expenditure even though positive relations are observed between income and total expenditure of a household. Household size is another key variable for total energy spending, electricity spending, and gas spending but not for oil spending. Instead, number of motor vehicles is a key variable for oil spending. Finally location of a household in the downtown generally implies less energy spending (mainly oil). However, no clear evidence supports this for electricity and gas spending.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"Ventilation is essential to maintaining a healthy indoor environment. However, during the summer and winter seasons, the temperature of the outdoor air can be so extreme that providing adequate ventilation requires a significant amount of energy. Consequently, an energy-efficient ventilation system is important for minimizing energy consumption. The thermal labyrinth is a ventilation system that pulls in outdoor air through an underground labyrinth-shaped concrete structure that is part of the building itself. Through heat exchange with the ground, this system can pre-cool and pre-heat the outdoor air in the summer and winter seasons, respectively. The goal of this study was to evaluate the energy performance of the thermal labyrinth ventilation system (TLVS) used in the Ewha Campus Center building recently built in Seoul, South Korea. By using the TLVS, the peak loads for the cooling and dehumidification and the heating and humidification of the outdoor air were found to be reduced by 47.6% and 41.2%, respectively.

"Directional wave measurements were carried out at two different near-shore locations in the Fiji islands with the help of an underwater pressure transducer — a Directional Wave Recorder. The primary site which is located in the west of the main island in Fiji has a moderate energy potential of 9.81 kW/m at a depth of 15 m. The second site which was the focus of past wave energy measurements was also studied and the new data along with previous measurements show high energy potential at this location. This site near Kadavu Island has a near-shore energy flux of around 28.78 kW/m at a depth of 18 m. The directional spread of the waves and the nature of their occurrence are presented.

"In fifteen years, South Korea went from providing only 12% of rural households with electricity to providing 98% of rural households with electricity for lighting and productive uses. This paper provides an analysis of rural electrification and development in South Korea from 1965 to 1979 and finds that rural electrification contributed to a significant increase in rural household income levels and improved the quality of life in villages substantially. At the same time, rural electrification did not benefit the poorest quartile of rural households, increased economic and social inequality, led to a significant increase in household debt, and accelerated migration to urban areas. Central to the South Korean electrification experience was a top-down and a bottom-up approach that balanced local control and participation with central government control. This approach was crucial in overcoming many of the issues that continue to be found today in both grid-based and off-grid approaches to electrification.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"This paper aims to analyse energy related properties, thermal degradation behaviour and devolatilization kinetics of five Cameroonian biomasses namely, Palm Kernel Shells (PKS), Mesocarp Fibres (PMF), Coffee Husk (CH), Corn Cob (CC) and Peanut Shell (PNS). The thermal degradation was performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TG). Different behaviours related to the presence of chemical constituents such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were obtained. Comparison of the thermal characterization shows that PMF is the most interesting feedstock with the highest heating values and reactivity due to higher volatile content. Decomposition of TG data was analysed by applying diffusion and chemical reaction kinetic models. Obtained results show that biomass pyrolysis is represented by two successive steps. The devolatilization stage characterized by high weight loss rate is well described by diffusion reaction models. In contrast, the char formation stage characterized by low weight loss rate is well described by third order chemical reaction models.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"Decarbonising the UK electricity mix is vital to achieving the national target of 80% reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, relative to a 1990 baseline. Much work so far has focused only on costs and GHG emissions ignoring other sustainability issues. This paper goes beyond to assess the life cycle sustainability of different electricity scenarios for the UK, extending to 2070. The scenarios include the main technologies relevant to the UK: nuclear, gas, coal with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS), wind, solar photovoltaics and biomass. Three levels of decarbonisation are considered and the implications are assessed for techno-economic, environmental and social impacts on a life cycle basis. The results show that decarbonisation is likely to increase electricity costs despite anticipated future cost reductions for immature technologies. Conversely, sensitivity to volatile fuel prices decreases by two-thirds in all the scenarios with low-carbon technologies. To meet the GHG emission targets, coal CCS can only play a limited role, contributing 10% to the electricity mix at most; the use of CCS also increases other sustainability impacts compared to today, including worker injuries, large accident fatalities, depletion of fossil fuels and long-term waste storage. This calls into question the case for investing in coal CCS. A very low-carbon mix with nuclear and renewables provides the best overall environmental performance, but some impacts increase, such as terrestrial eco-toxicity. Such a mix also worsens some social issues such as health impacts from radiation and radioactive waste storage requirements. UK-based employment may more than double by 2070 if a renewables-intensive mix is chosen. However, the same mix also increases depletion of elements nearly seven-fold relative to the present, emphasising the need for end-of-life recycling. Very low-carbon mixes also introduce considerable uncertainty due to low dispatchability and grid instability. With equal weighting assumed for each sustainability impact, the scenario with an equal share of nuclear and renewables is ranked best.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"The financial viability of biodiesel production from Jatropha is estimated under real-life African conditions. The assessment is modelled from the data of an oil producer with a social entrepreneurial business model in Tanzania. A first-round cost analysis shows that the total cost of biodiesel production including all company costs and taxes is significantly higher than Tanzanian and typical East-African market prices for diesel; however, when by-products are utilised as additional sources of revenue, biodiesel production is projected to become financially viable. While these findings are far removed from the recently hyped expectations surrounding Jatropha as an energy crop, they also do not lend support to the current widespread discrediting of Jatropha bio-energy. We conclude that Jatropha biodiesel production in SubSaharan Africa can be financially viable and socially benign, but only under certain conditions.

"This study seeks to assess the potential of utilizing Concentrated Solar Power for electricity generation in Zimbabwe. Data from 26 meteorological stations which are widely distributed around the country was used to map the distribution of solar radiation. Geographic information systems were employed to locate sites with potential for installing concentrating solar power plants. Areas with good potential were identified by using the following assessment factors: direct normal irradiance (DNI), proximity to transmission lines and water bodies, flatness of the area and the vulnerability of vegetation and wild life. After considering all the assessment factors, a total area of 250 000 km2 was found to be suitable. If only 10% of the suitable land area is used and the technology with the least efficiency (8–10%) is adopted, about 71.4 GW can be generated.

"Merging climate change mitigation and sustainable development in developing countries is pivotal for the transition towards low carbon growth pathways. This paper combines the field of technology transfer and technology-specific aspects with sustainable development objectives.The general climate change mitigation paradigm has shifted from project oriented mitigation action to more strategic, country-wide, cross-sectoral mitigation plans, in order to explicitly take into account also economic development goals.Local technology needs and socio-technical circumstances are important towards economic development induced by technology transfer. Yet, this approach is not sufficient for the success of technology transfer, which shall also deliver on economic development. A strategy for the adoption of technologies, as well as the broadening of the domestic technology manufacturing base, needs to consider also the technology properties itself in greater detail. The technology transfer process should emphasize the economic developmental purpose as well as the properties of technologies. Thus, I propose a detailed assessment of the technology and its potential of being adopted by suggesting that technology complexity assessments should be integrated into technology transfer mechanisms. By using CSP, PV and wind technology as examples, I describe how the evaluation of technology complexity and of potential economic development, determined by demand for manufactured goods and services within domestic economies, which could lead to job creation and value added, could be used to inform policy makers.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"Spain is the first olive oil maker worldwide. Yearly, the olive oil industry generates large amounts of by-products: olive pomace, tree pruning, pits, leaves and branches. This work presents the experimental and feasibility study of a pilot plant for the conversion of olive tree pruning and olive pits into electrical and thermal power. The pilot plant is composed of a downdraft gasifier, gas cooling-cleaning stage and spark ignition engine with a modified carburetor. The experimental results showed satisfactory cold gas efficiency (in the range of 70.7–75.5%) and good lower calorific value of the producer gas for both raw materials (4.8 and 5.4 MJ kg− 1). Moreover, the plant achieved acceptable values for the electric and CHP efficiency: 15% and almost 50%, respectively. Finally, the investment achieved reasonable profitability index with a payback period of 5–6 years.

"Jatropha has been promoted in sub-Saharan Africa as a smallholder energy crop promising additional revenue and energetic self-sufficiency. In this case-study located in Southern Mali we performed a comparative life cycle assessment shedding light on the influence of smallholder participation and yield fluctuations on the global warming potential, fossil resource depletion and energy demand of Jatropha-based rural electrification in comparison to a fossil fuel-based reference. We found that the global warming potential of Jatropha-based electrification can be 13% higher to 20% lower than fossil diesel, depending on the yield. In terms of energy use and fossil fuel depletion, Jatropha is more favourable than fossil-based electricity. In either perspective, the activities related to cultivating and processing grain from small farmers accentuate the environmental impacts, owing to low yields. We conclude that outgrower engagement in tending and harvesting Jatropha is a key factor for improving the environmental performance of the system.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"Sugarcane is one of the most promising sources of green energy for a major sugar producing country like Thailand. Any efforts to improve energy efficiency in sugar industry would result for green energy production and more avoided GHG emissions. This paper assesses the potentials for energy saving and GHG emission reduction in sugar production in Thailand. It is found that there is a wide gap between the most efficient mills and the less efficient ones among the country’s 47 mills, with specific steam consumption ranging from 400 to 646 kg steam/ton cane. Thus significant potential exists for energy saving and GHG emission reduction in many mills, using some of the 17 commonly common technologies/measures identified.

"This work examines whether a chimney has influence over the combustion characteristics of biomass within a stove. Experimental work as well as a simplified chemical kinetic model suggests that a chimney plays an active role in the performance of a stove by influencing the overall air-to-fuel ratio and subsequently the production of carbon monoxide. Two different stoves, operated at multiple wood consumption rates, were shown to run with steady state excess air of 300 % − 1250 %. The wood consumption rate was found to be independent of the chimney draft for both stoves. Increasing draft was shown to increase excess air. Draft served to cool combustion gases through dilution with makeup air. Increasing excess air decreased modified combustion efficiency in experiments and kinetic modeling. Increasing the frictional loss coefficient of a chimney by decreasing the diameter was shown to reduce CO production through a reduction of excess air.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26

"Being able to access modern energy forms is acknowledged as a pre-condition for achieving sustainability and improvement of quality of life. In an urban setting, wider selection of fuels is available for use, and policy makers are increasingly faced with the challenge of anticipating energy requirements of urban population, particularly as increases in affluence often translates to moving-up on the energy ladder from traditional fuels to modern energy. Using survey data, household electricity access and consumption behaviour in Gauteng province of South Africa was analysed with respect to some household socio-economic characteristics. The survey shows that household respondents are connected to electrical supply options as follows: 57.7% prepaid card; 35.5% conventional meter; 12.8% do not have an electrical supply; 7.6% solar; 1.4% do not know their electrical supply; 0.8% diesel generators and 0.5% connection to neighbours house. However, being connected with electrical supply does not imply that the households do not make use of other dangerous and risky fuel types such as kerosene and candles for cooking and lighting respectively. Factors behind the lack of use of electricity even though households have electricity supply options include among others, income and low price for other fuels relative to electricity.",Volume 23,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/23/suppl/C,26
"One of the technological challenges in wind power is the development of a next generation of feasible upscaled turbines of cheaper construction that may further reduce generation costs. But limitations in the current blade technology constitute a technological barrier that needs to be overcome. As the size of the typical turbine increases, savings in weight and complexity in the rotor design and its auxiliary mechanisms, like the pitch-control actuators, become more important. The notion of smart or intelligent advanced blades that can control themselves and reduce (or completely eliminate) the need of an active control system is a very attractive prospect for future developments in blade technology.The idea of wind turbine rotors which automatically adapt to the meteorological and working conditions is not entirely new. It has been around for the last two or three decades, and several control systems have been proposed to achieve this goal using either a purely-passive or a combination of active-passive means. Blade adaptiveness can be achieved by means of inducing coupling among modes of deformation of the blade which are usually only slightly coupled. For instance, coupling between bending and twisting can be used to control power production, to reduce vibration and extreme loads, and to improve fatigue performance. In this case, as aerodynamic loads begin to bend the blade, flexo-torsional modes induce a twist. This changes the angle of attack on the airfoil sections, reducing the lift force acting on the blade.In this paper, we are going to review different aspects of the adaptive-blade concept development, covering a historical overview, recent advances, and future trends.","Volume 22, Pages 1-84 (October 2014)",October 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/22/suppl/C,27
"Water pumping is one of the oldest uses of wind energy with the multi-bladed, high-solidity windmill still in widespread use. In contrast to the low-solidity, high-speed blades of modern wind turbines which use airfoil profiles, windmills typically employ thin, circular-arc blades at high solidity and low speed. While there is considerable data on the aerodynamic behavior of circular arc airfoils (of zero solidity) there is very little data on cascades of circular arc blades. This paper investigates computationally the effects of solidity on the lift and drag of thin, circular arc blades in preparation for a detailed blade element analysis of windmill performance. Typical Reynolds numbers, Re, for windmills are around 105, so modeling of laminar separation and transition was expected to be as important as modeling the subsequent turbulent flow. The SST-transition model was, therefore, used. The “constants” in the transition equations were adjusted to match surface pressure measurements on circular arc airfoils at Re = 62,000, and then compared to separate measurements of the lift and drag at Re = 105. Excellent agreement was found in the former but the agreement for the latter was poorer. Computational modeling of solidity showed significant variation in the lift and drag which should be included in a blade element calculation.","Volume 22, Pages 1-84 (October 2014)",October 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/22/suppl/C,27
"Small scale and low cost hydrokinetic turbines can effectively contribute to solve energy deficits in developing countries, particularly in isolated communities, but some obstacles remain before they become a cost effective solution. This work reports on a methodology for designing and fabricating the main parts of small scale horizontal axis hydrokinetic turbines (HAHT) optimized for a specific site or operation conditions. A suitable software design tool, and low cost fabrication methods within reach and understanding of less developed communities are the basis of this methodology. A free and open source software package called Turbem developed by the authors allows a non-expert user to enter a minimum set of parameters and to obtain the complete optimal rotor geometry of the HAHT, with its estimated performance curves and maximum stresses. Turbem uses a combined approach of BEM theory and pseudo-gradient root finding for rotor optimal design, and classical solid mechanics for preliminary structural verification. The geometric information generated is sufficient for fabricating the rotor by a wide range of methods, ranging from hand carving up to CNC machining. In the latter case, Turbem generates CNC programs that are downloadable to any standard CNC machine, for direct fabrication of the blades and hub, or blade section templates as well. Hence, a technically sound rotor can be fabricated at a very low cost using wood as core and applying external layups of fiberglass with epoxy resin, as described herein. Using this methodology, small scale, cost effective HAHTs can be custom designed to take full advantage of specific site stream velocities and bathymetry. A 5 kW (nominal) hydrokinetic turbine was successfully designed, fabricated and field tested in order to validate and improve this methodology.","Volume 22, Pages 1-84 (October 2014)",October 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/22/suppl/C,27
"Due to technological advancement, availability of multi-megawatt wind turbines, ease of installation and maintenance, economic compatibility and commercial acceptance, wind power is being used globally for both grid-connected and off-grid applications. The wind power is intermittently available due to the fluctuating nature of the wind and hence needs to be understood well. Its variability was studied in this paper both in time and spatial domain. The present work utilized daily mean values of wind speed from different meteorological stations spread over the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in conjunction with wavelet transform and fast Fourier transform power spectrum techniques to understand the dynamic nature of the wind at nine stations. The study found that wind speed changed by ± 0.6 to ± 1.6 knots over a long period of about 10 years depending on the locations. The long-term mean wind speed of 5.6, 8.9, 6.25, 8.1, 6.0, 7.1, 6.0, 8.6 and 7.3 knots was obtained at Abha, Dhahran, Gizan, Guriat, Hail, Jeddah, Riyadh, Turaif and Yanbu, respectively.","Volume 22, Pages 1-84 (October 2014)",October 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/22/suppl/C,27
"We analyze the wind velocity, v(t), at a location in the Patagonia, Argentina, as a function of time, measured every 10 min, uninterruptedly, over a one-year period, by taking the graph (t, v(t)) as a signal, and applying the tools of multifractal analysis. The multifractal spectrum (α, f(α)) of this signal, obtained by the definition of α and f(α), is strangely smooth, for it fulfills all properties of the twice-differentiable thermodynamical formalism, the theoretical algorithm devised to mimic the spectrum-by-definition (with which it may not coincide, since the latter may not even be continuous). We give arguments to conclude that the wind-spectrum is of Weierstrass type. We take a finite sample of Weierstrass functions, Wλ,s(t), at regular intervals Δt, the size of each sample comparable to that of the wind signal. We take these samples as signals, and construct their multifractal spectra by definition, for different parametric values of λ and s. We compare the different Weierstrass spectra with the wind spectrum, and obtain information on the Weierstrass parametric values that agree with the wind spectrum. We interpret the key points of the wind spectrum in meteorological terms. Any change, from one year to the next, in the position of such key points, or in the shape of the spectral curve—once interpreted in the corresponding meteorological terms—could be some local indicator of climate change.","Volume 22, Pages 1-84 (October 2014)",October 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/22/suppl/C,27
"The island of Fuerteventura, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in the Atlantic Ocean, aims to develop renewable energy sources, in particular wave and offshore wind energy, to reduce its carbon footprint. In this context, the objectives of this work are: (i) to assess the wave and offshore wind resources around the island; and (ii) to determine the area or areas that are best suited for their exploitation, taking into account the resource assessment and other conditioning factors such as the bathymetry, distance to the coastline and ports, and offshore zoning prescribed by the authorities. To accomplish these objectives, hindcast wave and wind data obtained with numerical models are used alongside observations from meteorological stations. We identify two areas as having great potential for offshore wind farms; one of them is also very promising for a combined wave–wind farm (or a wave farm on its own). We characterise in detail the wind resource in both areas, and the wave resource in the latter: the wind resource, in terms of directions and velocities; and the wave resource, in terms of directions, significant wave heights and energy periods. In the case of the wind resource, most of the energy corresponds to NNE and NE winds with velocities between 8 and 14 m s− 1, which should be taken into account when selecting the offshore wind turbines. As for the wave resource, we find that most of the annual wave energy is provided by N and NNW waves with significant wave heights between 1.5 m and 3.0 m and energy periods between 10.5 s and 13.5 s. It follows that the Wave Energy Converters deployed in the area should have maximum efficiency in those ranges. In sum, Fuerteventura has a substantial wave and offshore wind resource, which is assessed in this work; two areas for their exploitation are proposed, and the ranges of wave and wind conditions for which the wave energy converters and offshore wind turbines to be installed should have maximum efficiency are determined.","Volume 22, Pages 1-84 (October 2014)",October 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/22/suppl/C,27

Using a functional unit of producing 50 kWh per month for 20 years, a Life Cycle Assessment was conducted comparing the global warming potential (GWP100), embodied energy, energy payback period (EPP) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of four small wind turbines (≤ 20 kW), a diesel generator, and the Thai grid. The turbines had a lower overall GWP100 compared to the diesel generator and Thai grid in areas with reasonable wind resources; the same was true for embodied energy when compared to the diesel generator. Interestingly, in most available wind speed categories in Thailand the LCOE for wind turbines was lower than for the diesel generator. However, neither could compare to the selling price of the Thai grid, except in the areas with the highest average wind speeds (7.0–9.4 m/s). Because of the increased cost relative to the Thai grid, implementation of wind turbines in Thailand was not found to be economically feasible without government incentive.","Volume 22, Pages 1-84 (October 2014)",October 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/22/suppl/C,27

"To maximize uptake of micro renewable-energy generation, specifically small wind-turbines, it is crucial to permit for tower heights which allow maximum utilization of the available wind resource. Within New Zealand, municipal governments have authority to place limitations on the height of built structures in rural areas, including wind turbines.Numerical simulations using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are used to examine the effects of simple house shapes and heights on the characteristics of the air flow reaching wind turbines. Within New Zealand, municipal governments have authority to place limitations on the height of built structures in rural areas, including wind turbines. However at present they have insufficient information to understand which height limitations may decrease wind-resource utilisation by small wind-turbines installed in these areas. This research finds that current permitted structure heights are not sufficiently high, necessitating either lengthy planning consent processes or acceptance of sub-optimal turbine output. Municipal councils in New Zealand could reduce barriers to small wind-turbine installations by considering taller towers, in the 15–20 m range, acceptable. This 15–20 m range is transferrable to all rural areas, in other developed or developing countries, where a lone small turbine or small number of small wind-turbines are being considered for installation near dwellings.",Volume 21,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/21/suppl/C,28

"Power output fluctuations have a potentially negative effect on utility grid stability, especially in isolated power systems such as that of Israel. Thus for the successful large scale application of photovoltaic power (PV) in an isolated system it is of particular importance to have a proper selection of photovoltaic sites together with an appropriate distribution of installed power.The Negev desert in Israel is an ideal location for utility scale PV plants, where the average annual global horizontal radiation is above 2000 [kWh ∗ m− 2 ∗ year− 1]. In spite of the 10% goal of renewably energy production by year 2020, in 2013 less than 1% of Israel's electric energy needs are supplied by PV and now is the best time to propose a proper spatial distribution of PV fleet in Negev that will limit the extreme fluctuations originated from the fleet without significantly reducing the utilized solar energy.This paper presents a method of comparing different PV development scenarios by ranking them according to expected power fluctuations.The irradiation fluctuation rank formulated in this paper was calculated using data of global irradiation measured during one and a half year with a 1 minute sampling time on seven sites in Israel's Negev desert. This rank values were compared for a large number of different possible geographical distributions of PV power plants.Results show that the rank decreases with distribution of the same PV power over an increasing number of sites. The rank shows similar trends for the period of a year as well as for different seasons. Allocating PV power with different weights between a fixed number of sites influences the number of extreme power fluctuations. The PV fleet configuration with the minimum rank value shows the minimum number of extreme power fluctuations that will affect system frequency.",Volume 21,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/21/suppl/C,28
"Many of the 12 to 33 million artisanal (“small scale”) fishers in the developing world work at night using energy-intensive kerosene lanterns to attract fish to their nets. In Tanzania—where 100,000 such fishers operate, spending US$70 million per year on lighting—we identified current practices and conducted user-centered field tests of LED-based system usability, performance and energy savings potential, and estimated the market size for today's fuel-based lighting. Fishers in the areas we studied spend 35% to 50% of their take-home pay on lighting equipment and fuel. Due to the combination of higher intensity pressurized lanterns, and longer operating hours, Tanzanian fishers use as much lighting fuel as would about 1 million ordinary household lanterns. We found that similar catches could be obtained with battery-powered LED lighting systems, with a simple payback time for the LED system investment of three to four months. The fishers we interviewed were almost universally pleased with the concept behind the lights used in the field tests, and eager to purchase them provided the right price and performance. However none of the LED systems we tested were adequate for this use. Essential product modifications include improved durability and performance in harsh fishing environments. Independent testing and certification would encourage product quality and support consumer confidence as they adopt these highly beneficial new technologies. Our results provide a roadmap for product manufacturers and others interested in deployment, with an overnight-conversion market size of US$17 to US$21 million in Tanzania alone, plus US$6 to US$7 million per year in ongoing replacement expenditures. This potential could well justify retooling and marketing investment on the part of lighting manufacturers.",Volume 21,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/21/suppl/C,28
"Two Brazilian biomass samples, namely sugarcane trash and Eucalyptus benthamii were evaluated as feedstocks for liquid and solid fuels production by fast pyrolysis, using a fluidized bed reactor and two different sets of process conditions. In the first, an inert gas (N2) was used as a fluidizing agent while in the second, a mixture of N2 and recycled pyrolysis effluent gas, mainly CO, CO2, H2 and light hydrocarbons, was used as the fluidizing agent and to also create a reducing reaction atmosphere for the process. Comparing both processes, the reducing atmosphere had a significant deoxygenation effect on the pyrolysis oil from the two feedstocks, improving the quality and stability of the oils by reducing water, total acid number (TAN), viscosity, and increasing the higher heating value (HHV). For both feedstocks, reduced amounts of acetic acid, acetol and levoglucosan, and increased amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons not initially present in the traditional bio-oil were observed for the organic fraction of the bio-oil. However, there was a reduction of 13.5 wt% (db) in the bio-oil yield from E. benthamii when a reactive atmosphere was used. Comparing both feedstocks, the eucalyptus yielded on the average, 50% more bio-oil than the sugarcane trash while the trash yielded 50% more permanent gas. Apart from the high ash content associated with biochar from sugarcane trash, biochar produced from both feedstock samples had similarities with bituminous coal in terms of moisture content, fixed carbon content, and heating values.",Volume 21,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/21/suppl/C,28
"Household air pollution (HAP) from use of solid fuels varies greatly depending on stove technology, fuel, housing characteristics, season, and geographical area. Accurate information about indoor air pollution concentration as well as personal exposure is vital for more precise estimates of the health burden from HAP. We measured indoor fine particles ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations for 48 h in 179 homes in winter and 122 homes in summer in rural Guizhou, China. Furthermore, we measured personal CO exposure among 1796 women. The highest median [25th–75th percentiles] PM2.5 kitchen concentrations were found in winter in biomass homes with an open fire (557 [303–882] μg/m3) or a stove without chimney (533 [210–770] μg/m3), while homes with a chimney stove had lower median kitchen concentrations (337 [212–1114] μg/m3 and 371 [192–1208] μg/m3 for biomass and coal, respectively). There was large seasonal variability with lower concentrations in summer for both PM2.5 and CO. Indoor CO concentrations were more correlated with type of fuel than stove technology, with higher median winter concentrations in kitchens using biomass (2.4 [0.9–4.6] ppm) than coal (0.7 [0.6–1.5] ppm). Personal CO exposure was relatively low, with median 1.3 [0.9–2.1] ppm. Stove and fuel type, ventilation, kitchen configuration, occupation, secondhand tobacco smoke, time spent outdoors, and ambient temperature were all associated with personal CO exposure. We found that CO could not be used as a suitable proxy for PM2.5 in this setting due to large heterogeneity in stove and fuel use within homes. We also found only a weak correlation between personal and indoor measurements, highlighting the importance of doing personal measurements in epidemiological research. Most households exceeded the PM10 Chinese indoor air pollution standard of 150 μg/m3. Hence, continued efforts are needed to mitigate health damaging levels of HAP.",Volume 21,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/21/suppl/C,28
"As the dissemination of improved biomass cookstoves is an ongoing activity, studying the parameters that affect stove performance is important. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of moisture content (MC) in fuel on stove performance. Wood pellets with MC of 5.9%, 9.4%, 18.2%, and 22.1% were processed and used as fuel in the test. A natural-draft semi-gasified cookstove was employed in this study. Two methods of thermal efficiency calculations were adopted in this study and the results were compared. It was observed that the burning rate, cooking power, and CO and PM2.5 emission factors all decreased with the increase of MC in fuel, and the impacts were all statistically significant (p < 0.05), while the ratio of quantity of charcoal produced to the quantity of dry fuel stayed at around 26%–27%. The results obtained in this study provided us useful information on the effects of MC in fuel on the performance of a semi-gasified cookstove in the lab and in the field.",Volume 21,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/21/suppl/C,28
"Based on a survey of 3000 households, covering both authorized and informal connections to electricity, the paper examines the key drivers of the demand for regulated electricity service in 4 slums of Mumbai. The methodology builds on the typical slum context, where informal connections are easily obtained and widespread. WTP for safe, authorized electricity provision is estimated through both “stated” preferences and “revealed” ones extrapolated from present electricity demand. WTP estimates are further validated using propensity score matching. The comparative analysis confirms that affordability (of both the initial investment and the increased consumption fees) is a primary barrier to regularization. Additionally, lack of house ownership status or address proof, precarious house construction and, possibly, pressure from local leaders all play an important role in choosing an electricity supplier. Policies to reduce the prevalence of informal connections should also address contextual issues like the intricacy of Mumbai's governance and social exclusion.",Volume 21,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/21/suppl/C,28
"The study was carried out to compare the cookstove performance using Water Boiling Test (WBT) and the Indian Standard on Solid Biomass Chulha Specification developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for testing cookstove. Additionally, the testing guidelines pertaining to feeding interval and ignition material were also tested in the BIS and WBT, respectively. Two cookstoves manufactured by Phillips, Philips Natural Draft (PN) and Philips Forced Draft (PF) were selected for assessing their performance. The thermal efficiency (TE), emission factors (EFs) of carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) were used as performance indicators to compare the cookstove performance. It was observed that both the cookstoves gave comparable TE with no significant difference (p > 0.05) using both protocols; whereas, CO EFs were ~ 39% and ~ 47% higher in BIS test due to dominance of smoldering conditions compared to WBT in PF and PN cookstoves, respectively. On the contrary, PM emissions were found to be ~ 55% lower in BIS test compared to WBT in PN cookstove, which could be due to the oven dried wood recommended in the BIS test. Inclusion of emissions of ignition phase was found to increase the total PM and CO emissions during cold start by 45–70% when mustard stalks were used as kindling material compared to wood chips and kerosene. Average CO emissions were found to increase by ~ 68% and ~ 48% in PF and PN cookstoves, respectively, with 15 minute fuel feeding interval in BIS test. The result shows that change in combustion conditions during the two different test protocols did not affect the energy parameters; however, the effect on CO and PM emissions was significant. It can be concluded that multiple testing methods might yield different information of cookstove performance leading to difficulty in assessing the actual performance of cookstoves.",Volume 21,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/21/suppl/C,28
"The Indian economy struggles with electricity supply deficits and low quality supply. Although several initiatives including demand side management measures have already been implemented, consumers from different backgrounds suffer from various drawbacks of quality supply. This paper explores the valuation of electricity quality from the perspective of domestic consumers in Hyderabad, India. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with 798 urban households. For analysis, we apply a scale-adjusted latent class model to identify heterogeneity in preferences and in variance-scale. The results confirm the hypothesis of highly heterogeneous household preferences and reveal limited preparedness of domestic users to pay for improved electricity quality and renewable energy. Further, most respondents prefer state owned distribution companies to private enterprises or cooperative societies. We argue that the estimated preferences, implying demand and willingness to pay for single attributes of electricity quality, can help policy makers to adequately incorporate consumers' interests into decision making. The results further indicate that domestic tariff hikes should not be used to finance extension of renewable energies or infrastructure investment to improve reliability in supply.",Volume 21,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/21/suppl/C,28
"Bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of Tunisian almond shell (TN-AS) in fluidized bed reactor was investigated. TG (Thermogravimetric) and DTG (Derivative Thermogravimetric) analyses were performed to quantify the kinetic of its thermal degradation by comparison with other Mediterranean almond shell feedstocks from Spain (SP-AS) and Turkey (TR-AS).The obtained bio-oil was characterized in terms of its composition and energy content using FTIR, 13C NMR and GC-MS. The analyses showed that TN-AS bio-oil was similar to the Turkish one and was slightly different from the Spanish bio-oil.Aging effect at room temperature over a long storage period (5 years) was also investigated to assess bio-oil stability. The aged TN-AS bio-oil had a higher viscosity (705.16 ± 3.76 mm2·s− 1 at 50 °C) while pH, water content and HHV remained unchanged. The increase of viscosity may be due to the increase in the molecular weight resulting of re-polymerization reactions taking place during the long storage period.",Volume 21,August 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/21/suppl/C,28
"A novel off-grid electricity-producing device has been designed for integration with biomass-fuelled improved cooking stoves commonly in use in the developing world. The device operates on the thermoelectric principle whereby small amounts of electricity can be produced in response to a temperature difference across a thermoelectric generator, or TEG. The energy produced by the integrated generator can be used for direct charging or stored in a rechargeable lithium–iron-phosphate (LiFePo4) battery. The generator is equipped with a standard USB output which allows the user to charge a variety of 5 Volt appliances. Five technology demonstrator electricity generating stoves have been integrated with locally produced clay cooking stoves in the Balaka District of Malawi, Africa. This study details the results from an 80-day field trial of the devices. The data reveals that the stoves are in use for a greater time than was anticipated. The data also indicates that the generators perform adequately in the field and provide the user with the ability to charge LED lights and mobile phones from the generator stoves every day if necessary.",Volume 20,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/20/suppl/C,29
"It is clear that renewable energy plays a crucial role in achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents a model approach of CO2 emissions in Ecuador in the upcoming years, up to 2020. The main goal of this work is to study in detail the way the changes in the energy matrix and in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will affect the CO2 emissions of the country. In particular, we will pay special attention to the effect of a reduction of the share of fossil energy, as well as of an improvement in the efficiency of the fossil energy use. We have developed a system dynamics model based on a relationship, which is a variation of the Kaya identity, and on a GDP that depends on renewable energy, which introduces a feedback mechanism in the model. The main conclusion is that it is possible to control the CO2 emissions even under a scenario of continuous increase of the GDP, if it is combined with an increase of the use of renewable energy, with an improvement of the productive sectoral structure and with the use of a more efficient fossil fuel technology. This study offers useful lessons for developing countries, and it could be used as a policy-making tool because it is easily transferable to any other time period or region.",Volume 20,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/20/suppl/C,29
"Almost half of the world's population still cooks on biomass cookstoves of poor efficiency and primitive design, such as three stone fires (TSF). Emissions from biomass cookstoves contribute to adverse health effects and climate change. A number of improved cookstoves with higher energy efficiency and lower emissions have been designed and promoted across the world. During the design development, and for the selection of a stove for dissemination, the stove performance and emissions are commonly evaluated, communicated and compared using the arithmetic average of replicate tests made using a standardized laboratory-based test, commonly the water boiling test (WBT). However, the statistics section of the test protocol contains some debatable concepts and in certain cases, easily misinterpreted recommendations. Also, there is no agreement in the literature on how many replicate tests should be performed to ensure “confidence” in the reported average performance (with three being the most common number of replicates). This matter has not received sufficient attention in the rapidly growing literature on stoves, and yet is crucial for estimating and communicating the performance of a stove, and for comparing the performance between stoves. We illustrate an application using data from a number of replicate tests of performance and emission of the Berkeley–Darfur Stove (BDS) and the TSF under well-controlled laboratory conditions. Here we focus on two as illustrative: time-to-boil and emissions of PM2.5 (particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 μm in diameter). We demonstrate that an interpretation of the results comparing these stoves could be misleading if only a small number of replicates had been conducted. We then describe a practical approach, useful to both stove testers and designers, to assess the number of replicates needed to obtain useful data from previously untested stoves with unknown variability.",Volume 20,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/20/suppl/C,29
"Rural household access to clean and affordable modern energy is critical to improving living standards in developing countries. Rural households in northern Nigeria in particular, are almost entirely dependent on fuelwood for their basic cooking needs. This has adverse effects on households' health, their productivity and environmental degradation. This paper analyzes the effect of households' socio-economic characteristics on choice of cooking fuel. A multinomial logit (MNL) model was used to estimate the determinants of fuel choice in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Nigeria. Data analysis shows that the patterns of fuel usage are consistent with the ‘energy stacking’ theory as fuelwood are often used alongside modern fuels, and majority of the households depend largely on fuelwood as its principal cooking fuel. Modern fuels thus have failed to displace traditional fuelwood. Empirical results of MNL model shows that household head's age, educational attainment, household size, income, type of dwelling unit, the duration of food cooked and price of fuelwood are statistically significant factors influencing households' choice of cooking fuel. Implications for regional and national fuel policies are discussed.",Volume 20,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/20/suppl/C,29

We use this critical juncture – where program priorities and strategies are formalized and converted into institutional norms and practices – to review current debates and areas for future research. We focus our review on four important areas and suggest industry participants expand and refine efforts to (i) balance technical stove performance with implementation needs and stove user compatibility; (ii) understand the trade-offs associated with local and imported production methods; (iii) determine a suitable role for direct subsidies for purchasing stoves and indirect subsidies for research, institutional development and distribution of stoves; and (iv) develop an appropriate finance strategy to support dissemination amidst carbon market uncertainties.

"Access to energy is a condition for economic development and for a better way of life. The Brazilian Amazon region has some challenges regarding the electrification of small rural populations, since there are some restrictions to extending the grid to all villages. In order to discover how electricity has changed the life of the Amazonian riverine population, two communities were selected: one was partially electrified by Solar Home Systems (SHS) and the other was almost totally electrified by grid extension. In both communities, questionnaires were applied, with questions related to electricity consumption patterns in residential and productive activities and complementary energy sources, as well as open questions about electricity access impacts. In both communities, impacts were positive mainly due to a reduction in complementary energy source consumption. However, people with electricity supplied by grid described a greater impact in terms of their productive activities because of the higher electricity supply.",Volume 20,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/20/suppl/C,29

The main objective is to obtain conclusions on the best possible formulation of the multi-criteria decision-making problem related to the alternatives for a robust planning that is coherent to the local environment and needs of resident. From previous works, it is clear that the on-going paradigm shift started in the 1990s. The new paradigm is characterised by the inclusion of more than one objective or evaluation criterion. This objective makes electrification planning a multidimensional process with clear evidence that the multi-criteria decision-making models offer better responses for the present-day requirements of decentralised energy planning in rural environments.",Volume 20,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/20/suppl/C,29
"Due to scarcity of firewood, farmers in rural Ethiopia are forced to use cattle dung as a complementary energy source. By looking at patterns of firewood and cattle dung use for energy generation and their implications for food crop production, forest regeneration and community level emission reduction potentials, this study explores system interactions using a community living next to the Menagesha Suba state forest in Ethiopia as a case study. Mixed methods were used including household surveys, nutrient content analyses of firewood and cattle dung, and calculations of fuel and emission reductions for four cooking energy efficiency scenarios. It was found that the community and surrounding environment is stuck in a negative feedback cycle. Therefore shifts in current practices and systems are needed to break this cycle, for example by enhancing firewood supply, improving soil fertility, improving energy efficiency and enabling access to carbon financing for emissions reduced.",Volume 20,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/20/suppl/C,29

In principle smart meters bring about higher control over energy theft and lower consumption, but require a high level of engagement by end-users. An alternative consists of load controllers, which control the load according to pre-set parameters. To date, research has focused on the impacts of these two alternatives separately. This study compares the sustainability impacts of smart meters and load controllers in an occupied office building in Italy.

"A major fraction of the rural population of India still burns biomass for domestic cooking and heating. Biomass materials such as wood, dung cakes and crop residues are burnt to produce energy for cooking. These are major sources of aerosol and gaseous pollutants in the atmosphere. Indoor measurements of gaseous species and chemical characteristics of aerosols contributed by burning biomass in traditional cooking stoves (TCS) vs. improved cooking stoves (ICS) are reported in this paper. Samples were collected from a village called Khairatpur, located in Sultanpur district of Uttar Pradesh state. The concentrations of aerosol components and gases in the indoor air during the operation of ICS were found to be lower as compared to TCS. On an average, total concentrations of major ions were lower by 32% during ICS operation. The most significant difference was observed for SO42 − aerosols (lower by 47%). Among SOx, NOx and NH3 gases, SOx showed maximum reduction (lower by 55%). Estimates of consumption of different types of biomasses showed that 621 t biomass is burnt annually by the villagers during cooking with TCS as compared to 365 t during ICS cooking. A social survey in the form of a questionnaire revealed that most of the women in the village of this study found ICS better than the TCS in terms of handling, reduced emissions, easier cooking and time & fuel efficiency.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"There are many examples of small-scale initiatives, based on exploitation of the jatropha-crude oil chain, to provide energy at local level, especially in the rural areas of a developing country, where mechanical pressing is currently the most widely used process to extract oil from seed. This study is a comparative analysis of the extraction performance parameters and the quality of the cold pressed oil obtained utilizing a commercial single screw extruder at the farm level for the extraction of Jatropha curcas, sunflower and rapeseed oil. In the case of J. curcas, the best operating results were obtained at a seed feed rate of 25.7 kg/h yielding about 8 kg/h of oil. This result, although satisfactory, was much lower than that of the rape and sunflower seeds. The levels of the main mineral contents (phosphorus, calcium and magnesium) in the jatropha oil, are significantly higher than those specified in the DIN V 51605 standard. Moreover jatropha oil showed high K and Na content (> 2 ppm), the elements that promote deposit formations in engines, while these were not detectable in rapeseed and sunflower oil. Preventive measures (optimizing harvest and storage condition) and avoiding an excessive rise in oil temperature (< 50 °C) during the extraction process are necessary to improve the quality of the jatropha crude oil. In order to meet the quality standards of the new DIN 51506, in order to reduce the mineral elements content in the jatropha oil (especially P, Ca + Mg) inert additives may be mixed with the oil during the seed processing, but these additives can lower the oxidation stability of the oil, so a stabilizer also needs to be added. Moreover these steps complicate the technological process and lower the commercial value of the oil, clearly demonstrating the advantage of producing oil with low concentration of P, Ca + Mg and K + Na in the first place.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"Providing sustainable energy access is one of the most critical global challenges. This paper introduces a method for evaluating the status and progress of rural household energy sustainability in developing countries using a new composite indicator, the energy sustainability index (ESI). The ESI combines 13 techno-economic, environmental and social indicators of sustainability using principal component analysis (PCA). We apply the ESI to China, India, South Africa, Sri-Lanka, Bangladesh and Ghana between 1990 and 2010. The analysis suggests that South Africa's rural energy sustainability index is highest followed by China, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh and Ghana respectively. All the countries' rural energy sustainability has improved relatively over time except Ghana's.

"Lack of access to electricity is linked to poverty and human development. In 2009, the number of people without access to electricity exceeded 1.3 billion, about one-fifth of the world's population. More than 99.8% of this total lives in developing countries, and more than 84% lives in rural areas. The eight current United Nations Millennium Development Goals (UN MDGs) and their respective targets do not include any target or indicator associated with energy. Many studies, however, have concluded that access to electricity must play a variety of vital direct and indirect roles in achieving the MDGs. As the MDGs are due to be met in 2015, the Member States of the United Nations have, since 2010, been debating and formulating a new framework for the post-2015 UN development agenda. The aim of this study is to argue, based on a review of statistical data on energy use and the normative rationales of the MDGs, that ensuring access to electricity and meeting minimum basic electricity needs of the energy poor should be considered by governments and the international community as a goal for the post-2015 UN development agenda.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"Fuelwood and charcoal are fundamental fuel sources for the residential sector in Mexico. A Business-As-Usual (BAU) projection by means of a spatially-explicit approach was developed to assess national fuelwood and charcoal consumption for the period 2010 to 2030. The model was calibrated for 1990–2000 and 2010 projections were validated against official census data for the same year. For 2010, we estimated that fuelwood and charcoal accounted for 48% of total residential energy demand. The projection of fuelwood consumption declined slightly from 19.4 Mt (dry matter) or 310 PJ in 2010 to 18.4 Mt or 294 PJ by 2030. An important future growth of mixed fuelwood–LPG users is expected pointing out that fuel stacking rather than fuel switching out of fuelwood would prevail. Charcoal consumption increased from 3.8 Mt (dried wood equivalent) or 61 PJ to 4.7 Mt or 75 PJ during the same period. A relevant outcome of the spatial assessment was the uncovering of large variations in fuelwood and charcoal use trends among spatial units (municipalities), hidden by the national aggregated trends. This opens up the opportunity to analyze regional variability to identify priority areas regarding fuelwood and charcoal use.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"Fruits and vegetables are an integral part of the human diet. Many developing countries such as Tanzania experience post-harvest losses of 40%, and there is little ability to preserve and store foods for off-season consumption due to expensive or unreliable energy and a lack of access to refrigeration. Alternatively, fruits and vegetables can be dehydrated using solar crop dryers. Because many developing countries are in tropical regions, properly dehydrating fruits and vegetables to moisture levels appropriate for storage and off-season consumption can be difficult. In an attempt to overcome the challenges of the high humidity, intermittent clouds, and haze often present in tropical climates, this paper investigates the effectiveness of adding a concave solar concentrator built from low-cost, locally available materials to a typical Tanzanian solar crop dryer. Two identical solar crop dryers were constructed, with one serving as the control and the other for testing the solar concentrator. Drying trials using Roma tomatoes with initial moisture content of approximately 90% were conducted in Davis, California (38° 32′ 42″ N/121° 44′ 21″ W) in various climatic conditions throughout the summer and fall. Tomatoes were considered dried at 10% moisture content. Temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation were measured outside as well as within each of the dryers to determine how the addition of a solar concentrator can affect the drying rate of tomatoes in solar crop dryers. The concentrator proved to be effective, reducing drying time by 21% in addition to increasing internal dryer temperature and reducing relative humidity. An additional study on the quality of the fresh and dried tomatoes found that the pH, titratable acidity, color, Brix, lycopene, and vitamin C determined there was no significant difference in quality between tomatoes dried with and without the concentrator.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"Green building assessment is currently being introduced into Serbian building practice. Since there is no Serbian certification system which could support building assessment, and especially lighting design evaluation, this paper analyzes and compares the lighting design criteria of three international certification systems, LEED, BREEAM and CASBEE. Specific requirements for each considered criterion, as well as the grading structure and stringency of these systems, are also analyzed. Based on the conclusions of these analyses, a new set of criteria, some of which are original, are offered in order to be incorporated into the future Serbian certification system. Taking into account that the structure of the future system is unknown, the basic applied principle was simplicity for application and, therefore, a single requirement is defined for each criterion. Finally, a hierarchy within the new set of criteria is established for both indoor and outdoor lighting. Mandatory criteria are selected first, while the remaining criteria are divided into two groups based on their relevance. Although predominantly intended for the improvement of Serbian building practice, the proposed set of assessment criteria is general and can be used throughout the world.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"In many developing countries, the national electricity grid fails to provide rural communities with a reliable supply of electricity. Given the high socio-economic cost of this policy failure, both scholars and policymakers have recently become interested in off-grid electrification programs. However, the relationship between national grid expansion and off-grid electrification remains unclear. Are these two approaches independent of each other, or perhaps even competitors? This article develops a taxonomy that allows grid expansion and off-grid electrification to complement each other. Explicit policy integration is necessary to encourage investment in off-grid electrification and avoid duplication of effort. Otherwise, there is a danger that the poorest and geographically most remote segments of the rural population could be left outside electrification efforts.

"The possibility of using hybrid energy system for electricity generation in rural and semi-urban areas in the Northern part of Nigeria was investigated in this study. The global solar radiation data and residential energy consumption in Jos, (in Plateau state) located on the latitude of 9° 52′ N and longitude of 8° 54′ E are used. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software has been employed to carry out the present study. At current diesel price of $1.1/L and annual mean global solar radiation of 6.00 kWh/m2/day, it was found that PV/Generator/Battery hybrid system is economically the most suitable option as a stand-alone electricity generating system in this location and other similar locations in the Northern part of Nigeria. The optimal simulation results indicate that the levelised cost of energy for this hybrid energy system varies between $0.348/kWh and $0.378/kWh depending on the interest rate. These costs are lower than the cost of using diesel generator only (without battery) which varies between $0.417 and $0.423 per kWh. It was further observed that there is a significant reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases if a hybrid energy system is used instead of only a generator based energy system. The effect of interest rate and cost of PV system on the optimal energy in this part of Nigeria was investigated and a comparison between the monthly cost of electricity using current tariff of grid connected and hybrid energy systems was also made.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"We introduce a new conceptual approach to green data centers through the use of multiple, distributed networked data centers that are co-located with renewable energy. While green data centers are a well-established objective, conventional approaches have focused on either high efficiencies and/or the use of renewable energy. This model extends and innovates both approaches with three key design aspects. First, it emphasizes the use of many small, geographically distributed mini data centers. Second, such data centers can operate with the option of being dislocated from the electrical grid via a mini-grid, or behind the meter. Third, the approach enhances the use of renewable energy via the ability to transfer computing load from one mini data center to another as renewable supply or market contexts dictate. This paper introduces the conceptual approach, outlines the research broadly, and examines potential technical, economic, and policy constraints for the establishment of this approach on a broad scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of this model for the developing world, particularly in areas without substantial electricity transmission infrastructure.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"In this study, the Network Planner, a decision support tool for exploring costs of different electrification technology options in un-electrified communities, was used to model costs and other inputs for providing electricity to 2600 un-electrified communities in Ghana within a 10-year planning period. The results show that the cost-optimized option for majority of the un-electrified communities will be grid connection, accounting for more 85% of the total un-electrified communities in each region. The total cost of electrification (which includes initial and recurring) at 100% penetration rate totalled US$ 696 million with a breakdown as follows: US$ 592 million for grid electrification, US$ 47 million for off-grid electrification and US$ 58 million for mini-grid compatible communities. Sensitivity analysis shows that model scenarios with higher electricity demand and higher household penetration rate generally recommend a larger percentage of communities for grid electrification, rather than off-grid or diesel mini-grid. One important aspect of this modelling approach is that it predicts costs for different electricity generation technologies for each of the communities involved and thus gives the planner the freedom to explore the most cost-effective technology based on existing conditions in the community and price trend of electrification inputs during the planning period.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30

"In Lao PDR, a least developed country in South-East Asia, provision of electricity to remote areas is a high priority for the Government, which has the objective of electrifying 90% of the population (in terms of number of households) by the year 2020. While this objective is commendable and tremendous progress has been made over the past 10 years in terms of rural electrification, some important questions remain unanswered. Currently, grid extension is the main technical option considered. One of the main reasons for this push for grid extension is the assumption that access to the grid means development. However, when analysed closely, the reality from the field is far more complex. Although grid electricity has tremendous potential to provide economic development opportunities in rural areas, it also has some drawbacks. In particular, productive activities fail to develop in many grid connected villages where the demand for electricity remains low even after a few years after having been grid electrified. This paper argues that alternative options to grid extension, e.g. off-grid decentralised renewable energy (DRE), exist, are often more attractive financially and could be promoted more effectively. These technologies can be cheaper than grid extension, even on a like-for-like comparison.2 DRE technologies also provide opportunities for development, even without driving large productive loads. These opportunities are presented in terms of 1) the flexibility of needs that DRE technologies can satisfy, 2) empowerment of rural communities and 3) decentralised decision making processes. So far, the promotion of DRE in Laos has not always been successful, but this should not be an argument against promoting these options. A close look at recent rural electrification project budgets reveals indeed that grid extension is far more subsidised than DRE, raising concerns about the social equity of such projects.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"The paper addresses the effect of particle size on tar generation in a fixed bed gasification system. Pyrolysis, a diffusion limited process, depends on the heating rate and the surface area of the particle influencing the release of the volatile fraction leaving behind residual char. The flaming time has been estimated for different biomass samples. It is found that the flaming time for wood flakes is almost one fourth than that of coconut shells for same equivalent diameter fuel samples. The particle density of the coconut shell is more than twice that of wood spheres, and almost four times compared with wood flakes; having a significant influence on the flaming time. The ratio of the particle surface area to that of an equivalent diameter is nearly two times higher for flakes compared with wood pieces. Accounting for the density effect, on normalizing with density of the particle, the flaming rate is double in the case of wood flakes or coconut shells compared with the wood sphere for an equivalent diameter. This is due to increased surface area per unit volume of the particle. Experiments are conducted on estimation of tar content in the raw gas for wood flakes and standard wood pieces. It is observed that the tar level in the raw gas is about 80% higher in the case of wood flakes compared with wood pieces. The analysis suggests that the time for pyrolysis is lower with a higher surface area particle and is subjected to fast pyrolysis process resulting in higher tar fraction with low char yield. Increased residence time with staged air flow has a better control on residence time and lower tar in the raw gas.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"Subsidy programs, such as feed-in tariffs, designed to make renewable technologies cost competitive with fossil fuels in electricity generation, have been effective in a number of nations. However, these subsidies can become very costly and they raise questions whether there are fair conditions for competition for different energy sources. As a result even effective programs face an uncertain future, changes in political support following the financial crises in Europe and the United States have demonstrated. In the case of solar photovoltaic energy, cost declines resulting from market-expansion schemes and the overall reductions in the price of photovoltaic cells have been significant particularly over the past decade. Yet, they have still left solar power up to 50% more expensive than conventional options. As an alternative in this paper we describe a financing tool based on a pollution abatement methodology. In developing this levelized cost of electricity framework we build a methodology to examine, and then utilize, the social costs and impacts of energy generation technologies. We find that as a means to bridge the cost gap between current conventional energy process and retail solar energy, a program based on a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loan program would, in the short-term, be an effective tool to accelerate grid parity between solar and conventional energy generation and in the long-term provides a theoretically and financially sound alternative to subsidy-based incentives.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"Replacing traditional stoves with advanced alternatives that burn more cleanly has the potential to ameliorate major health problems associated with indoor air pollution in developing countries. With a few exceptions, large government and charitable programs to distribute advanced stoves have not had the desired impact. Commercially-based distributions that seek cost recovery and even profits might plausibly do better, both because they encourage distributors to supply and promote products that people want and because they are based around properly-incentivized supply chains that could more be scalable, sustainable, and replicable.The sale in India of over 400,000 “Oorja” stoves to households from 2006 onwards represents the largest commercially-based distribution of a gasification-type advanced biomass stove. BP's Emerging Consumer Markets (ECM) division and then successor company First Energy sold this stove and the pelletized biomass fuel on which it operates. We assess the success of this effort and the role its commercial aspect played in outcomes using a survey of 998 households in areas of Maharashtra and Karnataka where the stove was sold as well as detailed interviews with BP and First Energy staff. Statistical models based on this data indicate that Oorja purchase rates were significantly influenced by the intensity of Oorja marketing in a region as well as by pre-existing stove mix among households. The highest rate of adoption came from LPG-using households for which Oorja's pelletized biomass fuel reduced costs. Smoke- and health-related messages from Oorja marketing did not significantly influence the purchase decision, although they did appear to affect household perceptions about smoke. By the time of our survey, only 9% of households that purchased Oorja were still using the stove, the result in large part of difficulties First Energy encountered in developing a viable supply chain around low-cost procurement of “agricultural waste” to make pellets. The business orientation of First Energy allowed the company to pivot rapidly to commercial customers when the household market encountered difficulties. The business background of managers also facilitated the initial marketing and distribution efforts that allowed the stove distribution to reach scale.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"In the frame of an enhanced environmental discussion regarding the existence and convenience of energy decoupling or dematerialization, this paper studies the past trends of global primary energy resources in relation to monetary and demographic variables in a top-down framework. This paper aims at contributing to the literature on dematerialization and energy sustainability from a dynamic perspective, with the purpose of shedding light on some questions, such as the real existence of an intergenerational energy dematerialization. To this purpose we use the phase diagrams of energy intensity and the product generational dematerialization (PGD) indicator for the period 1970–2011 for the global economy, the OECD and Latin American and Caribbean regions, China and India. While from energy intensity perspective a decoupling trend can be observed, we found no evidence for global intergenerational sustainable energy path in the long term. In this context, some questions related to the real impact of past and future environmental policies on energy consumption arise, especially in relation to developing countries.",Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
An experimental setup to investigate the thermal performance of a cylindrical cavity receiver for an SK-14 parabolic dish concentrator is presented in this technical note. The thermal performance is evaluated using energy and exergy analyses. The receiver exergy rates and efficiencies are found to be appreciably smaller than the receiver energy rates and efficiencies. The exergy factor parameter is also proposed for quantifying the thermal performance. The exergy factor is found to be high under conditions of high solar radiation and under high operating temperatures. The heat loss factor of the receiver is determined to be around 4.6 W/K. An optical efficiency of around 52% for parabolic dish system is determined under high solar radiation conditions. This experimental setup can be used as teaching tool for people with little or no knowledge about solar dish concentrators due its simplicity and the basic mathematical formulations applied. Different types of receivers and different types of deep focal region parabolic dishes can also be tested with the experimental setup.,Volume 19,April 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/19/suppl/C,30
"Household energy related accidents such as burns and poisonings are not included amongst the causes of health burdens from residential energy use in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and other similar assessments. This is a serious omission in the case of transitional developmental states, such as South Africa, where these can be significant. This study analyses the risks associated with burns, scalds and poisonings from the use of household fuels in South Africa, adopting an environmental risk transition framework. We employ quantitative data from a nationally representative household energy consumption survey and hospital treatment data on energy incident injuries from a sample of 17 hospitals around South Africa to assess the relationship between the risk of these accidents, household income and energy poverty. Previous research on risk transitions provides clear evidence of a transition away from risks associated with household pollution with rising income, and also suggests that the evidence regarding injuries appears to decrease with rising income. We, however, find that in the case of South Africa, the relationship between poverty and burn and poison incidents due to household energy use maybe non-linear. The results of our analysis suggest that the risks of burn incidents and fires initially rise with income only to decrease at higher income levels. Moreover, for households below an energy poverty threshold, the risks of energy related accidents rise with an increase in household energy use, but falls once households cross this threshold. This suggests that a pro-poor approach is needed in designing programmes that lower the overall risk of these incidents. In addition, more rapid household energy transitions that displace paraffin with LPG and candles with electricity or solar power can help reduce the incidence and burden of these accidents.",Volume 18,February 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/18/suppl/C,31
"Between 2004 and 2007, NGOs, community based organisations and private investors promoted jatropha in Kenya with the aim of generating additional income and producing biofuel for rural development. By 2008 it became gradually evident that jatropha plantations (both mono- and intercropping) are uneconomical and risky due to competition for land and labour with food crops. Cultivation of jatropha hedges was found to have better chances of economic success and to present only little risks for the adopting farmers. Still, after 2008 a number of farmers went on adopting jatropha in plots rather than as hedges. It is hypothesised that lack of awareness about the low economic prospects of jatropha plantations was the main reason for continued adoption, and that smallholder farmers with higher resource endowments mainly ventured into its cultivation.In this study we provide an empirical basis for understanding the role of households' capital assets in taking up new livelihood strategies by smallholder farmers in three rural districts in Kenya. For that purpose, we assess the motivation and enabling factors that led to the adoption of jatropha as a new livelihood strategy, as well as the context in which promotion and adoption took place. A household survey was conducted in 2010, using a structured questionnaire, to collect information on household characteristics and capital asset endowment. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and non-parametric statistical tests.We established that access to additional income and own energy supply were the main motivation for adoption of jatropha, and that financial capital assets do not necessarily have a positive influence on adoption as hypothesised. Further, we found that the main challenges that adopting farmers faced were lack of access to information on good management practices and lack of a reliable market. We conclude that continued adoption of on-farm jatropha after 2008 is a result of lacking awareness about the low economic value of this production type. We recommend abandoning on-farm production of jatropha until improved seed material and locally adapted agronomic knowledge about jatropha cultivation becomes available and its production becomes economically competitive.",Volume 18,February 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/18/suppl/C,31

"Load prediction is an essential component of the planning process of decentralized electricity supply systems based on micro-grids. However, accurate demand forecasting is a challenging task particularly for rural electrification projects. In this paper, actual operational data of a PV based micro-grid system in Sagar Island of India are analyzed in order to understand the role of different factors affecting households' connectivity, their electricity consumption and potential demands, thereby proposing an approach for planning (and designing) a micro-grid based decentralized electricity supply system. The analysis shows that potential demands for electricity within (as well as outside of) the current reach of the micro-grid are high and future expansion of the system would be effective by taking a 'phased approach’ of rural electrification. The analysis also shows that households with certain socio-economic characteristics have higher probability for connecting with the micro-grid and the relationship can be used to predict additional load requirements in case of grid extensions. Few recommendations for enhancing the connectivity further are also included in the discussion section of the paper.",Volume 18,February 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/18/suppl/C,31
"Jaggery (unrefined sugar) is produced by evaporating water from sugarcane juice in steel pans situated over pit furnaces. While it delivers a health friendly sweetening agent with medicinal value (Singh et al., 2008, Sahu and Paul, 1998), its performance, both in terms of technical efficacy and financial sustenance, is being questioned. In India, jaggery is produced in batch operations, of about 1 ton per day capacity. Bagasse is used as fuel for the process. Improving the efficiency of bagasse utilization is of interest because surplus bagasse could be used elsewhere as a fuel. If all energy in the bagasse were used to heat and evaporate water from the juice, calculations show the rate of bagasse consumption would be 0.65 kg bagasse per kg jaggery. Heat losses in flue gas at 1000 K with no excess oxygen are calculated to decrease the efficiency to 72% (0.90 kg bagasse per kg jaggery). In this study, two single-pan jaggery units were tested wherein, efficiencies varied from 53-76% and 50–57%. The higher efficiencies in each unit were obtained by blocking some of the air inlet holes to decrease the excess air flow. The second unit has a taller chimney than the first, which may contribute to greater air flow due to increased draft. Excess air contributes to lower combustion temperatures, causing a decreased rate of heat transfer to the juice. Minimizing excess air flow into the furnace is a possible strategy for increasing the efficiency of bagasse utilization and might be implemented quite easily by placing dampers at air inlets. This study also included tests of one four-pan jaggery unit. Measured efficiencies were about 50%. Radiative heat transfer to three of the four pans is calculated to be hindered substantially by a low view factor.",Volume 18,February 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/18/suppl/C,31
"This study estimates energy consumption and related GHG emissions for the buildings and facilities of the main university campus at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The campus has a built area of 1.3 km2. Based on the strategic plan of growth, a scenario analysis for 2020 was also developed estimating baseline and mitigation scenarios that include energy efficiency technologies and solar water heating. To estimate energy consumption, a representative sample of buildings and facilities by category was selected in order to develop level I and when possible level II energy audits. The study was complemented with results of level III energy audits performed in previous studies for some buildings. The bottom-up results from energy audits were compared to the electricity bill for the whole campus. We found that lighting represents 28% of total energy use, followed by special research equipment 17%, refrigeration 14%, and water heating that includes the Olympic swimming pool 9%. If energy efficiency technologies are applied for retrofitting and considered for new buildings in lighting, refrigeration, air conditioning; and a hybrid system (solar–electric–LPG) is used for water heating, energy consumption could be 7.5% less than in 2011 and CO2 emissions 11.3% less than in 2011.",Volume 18,February 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/18/suppl/C,31
"Fuelwood is generally assumed to be a commodity in the development literature, thus overlooking the possibility of catering to niche markets that could potentially be served more efficiently. Identifying and better catering to niche market segments through product differentiation can play an important role in increasing the income of those involved in the fuelwood supply chain. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the role of market segmentation and product differentiation within the fuelwood industry and how it affects both market opportunities and value. This is illustrated using a case study of the largest fuelwood consuming cottage industry in the department of Madríz, Nicaragua. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 fuelwood consuming business owners to obtain information on 1) the business itself and their fuelwood purchasing preferences; and 2) questions relating to fuelwood demand and prices. This information was complimented with the measurement of fuelwood purchasing units and logs in order to calculate solid wood volumes and product segment characteristics. We found that bakeries consumed four differentiated fuelwood products, mostly defined by the small-end diameter of the logs, each of which was valued differently. Differences in fuelwood product preferences were found when the market was segmented by municipality and by the number of wood-fired ovens operated by individual bakeries. This study highlights the existence of product differentiation within the fuelwood market and the potential of identifying niche markets to help fuelwood producers increase their income. Although traditionally assumed to be a commodity, different fuelwood consumers value different characteristics and attributes in fuelwood and are willing to pay different prices based on this differentiation. Taking this into account was important for determining market value. Such considerations should be taken into account when evaluating market opportunities and value within fuelwood markets, particularly in a developing country context.",Volume 18,February 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/18/suppl/C,31
"Biofuels derived from microalgae are currently gaining attention as alternative fuels, especially for substituting biodiesel. Microalgae can be grown either in open pond systems or in closed photobioreactors. However, the systems require a high initial capital investment for construction of pond and photobioreactor systems. This study aims to evaluate the financial feasibility of two types of large scale microalgae-based biodiesel production assumed to be located in the northern region of Thailand. Four algae-to-biofuels process scenarios were examined: base cases of raceway ponds and photobioreactors including only biodiesel production; and alternative cases for both, including extraction of high value added products, omega-3 fatty acids, in addition to biodiesel. The basis of biodiesel production was 720,000 L per year operated for 15 years. For the base case, the biodiesel production costs for algae produced from raceway ponds and photobioreactors were 68 and 224 Thai Baht/L, respectively, while for the alternative case, they were 191 and 450 Thai Baht/L, respectively. Even though the omega-3 fatty acid production gained higher revenue, the capital cost and operating cost would need to be reduced at least 50% to make the systems profitable.

"In order to contribute to the agricultural residue recovery in a sustainable way in Colombia, an atmospheric bubbling fluidized bed reactor fed with rice husk (with nominal capacity of 150 kWth) was evaluated under gasification conditions. This system was assessed using a statistical design of experiments based on the response surface methodology-RSM (central composite design—CCD) in order to obtain empirical correlations for describing the performance behavior of the process in terms of the equivalence ratio (ER) and the normalized fluidization velocity (Unc). The lower heating value, the volumetric gas yield, the gas power and the cold gasification efficiency were the output variables. Optimum conditions with respect to both the lower heating value (3.78 MJ/Nm3) and the gas power (73.82 kW) were obtained at ER of 0.24 and Unc of 0.19 m/s. However, the height of the initial fixed bed of inerts requires to be higher in order to increase the mass and energy transfer conditions and hence the carbon conversion. The statistical correlations obtained are considered acceptable taking into account the complexity of the gasification phenomena in fluidized bed.

"This paper empirically assesses energy poverty from an end-user perspective. The concept of an energy poverty penalty is developed arguing that people that are deprived of a certain level of energy service quality (e.g. lack access to the grid) spend more money on energy relative to their total income than people who enjoy better energy service quality. Additionally, it is tested whether these people also pay more in absolute terms given the same income level measured by asset indices. Both conditions are met in the analysis of a conducted dataset consisting of 342 households and micro-businesses in the rural area of Arequipa, Peru. Mobile phone network coverage is used as proxy for remoteness criteria and to build data strata, thus facilitating model replication for different geographical areas and a systematic measurement of structural handicaps. It is further shown that it serves as a better proxy for remoteness than the mere measure of distance to the capital. Income is proxied by two forms of asset indices further representing pure asset poverty and multidimensional poverty. The penalty is found to be most prevalent in the lowest income segments. The paper sheds light on the relationship between energy poverty, remoteness and implications for the people's development opportunities. The proof of the energy poverty penalty has strong implications for the present perception of energy poverty. Its existence raises questions on the impact of this penalty with respect to causing a trap that is delaying (rural) development at the household level or even prohibiting the development path. It leads to further discussion on the causality between energy service quality and economic development at low-income segments in a country.",Volume 18,February 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/18/suppl/C,31
"Sustainability has emerged as one of the important planning concepts from its beginnings in economics and ecological thinking, and has widely been applied to assessing urban development. Different methods, techniques and instruments for urban sustainability assessment that help determine how cities can become more sustainable have emerged over a period of time. Among these, indicator-based approaches contribute to building of sustainable self-regulated systems that integrate development and environment protection. Hence, these provide a solid foundation for decision-making at all levels and are being increasingly used.

"Global demand for electricity and mobile phone (MP) service is increasing rapidly as a result of emerging markets in developing countries. Compared to the growth of mobile networks, the relatively high cost and technical limitations of extending electricity grids have left over 500 million MP users without access to electricity. MP charging has become one of the major end-use demands in rural electrification projects, where MP users spend disproportionate amounts of time and money seeking charging services.This study investigates the energy and power requirements of MP charging. The energy and power demands of MP charging are determined experimentally using the charge configuration commonly found in developing countries: an inverter powered by a 12 volt car battery. The objective is to quantify the power and energy demand for MPs, and the overall efficiency of the systems used to charge them. By analyzing the charging configurations on an energy efficiency basis and identifying the major losses, recommendations for improvement are made.Results show that the average energy requirement per MP charge is 7 Wh, but due to efficiency losses in the inverter, the total energy requirement can reach up to 13 Wh. The efficiency of the inverter increases with the number of MPs being charged simultaneously, ranging from 50% for a single phone to 85% for 15 phones. The peak power requirement per MP is 7 W.","Volume 17, Issue 6",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/6,32
"The objective of this research is to estimate the potential effects of migration on residential energy use and CO2 emissions in Hanoi, Vietnam, a location in which urbanization and migration are occurring simultaneously. This article estimates the effects of migration on residential energy use and CO2 emissions quantitatively, basing the probability of being a migrant on the economic, demographic and dwelling characteristics of households. The results of this study indicate that the effects of migration involve reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Urban-to-urban migration is shown to have no statistically significant impact on per capita energy consumption and CO2 emissions, which indicates that population increases through urban-to-urban population growth and natural population growth have no statistically significant differences in this regard. However, rural-to-urban migration is shown to have a significant and negative influence on residential energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Population growth led by rural-to-urban migration produces lower energy consumption estimates than natural population growth. Thus, energy consumption estimates are lower when a city's population increase is caused by rural-to-urban migration than when urban-to-urban migration and natural population growth are the main drivers of population increases. These results have important policy implications for developing urban cities regarding population growth and energy consumption.","Volume 17, Issue 6",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/6,32
"Renewable energy based village grids (RVGs) are widely considered to be a sustainable solution for rural electrification in non-OECD countries. However, diffusion rates of RVGs are relatively low. We take the viewpoint that, as public resources are scarce, investments from the private sector are essential to scale-up the diffusion. While existing literature mostly focuses on engineering, development and techno-economic aspects, the private sector's perspective remains under-researched. As investment decisions by private investors are mainly based on the risk/return profile of potential projects we — based on literature reviews and field research — investigate the risk and the return aspects of RVGs in Indonesia, a country with one of the largest potentials for RVGs. We find that considering the potential of local, national and international revenue streams, the returns of RVGs can be positive. Regarding the risk aspect, we see that private investors could address many of the existing barriers through their business model. However, the findings also point to the need for government action in order to further improve the risk/return profile and thereby attract private investments for RVGs.","Volume 17, Issue 6",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/6,32
"Economic development in Indonesia has improved the people's welfare. As a result, household electricity consumption has risen continuously over the years. Indonesia's people come from a variety of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, which are steeped in several distinct regions. However, less attention has traditionally been paid to how household electricity consumption is influenced by local cultures. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of household electricity consumption and its driving factors under a variety of cultural backgrounds in a society plays an important role in designing proper regulations related to household energy savings. Two cities with different cultural backgrounds were selected for this study, namely Bandung and Yogyakarta. The factors driving electricity consumption are investigated using a field survey and classified according to how the electricity is used and the societal and economic characteristics. The relationships between electrical consumption and its driving factors are evaluated using multivariate data analysis. The results show that in Bandung, family size, time spent at home, education level, home appliances and lighting had a significant, positive effect on the monthly electricity bill. On the other hand, in Yogyakarta, education level and time spent at home had a negative impact on the monthly electricity bill. Based on these results, an energy conservation policy may not be generalisable but will have to be specified based on local characteristics to ensure that the policy is broadly adopted by society.","Volume 17, Issue 6",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/6,32
"Solar Photovoltaic (PV) technologies are gaining influence as a potential supplemental electricity source in Thailand. This study assesses the environmental and economic benefits of two types of photovoltaic technologies — single-crystalline and amorphous silicon thin-film systems. The advantages of building-integrated PV are also analyzed. The assessment considers embodied energy, CO2 payback, and economic investment. Solar PV currently provides less than 1% of Thailand's electricity; however the government aims to generate 25% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2021. Different policy scenarios affecting life cycle performance, including manufacturing processes and geographic differences are explored. The results indicate that solar electricity can serve as a promising, untapped renewable energy source for Thailand to pursue in its efforts to wean away from imported natural gas and other fossil fuel energy sources. Amorphous silicon thin-film panels yield a greater net environmental benefit than single-crystalline technologies. Even if panels are made in a high electricity emissions country, like China, PV reduces GHG emissions. A sustainable grid-connected photovoltaic system would combine appropriate solar photovoltaic technologies. An economic comparison is included to contextualize the findings. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) provides an invaluable tool for policymakers to evaluate such opportunities.","Volume 17, Issue 6",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/6,32
"Renewable energy is projected to meet a significant portion of the future energy needs of India. With solar energy, being abundantly available in most parts of the country, grid connected solar photovoltaic (SPV) power plants are assuming increasing importance. Energy fed into the grid by a solar power plant depends upon seasonal variation of the solar resource, losses due to temperature variation, system losses and losses due to condition of the grid. This paper presents performance analysis of a 3 MW grid connected SPV plant located in Karnataka State, India as per International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) Standard 61724, using monitored data. Normalised technical performance parameters of the plant are evaluated for the year 2011. Inverter failure losses and grid failure losses are estimated for two years of plant operation. Daily and seasonal variations in the SPV plant output are shown using monitored data at five-minute intervals. The SPV generation in relation to load duration curve of the substation is observed. A comparison of normalised performance parameters of the plant with similar parameters of other plants is given. Annual average energy generated by the plant was 1372 kWh per kWp of the installed capacity. Performance of the plant is satisfactory in comparison with that reported from other countries.","Volume 17, Issue 6",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/6,32
"The use of alternative fuels and advanced light-duty vehicle (LDV) technologies is gaining momentum worldwide in order to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has developed technical and cost targets at the component level for several advanced LDV technologies such as plug-in hybrid, battery electric, and fuel cell electric vehicles as well as cost targets for low-carbon fuels. DOE, Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) recently updated their analysis of well-to-wheels (WTW) greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, petroleum use, and the cost of ownership of vehicle technologies that have the potential to significantly reduce GHG emissions and petroleum consumption. A comprehensive assessment of how these alternative fuels and vehicle technologies options could cost-effectively meet the future carbon emissions and oil consumption targets has been conducted. This paper estimates the ownership cost and the potential reduction of WTW carbon emissions and oil consumption associated with alternative fuels and advanced LDV technologies. Efficient LDVs and low-carbon fuels can contribute to a substantial reduction in GHG emissions from the current 200–230 g/km for typical compact (small family) size diesel and gasoline vehicles. With RD&D success, the ownership costs of various advanced powertrains deployed in the 2035 time frame will likely converge, thus enhancing the probability of their market penetration. To attain market success, it is necessary that public and private sectors coordinate RD&D investments and incentive programs aiming at both reducing the cost of advanced vehicle technologies and establishing required fuel infrastructures.","Volume 17, Issue 6",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/6,32
"The performances of inverted absorber solar still integrated with a refrigeration cycle (RIASS) and an inverted absorber solar still (IASS) were experimentally investigated under identical operational and weather conditions. It was found that more yield of fresh water was achieved in RIASS as compared to IASS. The study revealed that the depth of the feed was inversely proportional to the productivity of the IASS. Hence, the daily production of the IASS was increased by reducing water depth in the basin. However, in the RIASS, the inverse behavior was reported. The daily yields from RIASS were 6.4, 10.08 and 9.5 l/day at water depths 4, 6 and 8 cm respectively. The respective daily yields achieved from the IASS were 3.41, 3.24 and 2.92 l/day that were lower than that of the RIASS. Also in case of RIASS, it was found that the night production was more as compared to the daytime production.","Volume 17, Issue 6",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/6,32
"This work shows the performance and emissions profile of a diesel engine operating with ethanol injected into the air of the inlet manifold in time with the high-pressure injection of a mixture of diesel and biodiesel. The ethanol injection uses an electronic management system that detects the high-pressure pulse in the diesel injection line as the injection trigger. The air intake temperature reduction caused by the ethanol injection could be evaluated. The tests were made in an engine at 1800 rpm, connected to an electric generator. The high-pressure injection fuel was always a binary blend of diesel and biodiesel, which was supplemented by injected ethanol, producing 5 different fuel compositions. The first of the tested compositions was the binary blend without ethanol, while the others had increasing alcohol content. The fifth composition used 15% of ethanol but had a 0.4% of the additive di-tert-butyl peroxide mixed in the main fuel. The addition of ethanol led to a reduction in diesel fuel consumption, although the overall energy expenditure was increased. The emissions profile showed a consistent reduction in NOx emissions and opacity with the addition of ethanol, breaking up the traditional inverse relationship between NOx and PM emissions, but shown an increase in CO and THC emissions. The energy analysis showed a decrease in engine efficiency with the addition of ethanol. The use of the additive showed a slight increase of engine efficiency and the reduction of the CO and THC emissions. There was a significant reduction in the air intake temperature with the use of ethanol, suggesting that part of the reduction of NOx may be attributed to this temperature reduction. It was proven that the ethanol addition can be an important method to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust gases of diesel engines.","Volume 17, Issue 6",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/6,32
"As production of biofuels from agricultural commodities is expanding, concerns about social and environmental implications are also rising. The production of biofuels may lead to both positive and negative socio-economic impacts. This paper analyzes the impacts of biodiesel demand on the price of oil palm and associated products using demand and supply function model. The impacts cover positive impacts i.e. currency savings and increase in farmers' income due to higher price of oil palm, and negative impacts i.e. increase in food price represented by bottled palm oil, and biodiesel for energy. The biodiesel blending ratios of 3, 5 and 10%, namely B3, B5 and B10, respectively are studied. The result reveals that the biodiesel implementation in Thailand has a minimal effect on palm oil price. Though the net socio-economic impact is negative, biodiesel has a positive contribution towards reducing fossil fuel demand and energy diversity.","Volume 17, Issue 6",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/6,32
This paper addresses material properties of Douglas fir and Sitka spruce and the development of an accurate and low-cost method to manufacture small wind turbine blades. Fatigue tests performed on Douglas fir and Sitka spruce show that these timbers have excellent fatigue properties for use in small wind turbine blades. A copying router was developed and tested to manufacture timber wind turbine blades of less than about 1.5 m in length by reproducing the shape of a master turbine blade. A co-ordinate measuring machine was used to establish that the copying router has an accuracy of ± 0.5 mm when copying cylindrical bars. It reproduced the general shape and twist of a master wind turbine blade. Future versions of the copying router can be improved by reproducing the trailing edge of turbine blades with higher accuracy.,"Volume 17, Issue 6",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/6,32
"Published data from quantitative assessments of in-home fuel use in developing countries are sparse, yet this information is important for understanding the basic daily energy consumption of half the world's population as well as the effectiveness of programs seeking to reduce the health, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts of using inefficient cooking technologies and fuels. This paper presents results from a coordinated training and field study program sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Projections Agency, with the goal of increasing our understanding of household energy use by building capacity of stove implementing organizations. The programs were conducted with stove organizations in India, Nepal, and Peru, with results from Nepal and Peru indicating the respective stove interventions resulted in significant fuel savings (~ 27–66%), and in India the energy consumption from combined usage of a pellet stove and liquefied petroleum gas was 59% lower than use of traditional biomass stoves. The fuel savings in Peru were highly dependent on the level of stove maintenance and user training with the largest savings (66% per capita) achieved in homes where the stoves were maintained and users were provided additional training, indicating that these are critical factors for realizing maximum stove performance in homes. Combining these results with previously published KPT results showed patterns of higher baseline fuelwood consumption in Latin America (2.1–3.4 kg per capita per day) in comparison to Nepal and India (1.0–1.4 kg per capita per day). The fuel savings estimates from the KPT studies were generally similar to savings estimates for controlled testing (Water Boiling Tests and Controlled Cooking Tests) of the respective program stoves, showing promise for better linking stove performance in the laboratory with field performance. Finally, variability of fuel consumption and fuel savings estimates are examined to inform on study design and monitoring for carbon offset methodologies.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"Monitoring the production from 94 coalbed methane (CBM) wells in the southern part of the Qinshui Basin of China this study demonstrates production characteristics of CBM wells, and how the incorrect production system, including improper water drainage rates and wellhead pressures, can lead to diminished gas production. Using data from these wells our results suggest that high-production rate wells, medium-production rate wells, low-production rate wells, and drainage wells, are controlled by drainage conditions in addition to the well location and structural geology. The analysis of drainage parameters shows that the maximum wellhead pressure should be maintained around 1.5 MPa before stable production, and between 0.10 MPa and 0.30 MPa after stable production. The most efficient average water production rate is approximately 4 m3/day before gas production and should be maintained near 1 m3/day during gas production. Initial daily average water production rate should be maintained around 1.5 m3/day. Maximum water production rate should be regulated between 4 and 17 m3/day. The rate of water level reduction should be within 4 m/d and drainage time should be maintained for 50–200 days prior to gas production. Implementation of these optimal drainage parameters will promote and sustain peak gas production for several years. In addition, reservoirs with adequate permeability, > 0.1 mD, are ideal for electric submersible pump systems while sucker-rod pumps are better suited for reservoirs with poor permeability. The combination of these operating conditions and the appropriate pumps optimizes the extraction efficiency and recovery of coalbed methane from the anthracitic coals in the Qinshui Basin.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"Photovoltaic micro utility (MU) systems introduced in the rural areas of Bangladesh in 1999 currently number more than 10,000 systems. This paper presents the details and results of component and system performance of 35 MU systems installed by Grameen Shakti in 7 districts of Bangladesh through survey and performance studies. 50 Wp was the most common system size. The average overall efficiency of PV MU systems was 5.4%. The performances of battery and charge controller were also investigated and found to be satisfactory. The actual energy obtained by the users was also very close to the design values though the batteries were slightly oversized for lower capacity systems. The degradation of panel performance was not significant with age. The payback period of these systems were between 4.2 and 6.28 years, and the levelized electricity cost of PV MU systems was estimated to be 70 BDT (~ 0.85 $)/kWh. Users observed that after installing the PV MU systems, their communication with customers and suppliers improved, as well as their comfort. Furthermore, these systems also contributed to reduction of emissions and indoor air pollution.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications are gaining widespread popularity. The performance of any given BIPV system is dependent on prevalent meteorological factors, site conditions and system characteristics. Investigations pertaining to the performance assessment of photovoltaic (PV) systems are generally confined to either controlled environment-chambers or computer-based simulation studies. Such investigations fall short of providing a realistic insight into how a PV system actually performs real-time. Solar radiation and the PV cell temperature are amongst the most crucial parameters affecting PV output. The current paper deals with the real-time performance assessment of a recently commissioned 5.25 kWp BIPV system installed at the Center for Sustainable Technologies, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The overall average system efficiency was found to be 6% for the period May 2011–April 2012.

"In this work, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method is used to investigate the environmental impacts of two recent energy efficient streetlight technologies, Ceramic Metal Halide (CMH) and Light Emitting Diode (LED), with the aim of assessing their application in Abu Dhabi — United Arab Emirates (UAE). The cradle to grave analysis for CMH and LED streetlights includes raw material extraction, production of streetlight fixture, use and end of life scenario, all modeled using the SimaPro software package. The results show that LED lights have larger environmental impact during the production stage, but this is offset during the operational life of the lamp, due to the lower energy consumption of LEDs. For both types of lamps, the production stage has significantly less overall impact when compared to the impact during their operational life. The analysis in this paper also covers a scenario where stand-alone light fixtures are powered by photovoltaic (PV) panels, with and without battery recycling, in addition to a scenario where the energy used for operation comes from a solar power plant. In all the cases analyzed, the LED lamp has a lower overall environmental impact. Furthermore, our analysis shows that most environmental impacts come from battery production, consumption of fossil fuels for energy, and transportation of parts.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"Children in government schools in Karnataka, India are provided cooked mid-day meals under the ‘Akshara Dasoha’ scheme. The aim of this initiative is to provide a nutritious meal to school children (who mostly hail from the lower economic strata) to enhance their nutritional status and as an incentive to minimize dropouts. However, cooking these meals have numerous bottlenecks including irregular supply of cooking fuel i.e. liquid petroleum gas (LPG) resulting in widespread use of firewood, which is burnt inefficiently and use of a single variety of vegetable due to frequent price fluctuations.A comprehensive and replicable concept that was aimed at demonstrating the use of environmentally sustainable renewable energy device for cooking, raising an energy plantation and growing a bio-intensive school garden to address the above issues was pilot tested in three rural primary schools in the semi-arid area of Ramdurg taluk, Belgaum district, Karnataka, with the active participation of children and local communities. The concept focused on a decentralized community approach to enhance the use of local resources in an environmentally sustainable manner. The pilot test proved that the concept could be replicated and customized to the needs of any community where similar issues exist.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33

"A detailed analysis of the change in the patterns of energy use in a Mexican village, from the year 1986 to 2012 is presented. The satisfaction of energy needs is analyzed according to the first- and second-law efficiencies of thermodynamics, for a total of 22 end-uses. The analysis covers both the end-use devices used for energy conversion and the energy and exergy used in the related thermodynamical tasks. The final energy per capita was 11.0 GJ/year in 2012, about 10% less than in 1986. In the study period, the overall first-law efficiency of the community increased from 17% to 23%, while the second-law efficiency rose from 6.4% to 8.2%. The increments in useful energy and minimum exergy (total and per capita), relative to 1986, occur at the expense of a small increase in the per capita consumption of final exergy of the community.The rise of both energy efficiencies is a consequence of the reduction in fuelwood consumption and on the use of draft-animals, whose conversion efficiencies into final energies and useful work are extremely low. Also, there is 314% increase in the village's fossil fuel use, especially due to an increase in the penetration of gas and electric appliances into the household sector and of vehicles. The energy use in the productive sector including agriculture fell dramatically. CO2 emissions from the community's energy use rose by 279%.Despite the increase of commercial energy use, and a rapid penetration of LPG cookstoves, fuelwood still represents 68% of the village final energy consumption. Also, there is a large mismatch between sources and needs in thermodynamic terms: while 72% of the energy needs correspond to work and heat at less than 100 °C, 99% of the energy sources imply combustion processes (fuelwood, LPG, gasoline and diesel) to mid and high temperatures. However, in order to reduce CO2 emissions, the electricity and transport devices have to increase their efficiencies, and primary energy ought to come in higher proportion from renewable sources.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"In this work, the energy performance of a domestic refrigerator has been assessed theoretically with R134a and R430A as alternative refrigerant. The performance has been assessed for three different condensing temperatures, specifically, 40, 50 and 60 °C with a wide range of evaporator temperatures between − 30 and 0 °C. The performance of the domestic refrigerator was compared in terms of volumetric cooling capacity, coefficient of performance, compressor power consumption and compressor discharge temperature. Total equivalent global warming impact of the refrigerator was assessed for a 15-year life time. The results showed that volumetric cooling capacities of R430A and R134a are similar, so that R134a compressor can be used for R430A without modifications. The coefficient of performance of R430A was found to be higher than that of R134a by about 2.6–7.5% with 1–9% lower compressor power consumption at all operating temperatures. The compressor discharge temperature of R430A was observed to be 3–10 °C higher than that of R134a. Total equivalent global warming impact of R430A was found to be lower than that of R134a by about 7% due to its higher energy efficiency. The results confirmed that R430A is an energy efficient and environment-friendly alternative to R134a in domestic refrigerators.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"In India, many firms rely on their own generators, often diesel, as a secondary source of power to guard themselves against frequent outages in the national electricity grid. In 2003, the Government of India implemented a national reform to enhance the efficiency of the electricity grid. How did firm ownership of generators respond to this? We analyze data from the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys, with more than a thousand firms surveyed first in 2002 and then again in 2005 for generator ownership and potential explanatory variables. We show that although the use of generators decreased in the years following the reform, the response was heterogeneous. Large firms and exporters continued to rely on generators upon reform, while small firms and domestic producers reduced their reliance on diesel generators. These findings suggest that large firms and exporters value the insurance against outages that generators provide more than small firms and domestic producers. If India is to reduce the reliance on generators of key firms in the national economy, further improvements in the electricity sector are needed.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"In this paper we offer a decomposition analysis of changes in energy intensity in China for non-residential energy use. A combination of index decomposition analysis and structural decomposition analysis is conducted in this paper. Index decomposition analysis is used to decompose energy intensity changes between 2000 and 2009 into three factors: sectoral changes, subsectoral changes and technological changes as a residual variable. Of the three factors, technological change is the main reason why energy intensity, measured as energy use per GDP, fell. We also undertook a structural decomposition analysis for the period 2002–2005. We discovered that the temporary increase in energy intensity observed for 2002–2004 is caused by two factors: overcapacity and a shift towards energy-intensive products for domestic consumption and export.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"Exposure to fine particles ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) from incomplete combustion of solid fuels in household stoves is recognized as a major contributor to global ill health. Still there are few attempts to estimate the economic costs and health benefits of interventions to reduce exposure. The objective of this paper is to estimate costs and health benefits to women of possible interventions to replace current biomass stoves in Guizhou Province, southwest China, with cleaner burning stoves. Prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was measured in women ≥ 30 y living in households using biomass as fuel. In a sub-sample of households indoor PM2.5 concentrations were measured. Reduced exposure from replacing stoves in individual homes and at the community level was estimated using information about stoves, concentration levels, and time-activity patterns. Annual avoided new cases of COPD were estimated. The economic value of avoided cases was compared to intervention costs. Probabilistic cost-benefit analysis was performed using Monte-Carlo simulation and the impact of uncertainty in single parameters was explored. The mean reduction in annual average PM2.5 exposure is estimated at 127–294 μg/m3, which corresponds to a 41–77% reduction. Annually 0.6–3.2 new cases of COPD among women may be avoided per 1000 households. The present value net benefit is 1766–22,500 Yuan (Yuan/USD ≈ 0.16) per household and mean benefit/cost-ratios (B/C) are 3.3–14.7. We conclude that policy interventions to increase access to cleaner burning stoves may bring large net benefits to rural women and their families, and to society.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"Experiments were conducted to investigate the particle characteristics emitted from 10 wood types combusted in a traditional and an improved cookstove. The performance of the cookstoves has been assessed on the basis of their thermal efficiency using water boiling test (WBT). An aerosol spectrometer (GRIMM 1.108) was used for particulate matter sampling which provides real time data of size resolved particle concentrations. Variation in particle size distribution during different combustion phases was also analyzed. Particle size distribution (PSD) with respect to number, surface area and volume was studied to find out most dominant PM size range along with PM emission factors (EFs).Improved, top feed, cookstove was found to perform better than the traditional cookstove, both in terms of thermal efficiency and emissions. Around 99% of the particles were found in the fine range of 0.3–1 μm for both the cookstoves. Count median diameter (CMD) for improved cookstove was found to be 1.47 (with 3.76 as Geometric standard deviation (GSD)) as compared to 1.55 (with 3.73 as GSD) for the traditional cookstove, indicating a shift towards fine range particles. The total particle-number emission factor (TPNEF) and mass emission factor (MEF) for ten wood types were higher in traditional cookstove with an average value of 2.7 × 1013 kg− 1 and 6.17 g kg− 1 respectively. In case of improved cookstove TPNEF and MEF were found to be 7.6 × 1012 kg− 1and 0.72 g kg− 1 respectively indicating significant decrease in PM emissions. The size range of particles was also validated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by calculating actual size of the primary particles emitted from the combustion of a particular wood type. The findings of this study highlight the effect of cookstove design on resultant particle emissions and their distribution in various size ranges.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"This study examines the impact of rural electrification through extension of existing grid on rural micro-enterprises in Niger Delta, Nigeria. The study used purposive sampling and obtained data using structured questionnaires and personal interviews with the owners of the micro-enterprises. From the data, summary information was obtained and the impact of connection to grid-electricity on the micro-enterprises was examined using a log-linear regression model. The result shows that although not statistically significant, on average, enterprises in communities connected to the electricity grid are 16.2% more profitable than enterprises in communities not connected to the grid, and the use of generating sets in providing back-up electricity makes micro-enterprises more profitable. The study also observed that micro-enterprise owners are fully aware of the importance of electricity access to the profitability of their businesses and those who can afford to buy generating sets willingly do so. Incidentally, the total expenditure on generating sets by some enterprises is up to three times (3 ×) the tariff for grid-electricity in rural areas. The high cost of self-generated electricity increases the total cost of doing business in rural areas thus reducing the profit margin of the micro-enterprises. In conclusion, for rural electrification to be more effective in improving the living standard of rural dwellers, the larger problem of increasing the national generating capacity and the availability of grid-electricity should be tackled, and rural electrification programs should be carried out alongside other programs that reduce the barriers to establishing micro-enterprises like the creation of rural agricultural co-operatives to promote the productive use of electricity.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"Following more than 20 years of civil unrest, environmental information for Southern Somalia is scarce while there is clear evidence that the war economy fuelled by the conflict is rapidly depleting the country's natural resources and especially the woody biomass. Wood charcoal production is one of the most relevant businesses supporting war regimes such as the extreme Islamist group Al Shabaab, which has ruled in Southern Somalia from 2006 to 2012 and is still occupying large areas. In this study we map and quantify the tree loss suffered by the region due to the rapid increase in illegal charcoal production and export over recent years. Very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery is used to visually count charcoal production sites as a proxy of tree loss in two sample areas within the lower Juba region of Southern Somalia. The image interpretation allows mapping the charcoal production sites as well as estimating tree loss rates above 7% over 5 years. The results are crucial for understanding the exact dimension and effects of the loss of woody biomass and for planning conservation and recovery interventions in the concerned area.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"Phyllanthus emblica residues (PER) are unsuitable as a single substrate for biogas production because they usually contain residual tannins which are methanogenic inhibitors. In addition, the ratio of total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD) to nitrogen of 14:1 w/w in the PER is much lower than the value that is usually recommended. It is shown that a mixed substrate of PER and food waste has a tCOD to N ratio that is closer to recommended values and that co-digestion with this mixed substrate improves the yield of biogas. In this study, three lab-scale bioreactors were used to investigate (1) the single digestion of food waste, (2) the single digestion of the PER and (3) the co-digestion of food waste and PER at a mixing ratio of 11:1 g tCOD food waste/g tCOD PER. The organic loading rates (OLRs) of the co-digestion were 2.13, 2.83 and 4.26 g tCOD/L·day at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 40, 30 and 20 days, respectively. The OLR of the co-digestion was chosen to be equal to the sum of the OLRs of the single digestions. The methane production of the co-digestion was found to be greater than the sum of the methane production of the two single digestions by 12% at HRTs of 40 days and by 22% at HRT of 30 days. In addition, the methane yield of the co-digestion was higher than that of each of the single digestions. The co-digestion strategy was also applied to a pilot-scale 2000 liter-bioreactor that was usually used for treating food waste. It was found that the methane production was increased by 34% when the substrate was switched from food waste to the mixed food waste and PER co-substrate, and no signs of inhibition were observed.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean and Pacific have gone from a place of self-sufficiency and energy independence, during pre-colonial times, to a position, in more recent times, of being (often heavily) dependent on both imported capital (loans and aid) and imported sources of energy. This paper asserts that the current dependence of Caribbean and Pacific SIDS on both development assistance from donor agencies and imported fossil fuels is not coincidental, but rather, it was due to the transition of these islands from subsistence agriculture to export-oriented economies, primarily to serve the interests of more developed metropolitan countries. These interests have included the provision of cheap raw materials and agricultural produce to imperial nations; which has meant that SIDS needed to develop export orientated economies requiring both financial capital and energy supply usually over and above that available locally.The impact of colonisation on domestic energy use and demand in SIDS is thus briefly outlined so as to make clear how these nations transitioned from self-sufficiency to dependence on foreign capital and energy. It is upon this backdrop that the current dependence of SIDS on international aid, particularly with regards to the energy sector, has been analysed, along with its influence on energy policy in SIDS.This paper suggests that while imported finance and energy have been crucial to the past development of SIDS, the extent of reliance upon external financial assistance and energy imports at present is a cause for concern not only due to long term energy security issues but also because of the climate change implications of fossil fuel use. The concern is also pressing within the context of long term debt accumulation. It is argued herein that closer attention should be paid to local capacity building, training and institutional strengthening to enable a transition to renewable energy in place of fossil fuel based power. In terms of long term resilience such capacity building could eventually include the means for the production of renewable energy technology components.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"The aim of this study was to estimate the increase in industrial water consumption and withdrawal in a conventional sugarcane ethanol mill due to the introduction of second-generation ethanol production by a bagasse hydrolysis process, and to identify opportunities of water reuse, in order to minimize water withdrawal. Simulations in ASPEN PLUS® software were performed for mass and energy balances. Three cases were evaluated: a conventional ethanol production plant (Case I), and two second-generation plants incorporating bagasse hydrolysis differing only in their glucose concentration processes, namely by evaporation (Case II), and by membrane separation (Case III).Results show that external withdrawals of 738 L/t of cane for Case I, 955 L/t of cane for Case II and 853 L/t of cane for Case III are required to cover the water deficit of the plant. These values are lower than the mandated limit of 1000 L/t of cane for the sugar cane industry in the State of São Paulo. Moreover, for Cases II and III, which need large additional amounts of water for the hydrolysis stage, water usages of 10.77 and 9.38 L of water per litre of ethanol produced were achieved, approaching the figure of 9.34 L water per litre of ethanol produced by the conventional plants (Case I). This highlights the high potential for reduction practices based on the concept of energy and water integration.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"This paper discusses a basic problem in innovation studies, namely the allocation of scarce funds for governmental subsidies to market and R&D support, with the aim to effectively promote a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy technologies. Although various ideas on this exist, a general framework is lacking. We develop such a framework, discuss its relevance for various types of countries and examine which policies different countries have employed to promote renewable energy. We compare the strategies of Germany, with more focus on market instruments, of California, with a greater emphasis of R&D, and of China, characterized by central planning. In addition, we interpret the results of decomposition analyses using two factor learning curves. We draw conclusions about a desirable balance of subsidies and associated policies.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"Sugarcane is one of Brazil's most important industries, mainly because of ethanol, one of its products. Ethanol has a low production cost and low GHG emissions per unit of energy produced, as compared to other fossil fuels. However, several authors have expressed concern about the high water consumption expected in the coming years for biofuel production. This work presents a proposal to reduce water consumption in the industrial stage, taking into account demand and supply quality restrictions. A water supply mix is suggested, with direct reuse of 648 L/t of cane, and another 176 L/t of cane covered indirectly by recycled streams. This reduces the required external withdrawal to 405 L/t of cane — a value within the limit mandated for the sugarcane industry in the State of Sao Paulo.","Volume 17, Issue 5",October 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/5,33
"In Myanmar (Burma), only 13% of the country's population has access to electricity, and almost 95% depends on solid fuels such as wood and rice husks for cooking and heating. This review discusses four sets of energy poverty and access challenges in Myanmar related to poverty and subsistence needs, conflicting priorities, lack of resources, and policy fragmentation. Planners in Myanmar, however, can utilize a variety of mechanisms to overcome these challenges. They can offer financing and micro-financing for woodlots, nurseries, and renewable energy equipment. They can create community mobilization funds to promote women's empowerment and offer skills training. They can implement education and awareness campaigns for households and private sector entrepreneurs, and decentralize energy access programs to communities themselves. The government can promote public private partnerships for larger, grid-connected wind farms, large-scale hydroelectric dams, geothermal power plants, biomass power plants, waste-to-energy facilities, and liquid biofuel manufacturing facilities. Planners can harmonize regulatory authority for energy access to a single agency, establish national technology standards to ensure technical quality, and construct maintenance and training centers to ensure communities care for energy equipment.","Volume 17, Issue 4",August 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/4,34
"The Australian state of Western Australia could follow a number of different paths to satisfy its future energy needs with each path meeting different criteria for sustainable development. A number of energy use scenarios were analysed, including the present case of high fossil fuel use, in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, water consumption, and financial impact on households with incomes at different levels. Scenarios had different combinations of electricity generation sources and vehicle type. It was found that health costs from vehicle emissions are a significant cost of energy use for households relative to other costs (e.g., cost of fuel). Because of high income inequality and the effects of vehicle emissions on health, it was found that the most sustainable use of energy for society overall requires households to use energy differently according to their income levels. Low-median income households have the most to gain from overall electric vehicle uptake, but these same households cannot afford to adopt these vehicles. We show that the differential effects of current energy use on households with different income levels is increasing inequality between households, and that inequality both results from, and is a cause of unsustainable energy use. The conclusion is that income inequality is an obstacle to the uptake of electric vehicles, and can therefore be an obstacle to sustainable energy use.","Volume 17, Issue 4",August 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/4,34
"Access to affordable and renewable sources of energy is crucial to reducing poverty and enhancing rural development in countries of the global South. Straight vegetable oil was recently identified as a possible alternative to conventional biomass for rural energy supply. In this context, the Jatropha curcas Linn. species has been extensively investigated with regard to its potential as a biofuel feedstock. In contrast, only little is known about Jatropha mahafalensis Jum. & H. Perrier, which is an indigenous and endemic representative of the Jatropha genus in Madagascar. This paper explores the potential and suitability of J. mahafalensis as a biofuel feedstock. Seed samples were collected in the area of Soalara in south-western Madagascar in February and September 2011. Two agro-ecological zones (coastal area and calcareous plateau) and two plant age groups (below and above 10 years) were considered. These four sample groups were analyzed with regard to oil properties, element contents, and fatty acid profiles. Measured values differed greatly between the two harvests, probably owing to different climatic or storage conditions. No direct relation between age of trees or location and oil quality could be established. The analyses indicate that J. mahafalensis oil can be used in oil lamps, cooking stoves and stationary combustion engines for electrification or for biodiesel production. However, modifications in storage and extraction methods, as well as further processing steps are necessary to enable its utilization as a straight vegetable oil and feedstock for biodiesel production. If these technical requirements can be met, and if it turns out that J. mahafalensis oil is economically competitive in comparison with firewood, charcoal, paraffin and petroleum, it can be considered as a promising feedstock for rural energy supply.","Volume 17, Issue 4",August 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/4,34
"The effect of culture medium composition and cultivation time on biodiesel production by Rhizopus oryzae ATCC #34612 whole cell catalysts, immobilized on novel rigid polyethylene biomass supports, was investigated. Supplementation of the medium with carbon sources led to higher lipase activity and increased the biomass immobilized on the BSPs. Statistical analysis indicates that a cultivation period of 72 h in a basal medium supplemented with both cottonseed oil and glucose is optimal for biodiesel production by R. oryzae, resulting in a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield of 27.9 wt.% (228.2 g/L).","Volume 17, Issue 4",August 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/4,34
"Jatropha curcas has been introduced and sold as cook stove fuel in Indonesia since late 2010, after the progressive phasing-out of the subsidy for kerosene started in 2007. To review the reliability and probable health impacts of J. curcas Seed (JCS) stoves used for cooking, the standard water boiling test (WBT) was used to evaluate the stove's basic performance (thermal efficiency and specific fuel consumption) and the indoor air quality associated with its emissions and these parameters were compared with those of a traditional wood stove (WS). The emissions were analyzed using a CO monitor, photoelectric PM (particulate matter) monitors and the Sioutas Cascade Impactor to characterize the CO (carbon monoxide) concentration, temporal variations in PM mass concentrations and the mass size distributions from the stove emissions respectively.In general the JCS stove showed higher thermal efficiency and lower specific fuel consumption than the wood stove. Average indoor PM2.5 concentration at a cook site around a traditional wood stove was twelve times that around the JCS stove. Likewise, the JCS stove produced only about half of the indoor CO concentration compared to the wood stove emission. This suggests that replacing traditional wood stoves by JCS stoves reduces the exposure of cooks to PM2.5 and CO. Predominance of organic carbon in the collected aerosol 、during JCS stove combustion indicated that it resulted from the incomplete burning of organic matter in the seed. This study suggests that the JCS stove could be a promising substitute to the traditional wood stove. However the capacity of the stove, its re-fuelling method and tar produced should be improved and overcome to meet the practical needs of the rural cooking environment.","Volume 17, Issue 4",August 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/4,34
"The Rwandan government, in partnership with international donors, began its National Domestic Biogas Program (NDBP) in 2007. The NDBP, with an initial budget of $14.1 million, was to develop a commercially viable Rwandan biogas sector and build 15,000 family sized biogas plants throughout the country by 2011. As of August, 2012, however, the NDBP had installed only 2600 units. This study explores what happened. It introduces readers to the rural energy situation in Rwanda, describes the history and benefits of the NDBP, and then discusses the barriers that explain its limited success. These barriers include lack of familiarity with biogas technology, and minimal institutional capacity following the Rwandan genocide. Other challenges include inadequate suppliers and maintenance personnel, limited financing and the bulk of biogas digester costs befalling households, and an inadequate marketing and awareness campaign. The study concludes by noting that government support and collaboration with all relevant stakeholders and the development of private sector capacity is vital to the successful implementation of renewable energy technology. It also notes that market-oriented approaches to renewable energy sector development require consistent and sustained efforts on behalf of the international community and the public sector, and that promoting and extolling the benefits of a new technology can be essential to overcoming societal resistance.","Volume 17, Issue 4",August 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/4,34
"Road lighting facilities operate for over half of a year but they are permanently subjected to adverse weather conditions and environmental pollution. The major cause of the loss of light is generally the accumulation of dirt on the luminaires (lamps and lighting fixtures).The severity of the loss (depreciation) depends on the nature and density of environmental pollution and the degree of protection of the luminaires against dust and water. This depreciation is compensated, beginning from the design stage, by over-sizing facilities and, throughout its lifetime, by maintenance programs. There are several ways of estimating depreciation. This paper is a review of the different sources of information and findings of major investigations conducted in recent times. There is strong evidence which indicates that luminaire depreciation could be based on the level of sealing of the luminaires and on environment pollution categories. Luminaires with IP6X degree protection are only slightly influenced by environment pollution. New generations of LED luminaires are built to conform to IP6 and this will probably soon be the standard for road and urban lighting luminaires. Even if these luminaires have a higher rate of lamp survival, an exterior cleaning operation is still necessary and the luminaire depreciation behaviour model will still be useful. It is important to select a convenient maintenance factor to compensate for depreciation and to reduce the number of installed fixtures or the amount of over sizing of lamp power, which significantly transcends the energy and environmental impact.","Volume 17, Issue 4",August 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/4,34
"There are many advantages of solar photovoltaic technology in providing lighting for rural homes—scalability, minimal maintenance and well developed business models. This study seeks to study the impact of the transition from Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) to Light Emitting Diodes based lights (LED) on the solar home lighting system market. Changing the lighting fixtures from CFL to LED would lead to the requirement of smaller panels and batteries and consequently, a reduction in prices. Would this reduction significantly increase the adoption of these systems? Would the requirement for financing or government support change? To understand this changing landscape of the rural solar lighting industry, this study analyses the current products, distribution network, and operations of seven diverse solar firms operating in different parts of India. Four of these firms exclusively make LED based products – lanterns and small home lighting systems – and the rest have some LED based systems in their portfolio. There are several factors to be considered, product configuration, luminosity, price effects and service and maintenance. While the price reduction is found to be significant (about 20%), affordability may still remain an issue for poorer households. LED lighting allows for the introduction of plug and play systems, and reduces institutional requirements for installation and maintenance.","Volume 17, Issue 4",August 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/4,34
"In this paper, the implementation of biogas technologies in animal farms in Thailand and the government policies used to promote these technologies are presented. The Thai government has created a goal of achieving 14% of all energy needs from renewable resources by 2022. As a renewable technology, biogas has the potential to reduce Thailand's dependence on fossil fuels which make up over 90% of Thailand's electricity generation. An unfortunate by-product from animal farm waste is the greenhouse gas, methane. The benefits from capturing and utilizing this gas include increased electric generation, less odor in the local community, less greenhouse gas emissions, more revenue for farmers and production of raw fertilizer material. Thailand has the potential to produce over one billion m3 of biogas per annum from its agricultural industry alone. Current utilization is only 36% of this potential. This paper will briefly discuss the technology used to capture and use biogas from animal farms in Thailand. The effect of government policies on this technology deployment shall be discussed. This paper demonstrates how technology and policy need to work together in order to best provide a practical solution for energy problems. In 2012, greenhouse gases worth 1400 Gg CO2 equivalent were saved from entering the atmosphere from animal farms in Thailand.","Volume 17, Issue 4",August 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/4,34
"Tanzania currently suffers from a severe shortage of electricity with only 14% of the total population connected to the national grid, and access in rural areas below 2%. This article therefore analyzes an internationally sponsored energy development program for microhydro electrification in Tanzania to provide recommendations for how the country's rural energy sector can be improved. More specifically, it investigates the Mini-Grids Based on Small Hydropower Sources to Augment Rural Electrification program (MBSH for short), a $13.4 million effort backed by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Global Environment Facility, and national actors to build 3.2 megawatts (MW) of microhydro capacity from 2011 to 2014. After introducing readers to the study's research methods, primarily semi-structured interviews, and to Tanzania's energy background, the article details the design, stakeholders, and targets of the MBSH. It then presents four major challenges the MBSH must overcome to be successful: seasonal changes in hydroelectricity output, financial problems at the national electric utility TANESCO, historically low electricity tariffs, and high rates of poverty and electricity theft. The article concludes by calling on five sets of national reforms including the scaling up of pilot projects and increasing investment in microhydro projects.","Volume 17, Issue 4",August 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/4,34
"This study investigates the partial correlations between the share of new renewable electricity in a country and income, energy security and climate change mitigation. For the purpose of this paper, new renewables refer to the electricity generating technologies that have not yet reached grid-parity (e.g. wind, solar). The author proposes a measure of energy security depending on the role of inputs (coal and natural gas) in electricity generation as well as a measure of a country's potential to mitigate climate change based on the quantity of fossil-based electricity generated per capita. Findings from 2007, 2008 and 2009 data on 107 middle and high-income economies show that rich countries relying on coal imports to generate their power, are also those with the highest shares of electric power from new renewables.","Volume 17, Issue 4",August 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/4,34
"The aim of this study is to understand electricity supply from stand-alone mini-grid solar PV power stations in remote rural areas of western China from the perspective of ‘end-users’ including: their satisfaction, evaluation of sufficiency of electricity supply, positive experiences, negative experiences, behaviors, and needs. The methodology used for this study adopts the approach of an in-depth case study with field research. Two townships, Saierlong Township in Qinghai Province and Namcuo Township in Tibet Autonomous Region (AR), were selected for the case studies. The methods for collecting data are interviews and household surveys in the field. Based on end-users' experiences, the households in both investigated townships were not satisfied with the electricity service. The main concerns were the insufficiency of electricity supply and unreliable electricity service. The insufficiency of the electricity supply was due to lack of information about local household electricity needs. As for the issue of unreliable electricity service, electricity was not regularly supplied on a daily basis. The duration of daily electricity supply was also not stable. The households were unable to predict the starting and ending times of daily electricity supply. Hence, when planning rural electrification with stand-alone mini-grid solar PV power stations, end-users' electricity demand approach should be taken into consideration, instead of only electricity supply approach.","Volume 17, Issue 4",August 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/4,34

"In this paper, the testing of two different photovoltaic–thermal (PVT) modules under the tropical climatic conditions of Singapore, is evaluated. For this evaluation, two different types (Type A and Type B) of commercially available PVT modules have been installed and tested at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore. In Type A, the PV module is encapsulated with mono-crystalline Si solar cells and integrated with a tube-and-sheet type thermal collector, whereas, in Type B, the PV module is encapsulated with multi-crystalline Si solar cells and integrated with a parallel-plate type thermal collector. The performance of the PVT modules has been evaluated based on thermal and PV efficiencies.The experiments have been performed at different flow rates (0.03 kg/s and 0.06 kg/s) under typical day climatic conditions. The thermal performance of the modules has been validated using basic energy balance equations and design parameters. The temperature across the different layers of the PVT modules has been measured to study the heat flow pattern across the modules. It has been found that the average thermal efficiency and PV efficiency for Type A PVT module are 40.7% and 11.8%, respectively, and for Type B are 39.4% and 11.5%, respectively. The electrical efficiency of the PV modules was also compared with and without the thermal collector, and it was found that the average PV efficiency of the PVT modules is about 0.4% higher than the normal PV module.","Volume 17, Issue 1",February 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/17/issue/1,37
"There is a great need to provide energy to rural Africans in order to spark development and help to alleviate poverty. Although Jatropha curcas L. is no longer considered to be a miracle crop, and large scale Jatropha biofuel programs have struggled, Jatropha still has potential to be successfully used in small scale development projects. To this end, there has been a great deal of interest in Jatropha and studies have shown the potential of Jatropha to be used with multifunctional platforms (MFPs) to provide energy to rural sub-Saharan Africa. This is a review paper which examines research on the various aspects of using Jatropha and MFPs to provide energy to rural Africans. Neat Jatropha can be used as a fuel for the type of simple diesel engines used in MFPs. Jatropha oil can also be converted to biodiesel through esterification and/or transesterification. The Jatropha plant can be used in many other ways and its utility increases the value it can bring to a village. There are challenges to increase the use of Jatropha, and among the greater difficulties are land issues (a Jatropha plantation to provide enough oil to power an MFP for a rural village would probably require about 8 ha after 5 years of growth). Despite the challenges, Jatropha has been successfully used in some development projects and merits further research.","Volume 16, Issue 3",September 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/16/issue/3,39
"Biofuel is a fast growing sector in Tanzania. Foreign and domestic companies are acquiring big portions of land, some up to 440,000 hectares. It is believed that the country has a reserve of 88 million hectares for agriculture. The government is committed to promoting the sector. But what are the implications of biofuel plantations for rural development in Tanzania? This is an area of inquiry which has not received adequate attention. The main objective of the study was to investigate whether biofuel plantations will have any significant impact on rural development in Tanzania, using the case of Rufiji District. The choice of the district was fourfold. One, it has a considerable number of potential biofuel investors. Two, a high proportion of the investors intend to use the vertical integration model of production, processing and marketing. Three, the district is dominated by smallholder farmers, who are poor with chronic food insecurity. Four, Rufiji district is rich in biodiversity and natural resources. The findings from this study will reflect the likely impact of biofuel plantations on rural development as the selected district represents the characteristics of many rural areas of Tanzania. A total of 161 respondents were selected randomly for interview. There were also consultations with village governments, non-government organisations, policy makers and researchers. The findings show both high expectations and concerns. The respondents anticipate benefiting from employment, income-generating opportunities, access to markets for crops, and improved social services. More men than female respondents are hoping to become out-growers. However, male respondents in particular were concerned about land grabbing while for women it was about food security, water use conflicts and whether they will be able to access clean energy. The lack of a biofuel policy and legal framework as well as poor rural infrastructure may undermine the realisation of biofuel benefits.","Volume 16, Issue 3",September 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/16/issue/3,39
"An energy analysis of plantain production in a group of plantain plantations of a research institute was made in Nigeria. Data used in this study were collected in-situ on yearly basis; therefore the analyzed and discussed energy values were averages of data collected over the years. Total energy expenditure was 7.60 GJ/ha and energy output was 16.32 GJ/ha. The output/input energy ratio was 2.15. About 24% was generated by human labor, 41% from diesel oil and machinery, 28% from chemicals and fertilizers, while others contributed 7% of the total energy input. The total energy input could be classified as direct energy (about 61%), indirect energy (about 39%) and renewable energy (31%) and non-renewable energy (69%). Mean plantain yield was about 6000 kg/ha. The net energy and energy productivity value were estimated to be 8.72 GJ/ha and 0.79 kg/MJ, respectively. Cost analysis revealed that total cost of production of plantain was $3500/ha. Benefit–cost ratio was calculated as 1.69. Estimates have indicated that the energy potential of plantain residues (peels and trunks) is equivalent to energy of approximately 29 PJ or 0.69 million toe (tons of oil equivalent) of fuel-oil. There is therefore a very high potential of increasing the energy balance of plantain production if these residues are adequately harnessed either as biogas, ethyl alcohol, briquettes or for direct combustion.","Volume 16, Issue 3",September 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/16/issue/3,39
"Human development and electrical energy co-exist seamlessly in high Human Development Index (HDI) countries1 where reliability and availability of electricity is greater than 95%. In numerous low HDI countries,2 there is 5–50% electric grid availability. These electric grids can have reliability below 50% due to faults and extreme load shedding. Unavailable and unreliable electric grid events are situations disconnected from a centralized grid (if the grid fails then it is off-line). In Africa, renewable energy portfolios include solar, wind, biomass, biogas, small hydroelectric power and recently nuclear energy (MEMD, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009) and are cited to meet the disconnected grid situations. However, Human Power (HP) is a missing portfolio option and, if implemented in countries with average electrical power consumed below 20 W/Capita, would impact human development directly. The technologies include merry-go-round generators in schools, hand crank lighting in hospitals and health clinics during electricity outages and bicycle generators for off-grid businesses. This result is derived from (1) a new energy concept defined as PACE (People-based Activities Caloric Energy), (2) estimations from children's play — energy harvesting as free energy (3) disconnected-grid fuel costs for petrol and diesel generators, and (4) policy empowerment which is based on designing and building microgrids. These designs result from an innovative Physics and Business of Energy (PBE) curriculum, in conjunction with University of Michigan (USA), taught in Uganda at Mountains of the Moon University, Makerere University and St. Joseph's Technical Institute with an association called Uganda Small Scale Industries Association (USSIA). The HP-module is part of a multi-module curriculum for Empowering Ugandans to Power Uganda. The overall educational and design policies create a key missing gateway to co-designed and locally built microgrids. These policies are applicable in many, if not all, low HDI countries.","Volume 16, Issue 2",June 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/16/issue/2,40
"An indirect forced circulation solar water heating system using a flat-plate collector is modeled for domestic hot water requirements for the people living in Hadji-abad village. This project is designed using F-chart. The water heating load or the amount of energy required to warm water from the inlet cold water to a desired temperature, is dependent on several factors such as hot water consumption rate, cold water inlet and desired hot water set temperatures, location and orientation of the building. The system was installed to supply hot water for 12 showers and 4 private baths for a public bath complex to serve the hot water demands throughout the year for 150 people per day. The system was built in 2004 in the village of Hadji-abad near the city of Birjand in the eastern part of Iran. The installation is composed of two solar collector fields (195 m2) and two storage tanks (of 3 m3 capacity each). This paper emphasizes the factors associated with subsystems that are required to extract heat from 195 m2 solar collectors, store this heat in two thermally insulated hot water storage tanks and the heat distribution system with electrically operated pumps for water circulation. The results show that by utilizing solar energy, the designed system could provide the total hot water demands.","Volume 16, Issue 1",March 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/16/issue/1,41
"Indonesia is the third largest producer of cocoa bean in the world. One of the residues produced after removal of the cocoa bean from the fruit is cocoa pod husk (CPH).

Five grams mixture of CPH and binder in the proportion of 70% and 30% by weight respectively was pelletized and dried at 50 °C for 5 hours. Carbonization was performed at 400 °C for 2 hours. The results show that CPH has a high heating value of 17.0 MJ/kg. The air flow rate and fuel composition significantly affected the burning time and CO emission factor. The increase of carbonized CPH portion in the fuel increased the burning time of the pellet. The increase of air flow rate and carbonized CPH portion also increased the emission factor of CO.","Volume 16, Issue 1",March 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/16/issue/1,41
"This paper aims to shed light on the nexus of electricity, firm performance, and economic development in a dynamic rural area in Southern Uganda. Using quantitative firm-level data on 200 micro-enterprises complemented by qualitative case studies we find that modern energy increases the importance of electricity-using capital and alters the sectoral distribution of economic activities. By contrast, we find no evidence for an expansionary effect of electrification on firm profits or worker remuneration. In fact, many entrepreneurs consider the direct gain from connecting to the grid to be small. Qualitative information, however, suggests that a positive indirect impact of electrification on firm performance is induced by the overall expansive effect electrification has on local demand. The demand increase can be partly assigned to people moving into the electrified community from surrounding non-electrified areas. We conclude that if productive energy promotion policies are put in place they should address drawing up thorough business plans to enable local entrepreneurs to take informed connection and investment decisions.","Volume 15, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/15/issue/1,45
"Renewable energy can potentially play a role in the supply of safe water in Bangladesh, where nearly 70% of the rural population does not have access to electricity. This paper examines the possible application of renewable energy for pumping water from geologically safe deep tubewells to overcome limitations in existing water technologies in the arsenic-contaminated villages in Bangladesh. Renewable energy, national grid electricity, and alternatives such as diesel engines have been considered as sources of power for both suction and submersible pumps in electrified and non-electrified villages. Three locally available renewable energy sources (human energy, biogas, and solar energy) have been assessed as power sources for reciprocating and submersible pumps. These renewable energy options have not been found cost competitive with the deep tubewells which run off the national grid in electrified villages. However, electricity generated from biogas has the potential to power submersible pumps in non-electrified villages. This paper discusses some financial mechanisms to promote capital-intensive energy options for deep tubewells in arsenic-affected rural areas.","Volume 15, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/15/issue/1,45
"Cashew nut shells are high energy content residues from cashew nut processing. It can potentially replace fuelwood for thermal application in a factory. However, direct combustion of cashew nut shells was troublesome due to low efficiency and high smoke emission. Alternative thermal conversion of cashew nut shells should be used instead. In this work, a gasifier system was designed, built, and installed at a local cashew nut processing factory. Cashew nut shells were converted to producer gas in the downdraft fixed-bed gasifier. The gaseous fuel was then fed to a burner to supply hot water for the factory. From the results obtained, cashew nut shells were successfully used as feedstock in a gasifier. Satisfactory operation was obtained. Gasification of cashew nut shells could provide required thermal input, with clean fuel to the local food processing factory. Preliminary economic analysis showed that the factory can save around $150 a month, with simple period to positive cash flow of less than a year.","Volume 15, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/15/issue/1,45
"Technology assessment has changed in nature over the last four decades from an analytical tool for technology evaluation, which depends heavily on quantitative and qualitative modelling methodologies, into a strategic planning tool for policy making concerning acceptable new technologies, which depends on participative policy problem analysis. The goal of technology assessment today is to generate policy options for solutions of organizational and societal problems, which, at the operational level, utilize new technologies that are publicly acceptable, that is, viable policy options. This study focuses on the development of a framework that incorporates a technology assessment approach, namely, system dynamics, within the broader scope of technology development for sustainability. The framework, termed system approach to technology sustainability assessment (SATSA), integrates three key elements: technology development, sustainable development, and dynamic systems approach. The article then demonstrates the framework of incorporating the system dynamics methodology in energy technology assessment theory and practice within the context of sustainable development. The framework provides for technology sustainability assessment, which, in turn, can guide the promotion of sustainable energy technologies at a policy level. In addition, it can assist technology developers in understanding the potential impacts of a technology, hence enabling them to reduce technology transfer risks.","Volume 15, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/15/issue/1,45
"A fee on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, applicable equally to all nations and based on the quantity of fossil fuels used in each country, is proposed. Fees would be paid into a UNFCCC-administered fund. Fees would be distributed to nations, according to population, for use in climate change mitigation or adaptation. Advantages and disadvantages of the fee scheme and its effects on various groups of nations are discussed. About 40% of the fees would be net transfers from developed nations to developing nations; 60% of fees would return to their country of origin. Concessions to major fuel exporters may be appropriate. Historical emissions could be included in the fee scheme. A fee provides disincentives to inefficient industrial operations, regardless of location, and avoids trade inequities inherent in unequal national emission caps. Project-based emission reductions of the Clean Development Mechanism could be continued by using fees to buy CERs. A fee scheme would be simpler than alternative climate change treaty proposals but presents problems regarding the appropriate fee level, efficient and fair management of funds, perverse incentives to increase GHG emissions through biofuels production, and political acceptability in nations having greater than average per capita GHG emissions.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/4,46
"We briefly consider the trend towards relying on the tools, systems and resources of national energy policy to meet international climate change mitigation goals. Within this paradigm, the myriad energy-related aspects of climate change policy should be explicitly addressed as a sub-set of energy policy rather than the reverse, with the positive goal of building a low-carbon economy rather than the negative task of reducing emissions. While international signals on global targets for climate change mitigation are valuable, they will only be realised if “grounded” into specific policy sectors that address core objectives of society (like security of energy service delivery). Various facets of energy policy from the geo-politics of the global trade in fossil fuels, to development of renewable energy technologies, to national power system planning and operation lend themselves to this approach. It remains the case that modifying the goals of energy policy to encompass delivery of climate goals will require a change in focus of energy decision-makers and institutions.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/4,46
"Greenhouse gas emissions inventories provide a baseline to develop mitigation projects for reducing emissions. However, a detailed inventory of livestock gas emissions is not available for Ecuador. This study attempts to fill this gap. The methodology selected comes from the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines to quantify emissions from the livestock sector. Tier 1 methodology was implemented using animal census data for the year 2000, and historical temperature data by province. The total methane emissions from enteric fermentation were 5596 GgCO2Eq. Methane emissions from manure came mainly from cattle and swine with 92.4 and 44.3 GgCO2Eq, respectively, and a livestock total of 182 GgCO2Eq. The total direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from manure management were 172 GgCO2Eq, and total direct and indirect N2O emissions from manure deposited on soils by grazing livestock were 2176 GgCO2Eq. A further 103 GgCO2Eq of direct N2O emissions came from the application of confined-livestock manure to soils. We estimated the total potential reductions in emissions from capturing methane gas from anaerobic digestion of dairy, swine and poultry manure and substituting methane for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at 308 GgCO2Eq. The value of the methane produced could amount to US$ 77 M. Alternatively, that same methane gas could be used to generate 275 GWh of electricity. Additional benefits from anaerobic digestion of manure include the recovery of nutrients from the digested effluent, which could be used as biofertilizer and soil amendment. The capture of these greenhouse gases and the use of anaerobic digesters to produce energy and other products seem to have potential in Ecuador. However, lack of experience with anaerobic digestion and biogas production is a great limitation for the implementation of this technology. Also, anaerobic digester designs should be evaluated and modified to fit local needs given the variability of climatic and socio-economic conditions across the country.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/4,46
"Solar aided feedwater heating (SAFWH) appears to be a prospective option for using solar thermal energy in existing or new coal-fired thermal power plants. This article deals with the 4-E (namely energy, exergy, environment, and economic) analysis of solar thermal aided coal-fired power plants to establish their techno-economic viability. An operating coal-fired subcritical (SubC) and the first supercritical (SupC) power plant being commissioned in India are considered as reference power plants for SAFWH. The 4-E analysis is reported assuming operation of coal-fired power plants with SAFWH for 8 h/day in either fuel conservation or power boosting mode. An instantaneous reduction of about 14–19% in coal consumption is observed by substituting turbine bleed streams to all the feedwater heaters including deaerator with SAFWH in “fuel conservation mode”. The substitution of turbine bleed stream to high pressure feedwater heater alone with SAFWH results in about 5–6% instantaneous improvement in coal consumption and additional power generation for the fuel conservation and power boosting modes, respectively compared with the same values in reference power plants. The annual savings in fuel cost alone correspond to Indian Rupee (INR) 73.5–74.5 millions. The performance of solar thermal aided coal-fired power plants is also measured in terms of energy and exergy performance index and it is observed that the utilization of solar energy for feedwater heating is more efficient based on exergy rather than energy. The environmental analysis shows that about 62,000 and 65,000 t of CO2 are reduced annually from 500 MWe SubC and 660 MWe SupC coal-fired power plants, respectively using the best possible SAFWH option. However, the cost/tonne of CO2 avoided is about 7775–8885 and 8395–9790 INR (~ 200 USD) for solar thermal aided coal-fired SubC and SupC power plants, respectively far higher than the most mitigation measures under consideration today. Furthermore, SAFWH is found to be a not very cost effective measure based on the cost of saved fuel (coal).","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/4,46
"The differences between the Common but Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR) principle and the Equal Treatment for All Ships principle create a stalemate for future policy progress in vessel-based CO2 emissions reduction negotiations. This paper investigates the economic costs of CO2 emissions reduction with and without considering the CBDR under two separate regulatory scenarios, evaluates the impact on trade cost, and discusses the real policy concerns of developing countries insisting that the CBDR be applied by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). This paper shows that the cost increases to large developing countries are small even using a very stringent estimate. However, a policy that requires all ships to reduce CO2 emissions increases international trade costs for small-island nations significantly, presenting an equity issue to be resolved. The current proposal to rebate money to developing countries has merit, especially for small countries. It does not address some fundamental concerns of major developing countries, however. To engage these countries, their interests have to be secured and some new policies should be created. This paper proposes some policy options that may involve these countries and consolidate an international effort in the IMO to reach binding agreements to reduce ship-based CO2 in the future.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/4,46
"An emerging class of renewable energy technology, the hydrokinetic conversion device (HCD), offers ways to capture the energy of flowing water without the impoundment or diversion of the conventional hydroelectric facilities based on dams and penstocks. Hydrokinetic technologies are designed for deployment in natural streams, like rivers, tidal estuaries, ocean currents, and also in some constructed waterways (e.g. canals). In ocean-energy deployment, hydrokinetic conversion devices can be flexibly arranged into multi-unit arrays, which would extract energy from tidal and marine currents basically in the same way as a wind farm.This article focuses on recent advances and trends in hydrokinetic system development that may lead to a feasible future scenario for hydrokinetic power. The basic principles of HCDs are explained, and early experiences in the field described. With the help of technical reports, papers, proceedings and websites, we then review existing and emerging technologies in the HCD field. Innovation in mooring, and power transmission systems are also covered.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/4,46
"There are few solar water heaters in Africa because of their acquisition cost, which makes it difficult for the populations to afford them. This article presents a solar water heater designed with a local vegetable material as insulating material, coconut coir, widespread in tropical countries. The study focuses on the comparative thermal performance of this collector and another collector, identical in design, fabrication, and operating under the same conditions, using glass wool as heat insulation, as well as with eight other designs, chosen randomly, using various materials as heat insulation, with performance data from the literature.The materials cost of the coconut coir collector is 25% less than the glass wool one. The results of the study show very good thermal performance of the collector using coconut coir compared to the traditional ones. For example, the outlet hot water temperature of the coconut coir collector was more than 80 °C. Internal hot water temperature rise was more than 40 °C. The thermal efficiency was a little over 51% although it was generally below 50% for the collectors using traditional insulation. It has a good pair of values of FR(τα) and FRUL. So, the lower cost of this type of solar water heater and its performance suggest that this design may be more suitable for application in tropical countries where coconut coir is commonly available.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/4,46
"Wind and solar power generation is growing quickly around the world, mainly to mitigate some of the negative environmental impacts of the electricity sector. However, the variability of these renewable sources of electricity poses technical and economical challenges when integrated on a large scale. Energy storage is being widely regarded as one of the potential solutions to deal with the variations of variable renewable electricity sources (VRES). This paper presents an up-to-date review of the state of technology, installations and some challenges of electrical energy storage (EES) systems. It particularly focuses on the applicability, advantages and disadvantages of various EES technologies for large-scale VRES integration. This survey paper indicates that each challenge imposed by VRES requires a different set of EES characteristics to address the issue, and that there is no single EES technology that consistently outperforms the others in various applications. This paper also discusses external factors, such as mineral availability and geographic limitations, that may affect the success of the widespread implementation of EES technologies.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/4,46
"Energy conservation has emerged as the most prudent means of deferring capacity expansion of utility generation and power delivery infrastructure. This is particularly critical in the era of climate change coupled with erratic fuel prices and poor security of supplies. The dilemma, however, is the potential negative impact that conservation programs can have on the sustainable operation of utilities through lost revenues. For example, in South Africa the power utility Eskom recently (January 2010) requested for a 35% tariff increase (per annum for 3 years). Their stated goal was to raise capital for new power generation plant and delivery infrastructure through the sale of energy. This problem has been identified in much of the developed world particularly over the past 20 years. Various tariff models to decouple utility profitability from increased sales volumes have been proposed and legislated. Each solution, however, has advantages and shortcomings and their viability is often context dependent. In this paper a number of models that have been tried elsewhere are discussed. The author then suggests options that might be suitable for South Africa.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/4,46
"In this study, the installation objectives and impacts of Turkey's two major multidam transboundary hydropower projects, Southeastern Anatolia (Euprathes and Tigris Rivers) and Northeastern Anatolia (Coruh River) Projects, are discussed. Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) having 22 dams and 19 hydropower plants is the large-scale water management program aiming to increase the domestic electricity production and develop vast irrigation schemes for agriculture. Coruh River is the longest river in the east Black Sea region, having high economic importance to Turkey because of its largely undeveloped but economically exploitable hydropower potential. Coruh multiple dams project consists of 27 planned dams and hydroelectric power plants. Besides numerous expected benefits from these projects, also a multitude of substantial social, economic, and environmental impact potentials exist.In spite of numerous social and economic benefits experienced in the area in social and economic spheres due to the project, there is also a multitude of adverse impacts observed in the environment. In social and economic spheres, the land acquisition and resettlement of people are important issues. Large-scale irrigation causes salinization and leads to soil erosion; huge water reservoirs affect local climate and are a source of considerable amounts of pollution, including greenhouse gases. Changes in land use pattern carry potential to deprive plants and animals of their natural habitat. Moreover, urbanization and industrialization, following social and economical development, bring about increased pollution levels, degrading air and water quality.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/4,46
"Sustainable Development (SD) has been discussed extensively in the theoretical literature since the concept was adopted as an overarching goal of economic, social development and environmental protection. The relationship between SD and climate change is of particular importance to developing countries due to their development process and the particular climate challenges that many of them face. The notion is that strategies pursuing SD and climate change mitigation can be mutually reinforcing. In the frame of climate change, the transfer of low-carbon sustainable technologies could ideally provide a framework of helping developing countries to find new sustainable development paths. The aim of this paper is to present a Linguistic Decision Support Approach, based on the Linguistic Ordered Weighted Averaging (LOWA) operator, with the objective of assessing developing countries' energy service needs and priorities. In our approach, a range of energy services and criteria for the assessment were defined, related stakeholders were also involved so as to identify energy service needs and priorities that are most applicable to the country's sustainable development. In this respect, the approach followed could enhance the so far applied Technology Needs Assessments (TNA) and establish a clear understanding of the host country's overall medium to long-term energy and environmental strategy. The application of the particular approach to cross representative developing countries around the world indicated energy efficiency in industry and electricity for industry as high priority energy services.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/4,46
"Transesterified vegetable oil (biodiesel) has recently attracted enormous attention all over the world as an alternative fuel for diesel engines because of its renewability. Biodiesel can be produced from renewable sources such as vegetable oil, animal fat and used cooking oil. Currently, the cost of biodiesel is high as compared to conventional diesel oil because most of the biodiesel is produced from pure vegetable oil. However, the cost of biodiesel can be reduced by using low cost feedstock such as animal fat and used cooking oil. This paper reviews the work that has already been done in technologies for biodiesel production from used cooking oil. The fuel properties of biodiesel from used cooking oil were also reviewed and compared with conventional diesel oil. In addition, biodiesel specifications provided by different countries were also presented.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/4,46
"Improved cooking stove projects in the developing world have the potential to reduce deforestation, improve health, and slow climate change. To meet these requirements, stoves must be carefully designed through thorough testing and verification of performance. The systematic investigation of the heat transfer and combustion efficiency of stove design in the laboratory sheds light on what technologies work best and helps to ensure that stoves being disseminated are truly a significant improvement over traditional cooking methods.Performance of 50 different stove designs was investigated using the 2003 University of California-Berkeley (UCB) revised Water Boiling Test (WBT) Version 3.0 to compare the fuel use, carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) emissions produced. While these laboratory tests do not necessarily predict field performance for actual cooking, the elimination of variables such as fuel, tending, and moisture content, helps to isolate and compare the technical properties of stove design. Stoves tested fell under 7 main categories: simple stoves without combustion chambers, stoves with rocket-type combustion chambers, gasifier stoves, fan-assisted stoves, charcoal-burning stoves, liquid/gas fuel stoves, and wood-burning stoves with chimneys. A carefully made three-stone fire was also tested for comparison. Results showed that:•Stoves without well-designed combustion chambers may reduce fuel use in comparison to the three-stone fire but do not necessarily decrease and can potentially increase emissions of CO and PM.•Rocket-type stoves can reduce fuel use by 33%, CO emissions by 75%, and PM emissions by 46% on average in comparison to the three-stone fire.•Use of a pot skirt can reduce fuel use and emissions by 25–30%.•When operating well, gasifier stoves can reduce particulate matter substantially, averaging 90% improvement over the three-stone fire.•Five forced air stoves reduced fuel use by an average of 40% and emissions by 90% over the three-stone fire.•Traditional charcoal stoves use about the same amount of energy as the three-stone fire to complete a task (not counting the energy lost in making the charcoal, which can be as much as 70%) and produce up to two times more carbon monoxide and 80% less PM. A rocket-type charcoal stove can reduce this energy consumption by one third and CO emission by at least one half.•Liquid fuels generally exhibit less energy use and emissions. Kerosene can emit higher levels of PM than some improved wood stoves when not operating properly.•Well-designed stoves with chimneys remove smoke from the kitchen while fuel use is generally directly related to how much of the pot is in direct contact with the flames.From this data, it was possible to recommend benchmarks of improved cookstove performance. Benchmarks were suggested at levels that were achievable using known materials and manufacturing techniques, yet still aspirational, ensuring each stove design is carefully tested and optimized for highest efficiencies. It is hoped that these benchmarks can be used as the first step toward international performance standards for cooking stoves. Five of the stoves presented here were also tested at the US EPA, with results agreeing within 20% or better on all fuel and emissions measures, suggesting standard evaluation at various locations is possible.","Volume 14, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/3,47
"This paper presents the results of two studies conducted to evaluate the performance and usability of household biomass cookstoves under field conditions in rural sub-Saharan Africa. Cooking tests and qualitative surveys compared improved, manufactured stove models based on the ‘rocket’ design with the traditional three-stone fire. All tests and interviews took place in household kitchens in two village areas in Western Uganda and Western Tanzania. The performance parameters evaluated in cooking tests were specific fuelwood consumption and cooking time. Surveying of household cooks gathered information about prevailing cooking practices, stove preference and usability, and willingness to pay for novel stove types. Test results showed that the manufactured stoves, in general, yield a substantial reduction in specific fuelwood consumption relative to the three-stone fire, with results varying by stove type and type of food cooked. Survey data suggests that while cooks recognize fuelwood savings as an important benefit, overall stove preference depends upon a combination of this and other factors, including cooking time, stove size and ease of use. These findings highlight the importance of testing multiple cookstoves for preparation of a variety of food items, as well as combined use of quantitative stove tests in combination with qualitative surveys in efforts to determine suitability of cookstoves for household use in a given community.","Volume 14, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/3,47
"Cooking tests were conducted in randomly selected school kitchens in the Sauri Millennium Villages Project site, located in Siaya District of Nyanza Province in Western Kenya. The tests compared fuel consumption measurements obtained using a traditional three-stone fire with those from newly introduced institutional stoves based on the “rocket” design. The key metric used was Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), defined as the weight of firewood consumed in cooking a single batch of food divided by the total weight of food, measured after cooking. Tests followed the normal cooking practices in the school kitchens and included the typical range of foods prepared for midday school meals programs. The study included two types of tests: paired tests, in which most conditions were controlled between one test conducted on a three-stone fire and a matching test conducted on a “rocket” stove; and unpaired tests, in which conditions were similar, but not strictly controlled, among two large sets of relatively independent three-stone fire and rocket stove tests. Results from both paired and unpaired experiments, averaged across all types of food cooked, showed that the use of rocket stoves yielded significantly lower SFC values without prolonging cooking time when compared with three-stone fires. An analysis comparing results from paired and unpaired cooking tests suggests that, due to high variance and sources of bias in unpaired tests, experimental design should favor paired tests.","Volume 14, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/3,47
"The bioenergy has been greatly deliberated in Brazil. This has led the country to develop new policies and implement a biodiesel program (PNPB) in 2004 aiming at fostering the rural development and at the same time promoting a new and clean source of energy. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing international debate about the negative impacts of bioenergy, especially biofuels, such as, the consequences to native forests and on local food production. In this context, the present study aims to assess the relationship between small-scale oil seed activity and food production, as well as, with the deforestation of native forests. A cross-sectional study was conducted with small-scale farmers in the Brazilian savannah, in a transitional region between the Cerrado and the Amazon rain forest. A range of socio-economic and environmental indicators were collected among smallholders who cultivate Jatropha curcas and Ricinus communis and from them different scenarios were established, which estimated the impacts on climate change and on local food production due to oil seed activity. The results point towards a positive relationship between oil seed production and deforestation and a negative relationship between oil seed activity and local food production. The latter result, therefore, exacerbates local food insecurity. The research is unprecedented in the region and the results can be extremely effective in supporting regional and national government subsidies on clean energy that do not harm the local environment or food production; helping Brazil achieve regional sustainable development.","Volume 14, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/3,47
"This paper reviews the current state of biomass potential studies, discusses the essential driving factors for energy crop potentials and shows the results of a scenario analysis for worldwide energy crop potentials till 2050. The results of previous potential estimates vary widely. A comparison of 19 different assessments showed energy crops potentials ranging from 0 EJ/yr to 1272 EJ/yr in 2050. However, relatively little information is available for the short and mid-term perspective (2020 and 2030). As an increasing demand of energy crops can be expected, the energy crop potentials for 133 individual countries are calculated on the premise that food demand takes priority. Applying a scenario approach with three different scenarios for the years 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2050 the resulting potential changes in a “business as usual” development from 27 EJ in 2010 to 96 EJ in 2050. In comparison, the “sustainable land use” scenario shows much lower potentials with 18 EJ in 2010 and 16 EJ in 2050. The “environment and health” scenario finally produces an almost stable worldwide energy crop potential in the order of 40 EJ for the investigated timeframe.","Volume 14, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/3,47
"An international partnership between Canada and China was established to improve performance and reduce emissions from coal-fired utility boilers. A well-tested computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling tool was used to identify the improvement strategies for 11 selected units ranging from 200 to 600 MWe, to increase operation availability and realize the reduction of coal consumption, acid rain precursor NOX and green house gas CO2 emissions. Sustainability measures were introduced to promote replication of project results by the Chinese partners to maximize impact beyond the duration of the project. It is estimated that the study results could potentially be extended to 23% of the 2005 coal-based power generation capacity in China to achieve significant CO2 emissions reduction prior to implementing advanced clean coal technologies like Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and oxy-coal combustion with CO2 capture.","Volume 14, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/3,47
"A large part of the world's population, particularly in India and Africa, lives in villages that often lie beyond the reach of grid power supply. Isolated power systems, which generate power at site, are considered as a viable option for the electrification of these areas. This paper discusses Indian experiences of isolated power systems. In India, there are many villages which have been electrified through renewable isolated power plants like biomass gasifier and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Case studies have been conducted for three such isolated power plants in the state of Maharashtra, India. It is observed from these case studies that the existing power plants are oversized and have a potential for reduction in distribution losses. This paper proposes an integrated design method for isolated power system, which combines load modeling, sizing and optimum distribution network. The levelized unit cost of energy can be reduced by 25–50% for the case studies by adopting the integrated design methodology. Generic guidelines are evolved for systems design from the case studies of sample isolated power systems.","Volume 14, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/3,47
"Micro-enterprises are a key component in rural enterprise creation and income generation. In rural areas far removed from grid-electricity, public solar photovoltaic (PV) electrification projects have served useful purposes by contributing to improve the economic activities of micro-enterprises beyond daylight hours. Through fee-for-service approach some rural micro-enterprises in Ghana were provided with access to solar PV systems to enhance their output. It is expected that the effect of solar PV electrification on enterprise output would be of research interest. However, the relationship is under-researched. Hence, there is lack of data particularly quantitative ones to show the benefits that can be derived from the sustainable use of solar PV to electrifiy rural micro-enterprises. Using systematic sampling and developing a set of enterprise-level indicators, micro-enterprises with and without solar PV were surveyed in eight rural communities in five regions of Ghana. The results revealed that the cost avoided by using solar PV in the enterprises instead of kerosene lanterns was US$1–5/month. The results established a statistically significant association between solar PV lighting and additional income after sunset of US$ 5–12/day in grocery (merchandise) enterprises. Without the external lighting of solar-electrified enterprises, the businesses of about two night vendors were affected. Further to the impacts on income and cost savings the study discussed affordability, factors preventing the extension of working hours after sunset and sustainability issues.","Volume 14, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/3,47
"The paper analyzes the performance of a set of rural Micro Hydro Power (MHP) projects and MHP-implementing organizations in Bolivia, using a learning-based analytical perspective. Rather than identifying a generic set of critical success factors such as access to finance, adequate technological support and management capabilities, project success is viewed as something that results from people's motivation to keep tackling barriers that impede the functioning of their system. Furthermore, the research points up the key importance of encouragement and support of such local de-bottlenecking activities by the MHP-implementing organizations. Interaction with user communities on a long-term basis and inculcation of local project ‘ownership’ through system co-construction and co-improvement are found to be crucial elements in effective institutional support. In order to perform well, the organizations themselves also have to practice continuous performance improvement through learning, and they need to foster the wider exchange of lessons in the MHP sector in the country as a whole. These findings appear to have wider relevance than the Bolivian MHP case as such, and hold important lessons for project implementers and policy makers involved in rural electrification.","Volume 14, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/3,47
"The majority of rural residents in China are dependent on traditional fuels, but the quality and quantity of existing data on the process of fuel switching in rural China are insufficient to have a clear picture of current conditions and a well-grounded outlook for the future. Based on an analysis of a rural household survey data in Hubei province in 2004, we explore patterns of residential fuel use within the conceptual framework of fuel switching using statistical approaches. Cross-sectional data show that the transition from biomass to modern commercial sources is still at an early stage, incomes may have to rise substantially in order for absolute biomass use to fall, and residential fuel use varies tremendously across geographic regions due to disparities in availability of different energy sources. Regression analysis using logit and tobit models suggest that income, fuel prices, demographic characteristics, and topography have significant effects on fuel switching. Moreover, while switching is occurring, the commercial energy source which appears to be the principal substitute for biomass in rural households is coal. Given that burning coal in the household is a major contributor to general air pollution in China and to negative health outcomes due to indoor air pollution, further transition to modern and clean fuels such as biogas, LPG, natural gas and electricity is important. Further income growth induced by New Countryside Construction and improvement of modern and clean energy accessibility will play a critical role in the switching process.","Volume 14, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/3,47
"India has recently launched the National Biomass Cookstoves Initiative (NCI) to develop next-generation cleaner biomass cookstoves and deploy them to all Indian households that currently use traditional cookstoves. The initiative has set itself the lofty aim of providing energy service comparable to clean sources such as LPG but using the same solid biomass fuels commonly used today. Such a clean energy option for the estimated 160 million Indian households now cooking with inefficient and polluting biomass and coal cookstoves could yield enormous gains in health and welfare for the weakest and most vulnerable sections of society. At the same time, cleaner household cooking energy through substitution by advanced-combustion biomass stoves (or other options such as clean fuels) can nearly eliminate the several important products of incomplete combustion that come from today's practices and are important outdoor and greenhouse pollutants. Using national surveys, published literature and assessments, and measurements of cookstove performance solely from India, we find that about 570,000 premature deaths in poor women and children and over 4% of India's estimated greenhouse emissions could be avoided if such an initiative were in place today. These avoided emissions currently would be worth more than US$1 billion on the international carbon market. In addition, about one-third of India's black carbon emissions can be reduced along with a range of other health- and climate-active pollutants that affect regional air quality and climate. Although current advanced biomass stoves show substantial emissions reductions over traditional stoves, there is still additional improvement needed to reach LPG-like emission levels. We recognize that the technology development and deployment challenges to meet NCI goals of this scale are formidable and a forthcoming companion paper focuses on what program design elements might best be able to overcome these challenges.","Volume 14, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/2,48
"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production of the 21 major field crops in Canada were 16.8 Tg CO2e of N2O and 17.2 Tg of fossil fuel CO2 in 2006. The mean GHG emission intensity on an area basis for these crops was 1.0 Mg of CO2e per ha. On a dry matter (DM) basis, the mean GHG emission intensity was 0.33 Mg of CO2e Mg−1 DM. For western Canada, the GHG emission intensity was 0.35 MgCO2e Mg− 1 DM and 0.30 MgCO2e Mg− 1 DM for eastern Canada. The sensitivity of the GHG emissions to crop-specific GHG emission intensities was demonstrated by examining two biodiesel scenarios. The biodiesel share of the diesel fuel blend was 2% in the first scenario (B2) and 5% in the second scenario (B5). The increased feedstock was assumed to come from canola and soybeans. The B2 scenario increased the emission intensity for western Canada to 0.38 MgCO2e Mg− 1 DM and the B5 scenario to 0.43 MgCO2e Mg− 1 DM. Neither scenario had any appreciable effect on the magnitude of the emission intensity for eastern Canada. The GHG emissions from the canola-dominated western Canadian field crops were increased by the B2 and B5 fuel blend scenarios. In the soybean-dominated east, the two scenarios resulted in decreased GHG emissions from field crops. Canola-based biodiesel potentially eliminates more petrodiesel CO2 emissions than soybean biodiesel. However, for both scenarios, the net potential GHG reductions (petrodiesel offset plus change in GHG emissions from field crops) were 2.60 MgCO2e ha−1 of additional oilseeds in the east and 0.94 MgCO2e ha− 1 in the west. The higher meal by-product from soybean oil meant a smaller loss of livestock feed for eastern Canada.","Volume 14, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/2,48

"This paper analyses energy efficiency development in the German and Colombian textile industries as case studies, using three alternative indicators to measure energy efficiency performance. The study analyses energy efficiency in the textile industry at the ISIC three-digit level of aggregation for the years 1998 to 2005. Comparing the results of the three alternative indicators, the German and Colombian textile industries improved their energy efficiency performance during the sample period. The energy consumption of each textile manufacturing activity corresponded to its production level, indicating the direct relation between output and energy use. The results show considerable variation in energy efficiency between the German and Colombian textile industries. A second-stage application of the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function reveals that in the German textile industry, capital and energy price variables enhance the efficiency of the gross production–energy ratio, whereas in the Colombian textile industry, labour, materials, and plant capacity utilisation variables enhance the efficiency of the gross production–energy ratio. Moreover, in the German textile manufacturing activities, improvements in energy efficiency are achieved mainly through process changes encouraged by energy prices and as an investment strategy, whereas in the Colombian textile manufacturing activities, improvements in energy efficiency are achieved mainly by changes in the production processes, investments in R&D ,and application of new technologies. These results show the importance of technology, economies of scale, and energy efficiency-oriented policies and management strategies in improving energy efficiency within the textile industry.","Volume 14, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/2,48
"The present production and use of energy are causing depletion of resources and serious environmental problems. Accordingly, more and more countries are examining a whole range of new policies and technology issues to make their energy futures “sustainable,” thus increasing governmental incentives for technology providers and utility mandates to incorporate significant levels of renewable resources. Hand-in-hand with the sustainable development initiative, in recent years the concept of a “Smart Grid” for the delivery of energy to consumers has emerged. Existing distribution networks were not designed to accept extensive distributed generation (DG). The actual paradigm may change in the near future impelled by a worldwide increasing of DG penetration in distribution grids. This paper presents the status and content of Spanish legislation on DG. Fundamental considerations are first discussed, exclusively regarding the grid-interconnection requirement. This paper also analyses the relationship between that guidelines and recognized international standard in a systematic way. Major requirement areas include general specifications, safety and protection strategies, and power quality requirements. This study reveals the diversity of requirements for DG grid connection coexisting, considering both the national and the international context; this stresses the urgent need for international harmonization. It is interesting to note that in Spain (as in most of the European countries), protections for LV photovoltaic systems are defined but not for the rest of the distributed generation technologies in low voltage. Thus, one could conclude from this study that probably the most important barriers are the lack of adequate requirements and procedures.","Volume 14, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/2,48
"This paper reviews works involving small axial flow hydrokinetic turbines specifically for generating electrical power for off-grid remote communities and suggests improvements to overcome a major problem. Turbines mounted on pontoons or suspended using pivot arms from river banks or from jetties are reported able to produce about 1 kW to 2 kW of electrical power suitable for remote homes. However several deployments have experienced major problems with debris attaching to the turbines, resulting in interrupted operation. Excessive work in removing debris and furling result in frequent power cuts, a disadvantage in systems supplying AC power on demand, and this problem impedes the acceptance of hydrokinetic turbines in remote community electrification. Some methods of dealing with the debris problem have been suggested but these all involve interrupted operation. A system using a rotor with swept-back blades is suggested, where debris is shed automatically without lifting the turbine out of water. A deflecting device could also be used to push floating logs away from the swept area. By making the system resistant to debris, efficient axial flow turbines could be used practically in tropical rivers. Accessibility to power enables the use of basic home appliances and to encourage small village industries which can help to improve their socio-economic standard.","Volume 14, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/2,48
"Among all the renewable energy sources, small hydropower is considered to be one of the most promising. To take investment decision for the development of small hydropower projects, technical feasibility and financial viability are considered to be the foremost requirements. In the present study, an attempt has been made to develop correlations for cost of the run-of-river small hydropower projects under low head considering head and capacity as cost-influencing parameters. The cost of the projects has been determined by considering the quantity and the prevailing market price of each item for all the components of the projects. To verify the validity of the analytical results, the cost of projects determined based on developed correlations is compared with the cost of recently developed projects. It has been found that the developed correlation for cost may be used reasonably for cost estimates at the planning stage of development of such projects.","Volume 14, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/2,48
"In this study we differentiate the penetration of appliances in Mexican households according to income, and study its implications on commercial energy use and CO2 emissions in 1996 and 2006. We found that inequity in energy and CO2 emissions among income groups resulted to be higher in 2006 than in 1996. The share of household energy consumption for the first six income deciles decreased (from 45.5 to 38.9%), and differences in CO2 emissions among income groups resulted even higher. The study also shows an important reduction of commercial energy used for cooking due to decrease in unit energy consumption, and increase in the share of water heating and electric appliances in household commercial energy consumption due to increase in appliance ownership especially in higher income groups. From 1996 to 2006 CO2 emissions per household was reduced due to higher gas appliance efficiency and reduction of electricity emission factor.","Volume 14, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/2,48
"A survey of urban household energy usage patterns, types of fuel used for various applications and their reasons for choice of certain type of fuels and appliances was conducted in 2008–2009. From the survey it was observed that electricity is the dominant fuel used for lighting, space heating and cooling and water heating. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is the principal fuel used for cooking, followed by electricity, firewood and kerosene. Most households service their cooking stove only when it breaks down. And electric heating system is the main room heating system used followed by bukhari (traditional firewood fed metal stove used for room heating and normally not used for cooking) and kerosene heating system. None of the households used room cooling system other than ceiling fans. Commercial water boiler is the prevalent water heating system used by the households, followed by immersion heater, geyser (storage water heater) and bukhari. Most households spent an average of Nu 100–200 per month in summer and Nu 200–300 per month in winter for electricity (Nu: Ngultrum; Bhutanese currency; 1 US $ ≅ 45 Nu).","Volume 14, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/2,48

"The ice storage air-conditioning system with heat pipe was presented, and analytical model relating to the exergy loss amount and loss rate was developed in each component of the ice storage air-conditioning system. Exergy analysis results of the ice storage air-conditioning system with heat pipe were compared with those of the ice storage air-conditioning system with ice-on-coil. The energy saving and exergy loss reduction possibilities were also analyzed and discussed. The results indicated that the exergy efficiency of the ice storage air-conditioning system with heat pipe is 9.55% higher than that of the ice storage air-conditioning system with ice-on-coil. The exergy loss in the condenser can be reduced by reducing thermal resistance and the temperature difference of heat transfer or utilizing exergy of heat rejected by the condenser. The exergy loss in the expansion valve is reduced through increasing supercooling temperature of the refrigerant before entering into the expansion valve or decreasing pressure difference between the condensing pressure and the evaporating pressure.","Volume 14, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/2,48
"Farms consist of various elements which are constantly changing state, such as opening and closing gates, water trough levels, and feed levels. Monitoring the status of these elements automatically reduces the workload of a typical farmer, as well as providing benefits such as real-time monitoring, alerts and statistical analysis. A vital component of the farm monitoring architecture is a power supply unit for the monitoring devices. Being able to utilise the power from the electric fence energiser is of great interest as it would allow integration of this system into any electrically fenced farms. This paper presents a novel approach which uses the high voltage pulse of a radio frequency interference (RFI) suppressed electric fence energiser to power the monitoring devices. Since a small amount of the available energy may be drawn as not to affect the primary operation of the electric fence, the power supply presented in this paper should be as efficient as possible.","Volume 14, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/2,48
"Jatropha curcas L. has been considered as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production in several tropical countries. Two Jatropha plantation models currently being considered in Thailand, a perennial plantation for 20 years and annual harvesting, are compared vis-à-vis the energy benefits. The advantage of the perennial plantation is that fruit yield is low in the first 2 years but stabilizes after the second year; thus, the biodiesel production is maximized. On the other hand, the biodiesel yield for annual harvesting is low but substantial energy is gained from the wood which can be used for power production. The overall energy output from the annual system is about twice that of the perennial system whereas the biodiesel production is less than half. The energy values of both the systems are high and the net energy ratios as high as 6–7 indicating a substantial energy benefit.","Volume 14, Issue 1",March 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/1,49
"The fairness and effectiveness of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting economic development is a matter of substantial concern for the international community as it works towards another GHG reduction agreement in Copenhagen. Among other reasons, the CDM has been criticized as favoring some countries and disfavoring others, resulting in an imbalance in the distribution of development projects, thus undermining one of the original purposes of this institutional arrangement. In this paper, CDM projects were evaluated using econometric models based on international trade theory. Although the CDM suffers from imbalances as have been noted elsewhere, the primary determinant of CDM projects is the total GHG emissions from host and credit countries. GHG emissions in each were positively and consistently related to the CDM projects. Project size and the extent of a host country's infrastructure (such as road, rail lines, airports, electricity supply, telephone and internet connections) were each important determinants. Finally, results are discussed in the context of policy-based action that might limit or otherwise affect CDM implementation after the Copenhagen.","Volume 14, Issue 1",March 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/1,49
"There is little empirical evidence to underpin strategies of poverty reduction through income generation in small scale rural enterprises through supplying energy. This paper reports on research findings from a three country study in Bolivia, Tanzania and Vietnam which aimed to provide insights into the scope and depth of impacts of modern energy services. Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered using structure and semi-structured interviews. The nature of the data collected was shaped by the Livelihoods framework. An analytical framework of four questions was used to synthesise the findings. What energy transitions are taking place in small rural enterprises, who benefits? Does the presence of modern energy carriers/technology stimulate production? Does an increase in productivity lead to a decrease in poverty in terms of financial capital? What is the impact of the changes in energy carrier/technology on the other four types of capital in the livelihood framework?For all of the above, the dominant contextual factors influencing the process were noted.Electricity was the modern energy carrier surveyed in the three countries. In answer to the questions regarding scope of impacts, at least for electricity, the impacts appear to depend on the location of the enterprise with regard to diversity of demand for enterprise services. The section of the population with the largest direct benefits in terms of increased financial assets and job opportunities consists of the existing better-off members of the community and their extended family. However, the benefits of improved working conditions for many entrepreneurs and workers and of both time and access to new and better quality products and services to customers of enterprises reach a much larger group of people, and these impacts can provide a substantial impact on poverty, if not on the financial dimension of poverty.","Volume 14, Issue 1",March 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/1,49
"This case study, which analyzes wind power development policy in Taiwan, investigates a theme that is commonly encountered by policy makers in a number of policy settings—how can appropriate policies be developed when two (or more) seemingly valid, yet disparate scientific or technical estimates confound objective analysis? The paper adopts the context of wind power development policy in Taiwan to demonstrate how to employ organizational analysis to identify factors which influence subjective assumptions underpinning disparate estimates of wind power potential and then demonstrates the application of two concepts from chaos theory – fitness landscapes and strategic real options – for guiding policy making despite the existence of technological dissent.

"Of the total final energy consumption in India, the industrial sector accounts for about 36%, of which the manufacturing sector consumes about 66% (2004–2005 figures) with iron and steel, chemicals and petrochemicals, pulp and paper and cement industries being the largest energy users. In the recent past, energy intensity has been decreasing in the manufacturing sector, mainly due to fuel substitution away from coal in some sectors, most notably cement. Industrial output in developing countries like India continues to expand owing to rising populations and catching up on economic growth. This can result in higher energy use—energy provided primarily by the combustion of fossil fuels—and thereby to higher carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Using decomposition analysis, we show that most of the intensity reductions are driven purely by structural effect rather than actual improvement in energy efficiency.","Volume 14, Issue 1",March 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/1,49
"When renewable energy technologies are used in decentralized and remote areas, they can be coupled with diesel generators to improve the total system reliability. In this paper, wind–diesel generator–battery, wind–photovoltaic (PV)–diesel generator–battery, PV–diesel generator–battery hybrid and diesel generator systems for generating electricity in the rural areas of Bangladesh are analyzed. The main objective of the present study is to determine the optimum size of systems able to fulfill the requirements of 50 kWh/day primary load with 11 kW peak load for 50 households for three remote sites located at Cox's Bazar, Sylhet and Dinajpur. The methodology applied provides a useful and simple approach for sizing and analyzing the hybrid systems using HOMER, an optimization model for renewable energies. The aim is to identify a configuration among a set of systems that meets the desired system reliability requirements with the lowest electricity unit cost. The result of the analysis is a list of feasible power supply systems, sorted according to their net present cost. Furthermore, sensitivity diagrams, showing the influence of solar radiation, wind speed and diesel prices on the optimum solutions are also presented. The analysis results show that PV (6 kW)–diesel generator (10 kW)–battery hybrid system is most economically feasible and least cost of energy is about 25.4 Tk/kWh (1 USD = 68.5 Taka). The result also indicates that the decrease in CO2 emissions by using the feasible hybrid system with 40% renewable fraction is about 38% as compared to the diesel-only system.","Volume 14, Issue 1",March 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/1,49
"Current efforts to improve electricity services in Uganda evolve around satisfying growing urban demand as well as stabilizing and boosting a low electricity supply. Although virtually non-existent, rural electrification is receiving very little attention. This paper investigates the potential of wood-based biopower fueled from coppicing shrubs on its feasibility to provide affordable basic electricity services to rural Ugandan households. Gasification was the specific technology we assessed. In the calculations, a worst case scenario was chosen for wood-based biopower to compete with alternative sources of electricity: Cost and land use estimates assumed a rather high household consumption (30 kWh/month), a low household size (8 persons), a low area productivity (3 oven-dried tons per ha per year), a low electrical conversion efficiency (15%) and a high demand competing for fertile land with the biopower system. Cost estimates considered a high biomass price (18.5 US$/odt), a low capacity factor for the biopower system of 0.5 (therefore requiring installation of a larger unit) and high capital costs of 2300 US$ per kW installed. Additional pressure on fertile land would be negligible. Such biopower systems can outcompete other sources of electricity from a micro and macro-economic standpoint when looking at the local scale. Results indicate that biopower can deliver better and more energy services at 47 US$/yr and household or 0.11 US$/kWh which is below current average costs for e.g. off-grid lighting in rural Ugandan households. Additionally, only this biopower option offers the ability to households, sell wood to the biopower system and contribute at least four times as much to the local economy than the other electricity options used as terms of comparison. Further research has to focus on developing business plans and loan schemes for such biopower options including sustainable fuelwood supply chains based on coppicing shrubs which have the ability to contribute to agricultural site improvements. The approach outlined in this paper can further serve as a general framework to compare different options of electricity production across technologies and fuel sources especially for rural development purposes incorporating a multitude of aspects.","Volume 14, Issue 1",March 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/14/issue/1,49
"The state of Karnataka in India faces a shortfall in its electricity-generating capacity, which is higher during peak demand periods. To remedy this, the government has planned a large expansion of baseload capacity, mainly in the form of large coal based thermal power plants. In the study described here, we calculate the per-kilowatt hour costs of various supply side options at different plant load factors, and find that the current plans for supply expansion via large base-load generation plants is at odds with the objective of meeting demand shortfall at lowest cost. We estimate a comparable kilowatt hour cost of energy efficiency measures, and estimate their potential via a sector-wise analysis. A lowest cost planning exercise suggests that the increase in demand over the next decade can be met by implementing energy efficiency measures, expanding renewable sources of power to their capacity, and implementing the thermal power plants already contracted. Therefore it is not necessary to commission any new large coal based thermal plants during the next decade or more.","Volume 13, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/4,50
"The purpose of this paper is to conceptually analyze the cost-effectiveness of voluntary energy efficiency programs targeted at the industrial sector. In the paper a broad methodological framework for such an assessment is outlined, and this is applied empirically to discuss the potential cost-effectiveness of the ongoing Swedish energy efficiency program PFE. The focus lies on the presence of asymmetric information and bounded rationality, and the paper discusses how these factors may influence the cost-effectiveness of these types of programs. We also highlight the impact of the self-selection mechanism on the program's cost-effectiveness. The results show that the presence of information inefficiencies and asymmetries represents one of the major motives for policy intervention in the industrial energy efficiency field, but the substitution of energy management systems for electricity taxes—such as that achieved in the Swedish PFE program—does not necessarily address these asymmetries entirely cost-effectively. First, the presence of firm-government information asymmetries implies that electricity taxes could do a better job in energy-intensive companies while an energy management system could be more effective in companies with a low energy-intensive production process due to the lack of prior experience of energy efficiency measures. The current set-up of PFE induces the reverse situation. Second, although firm-internal information asymmetries may well exist in the participating energy-intensive companies—implying that energy management systems could do a good job in detecting cost-effective measures—this is likely to be even more true for the non-participating companies (again due to their comparatively low accumulated knowledge in the energy efficiency field). It should however also be acknowledged that this analysis is static, and in the long-run voluntary energy efficiency programs may lead to significant learning impacts and—given the public good characteristics of this new knowledge—to important spillover effects.","Volume 13, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/4,50

A simple still, which has a 20° cover tilt angle and equipped with internal and external reflectors is investigated at latitude angle of 33.3°N. It was found that the average daily yield is increased by the use of internal and/or external reflectors except for summer where the effect of the reflectors is found to be negative. The increase in the productivity of the still with reflector(s) compared to the still with no reflectors (increase ratio) is averaged at 19.9% and 34.5%, 34.4%, 34.8% and 24.7% for still with internal reflector only, still with internal and an inclined external reflector tilted at 0°, 10°, 20°, and 30° respectively. Accordingly, a comparable yearly productivity is expected for external reflector angle ranging from vertical to 20°.

"An effective quality control is essential for a large-scale dissemination of solar thermal technologies on the products being offered by the industry to the end users. For this, there is a need to establish test procedures and methodologies for producing performance characteristic parameters, which could provide an equitable basis for comparison of performances of these products. At present, paraboloid concentrator type solar cooker technology is moving towards the phase of commercialization in India. For the thermal performance evaluation of paraboloid concentrator type solar cooker, Mullick et al. (1991) developed a test procedure that essentially recommends determination of optical efficiency factor (F′ηo) and heat loss factor (F′UL) based on heating and cooling tests. Further a test method has been proposed by Funk (2000) for testing of all kind of solar cookers that characterizes the performance of solar cooker by two parameters, namely, adjusted cooking power (Pa) and overall heat loss coefficient (UL) as obtained from heating test. These are the only test methods available for testing of paraboloid concentrator type solar cooker.The present communication analyzes the effect of instrumentation, on the values of F′ηo, F′UL, Pa and UL, which is supported by a large number of outdoor tests conducted on a paraboloid concentrator type solar cooker under heating and cooling test conditions. The role of individual associated parameters on F′ηo, F′UL, Pa and UL has been analyzed along with the estimation of overall error in these values due to the error in the determination of associated parameters. Though the maximum attainable accuracy in determining F′UL varies from 1.15% to 0.65% (for loads of 1.0 to 8.0 kg), the associated error in the determination of F′ηo is quite high viz. 5.13% to 5.04% for the same load conditions. Similarly, the maximum attainable accuracy in the determination of standardized cooking power has been observed from 4.98% to 5.02% under the load conditions from 1.0 to 8.0 kg.","Volume 13, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/4,50
"Bioenergy is the subject of increasing attention around the world and represents a controversial issue. The rise of commodity prices, the negative impact on food security and climate change represent different challenges to be overcome before the full potentials of bioenergy can be realized. In the context of the development of bioenergy, issues relating to agriculture need special attention. Bioenergy development is always linked with food security. Farmers, having the choice to convert their food crops to fuel crops, naturally expect a high return from their farmland, thereby generating a scenario where food production falls. Present work by doing a case study of a typical district from India namely Tumkur shows that optimal production of bioenergy can be achieved by using the wasteland present in the area. This way, food security for future generations can be maintained along with optimal growth of bioenergy.","Volume 13, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/4,50
"Four out of five people without electricity live in rural areas of developing countries, mainly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Most of these households use kerosene lamps for lighting. The light outputs of these devices are very poor and vary from about 10 to 100 lumens, depending on the type of lamps and wicks. The paper compares the technology, economics and CO2 emissions of kerosene-based lamps with modern bio-energy systems and solar photovoltaics. Light output, luminous efficacy and energy consumption are used for comparing the technical parameters. Economics is expressed in terms of the cost of useful energy (cost per 1000 lumen hours), determined from the annualized life cycle cost of the systems. Fuel consumption rates are used to determine CO2 emissions of all the devices. This study reveals that efficient electric lighting provides higher light levels and low energy consumption as well as low CO2 emissions. In the absence of grid electricity, distributed renewable energy systems such as solar photovoltaics (at individual house level) and modern bio-energy systems are better options for providing good quality and reliable lighting in rural areas compared to traditional kerosene-based lighting. Moreover, these renewable energy systems as well as grid-based electricity systems also reduce CO2 emissions.","Volume 13, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/4,50
"Technology assessment is a critical process in managing technology. It is critical to select the right technologies that would meet the needs of the organization acquiring the technology. This becomes even more challenging in an era of globalization and exponentially increasing emerging technologies. This paper presents a framework to address this challenge and applies it in the case of a building manufacturer in Thailand. The specific problem in this case is the acquisition of green technologies. The technologies evaluated in this paper are thin-film PV, printable ink thin-film PV, and a paint coating to provide additional thermal insulation. Three different perspectives were used to evaluate the technologies: technological, organizational and marketing. Expert judgments were used to evaluate the technologies across these perspectives using multiple criteria. Technology forecasting with patent analysis was used to enhance the decision. As a result, paint insulation was identified as the right technology in this case.","Volume 13, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/4,50
"Rural communities of developing nations need refrigeration to preserve perishable foods like fish or milk, for cold drinks, and for other needs. Because of the increasing cost and scarcity of traditional energy sources and because a large percentage of the rural population does not have electrical service, they cannot depend upon electricity for refrigeration. It is becoming more desirable to utilize alternative energy sources. This article describes the “ISAAC™,” a solar powered icemaker and its application to milk preservation in two rural villages in the coast of Kenya. Three solar icemakers were installed in each of two rural communities and two dairy co-operatives were established. Over 100 farmers have increased their income by increased ability to market their milk. The project was funded by the World Bank's Development Marketplace program. The project partners are Solar Ice Company and Heifer Project International. The project generates rural income, rural jobs, alleviates poverty, and contributes to food and energy security. The project has enormous replication potential.","Volume 13, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/4,50
"It is not cost effective or feasible to extend a centralized power grid to islands and other isolated communities. Decentralized renewable energy sources are alternatives. Among these alternatives are hybrid photovoltaic systems which combine solar photovoltaic energy with other renewable energy sources like wind. A diesel backup system can be used when PV system fails to satisfy the load and when the battery storage is depleted. If the hybrid systems are optimized, these would be cost effective and more reliable.This paper presents an optimal design of a solar PV-diesel hybrid mini-grid system for a fishing community in an isolated island—Sandwip in Bangladesh. The electrical load is considered based on the local needs and the electrical load demand is 15 kWh. This load is based on 2 lights (compact florescent bulb, 230 V, 15 W), 1 fan (ceiling fan, 230 V, 40 W) and 1 television (TV, 230 V, 80 W) for each family of the rural settings of the island. The system is optimized using genetic algorithms. If the renewable energy source produces more than the one required by the loads, the excess energy can be used to charge the battery while if the amount of energy demand is higher than the one produced by the renewable energy source, the control strategy determines the most economical way to meet the energy deficit. The optimized system configurations are: 4s × 12p 50 W PV panels, 4s × 3p 200 Ah batteries, 230 V 1.9 kVA ac generator and 3300 VA inverter. The system supplies 48 V dc and 230 V ac. The major share of the energy (23,077 kWh) comes from solar while the contribution of diesel generation is very small (35 kWh).This study reveals that the major shares of the cost are for solar panels and batteries. Technological development in solar photovoltaic technology and economic production of batteries would make rural electrification in the isolated islands more promising and demanding. Finally, the sustainability of solar-diesel hybrid mini-grid for an isolated island—Sandwip is discussed.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/3,51
"Detailed techno-economic analysis and thousands of hourly simulations were executed to design an optimal autonomous hybrid photovoltaic-diesel-battery system to meet the load of an off-grid house, located in a remote Jordanian settlement. The hybrid system with 23% of photovoltaic energy penetration and comprised of 2 kW PV array, diesel generator with a rated power of 4 kW and 2 storage batteries in addition to 2 kW converter was found to be the optimal system and it becomes economically feasible for diesel prices greater than 0.15 $/L. This is in favor of utilizing the hybrid system to supplement the off-grid remote house with electricity, since the current diesel price in Jordan is about 0.238 $/L. Utilizing this system for electricity generation decreased the operating hours of the diesel generators by 19.3% and diesel consumption by 18.5% in comparison with the diesel-only situation. This in turn led to about 18% reduction in emissions of green house gases. Moreover, this investigation has examined the effect of battery storage and photovoltaic penetration on the performance and the cost of generated electricity by the feasible hybrid system. It is believed that the outcome of this investigation will benefit researchers from other developing countries, with similar climatic and economic conditions as Jordan in designing hybrid photovoltaic-diesel-battery systems and further attain sustainable development in rural areas.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/3,51
"This work aims at studying the possible application of solar energy to deep well water pumps for water supply in rural or isolated zones. Developing countries are composed of numerous small villages and farmers, making it economically unviable to extend the electrical national grid to every location where it is needed. Also the difficulty in collecting dues makes this solution even less viable. These countries still struggle with the lack of water in many villages and farms. These factors, along with the increase in the price of conventional energy sources and concerns regarding sustainable growth, have led to the development of solar powered water pumps. Most African, South Asian and Latin-American countries have good sun exposure almost all year and many of its villages still have lack of water. For this study we considered a small village composed of 10 families with a daily consumption of 100 l each, a well with a depth of 100 m, a reservoir 10 m above ground level, an autonomy of 6 days and a permitted loss of load of 2%. In this work a PV advanced model was used. For the conditions mentioned, a water cost of 1.07 €/m3 and an investment cost of 3019 € were obtained. A pump power of 154 W and a solar array of 195 Watt peak (Wp) are necessary. The water cost obtained is believed to be a competitive value proving these types of solutions as good alternatives to extending the electric grid or having a diesel generator connected to the pump.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/3,51
"The main objective of this work is to determine and design a suitable wind turbine which could be employed for rural homes or other small-scale applications. A variety of horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines exist, each possessing a number of advantages and disadvantages which needed to be taken into account before a basis for the design is selected. A small robust design which is relatively simple and cheap to construct is in essence the main criteria for wind turbine selection. A Savonius type rotor, which is a rotor based on a modification of the ‘S’ rotor, is selected as it best fitted the design criteria. A small prototype 1.5 m tall with a rotor diameter of 0.65 m is designed and built. The finished prototype is used to estimate the power obtainable under normal operating conditions.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/3,51
"The gasification characteristics of coir pith are studied in a circulating fluidized bed gasifier using air as the gasifying medium. The effect of various parameters such as temperature, Equivalence Ratio (ER), and Oxygen/Carbon ratio (O/C) on gas yield, gas composition, gas heating value, carbon conversion, cold gas and overall thermal efficiency is studied. The ERs employed in the study are 0.18, 0.21, 0.24 and 0.31. It has been found that temperature has an influence on the cracking reactions, as indicated by the increased yield of hydrogen. The maximum yield of hydrogen is obtained at a temperature of 1028.6 °C, and as the Equivalence Ratio (ER) increased, hydrogen yield decreased. The gas yield also increased with increase in temperature and ER. Also it has been observed that the gas heating value increases with increase in temperature and decrease in ER. Carbon conversion is found to increase with increase in temperature and increase in ER. It is found that the increase in temperature favours both the cold gas thermal and overall thermal efficiencies. Also the cold gas and overall thermal gasification efficiencies decrease with increase in Equivalence Ratio.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/3,51
"Details of existing conversion technologies for cellulosic ethanol production, both hydrolysis and thermochemical, have been discussed along with their present adoption status. Furthermore, economics of ethanol production by using different conversion technologies has been discussed. Emerging conversion technologies and other developments which might affect the cellulosic ethanol production are also characterized. Based on current estimates, it was found that about 400 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol will be produced in the country in coming years using different conversion technologies. It was noticed that out of several available conversion technologies, thermochemical-based technologies are gaining popularity and it is projected that the use of these conversion technologies will reduce the cellulosic ethanol production cost significantly. Similarly, recent advancements in hydrolysis-based technologies have also helped in reducing the production cost of cellulosic ethanol. However, more resources will be needed in coming years to meet the policy goal of producing 21 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol by the year 2022. It is expected that this review will be helpful in efficient allocation of resources for facilitating future technology development and in streamlining the whole initiative of cellulosic ethanol production in the United States.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/3,51
"A geothermal resource represents a clean and renewable source of energy for many parts of the world. It is a relatively mature and proven technology which has been used to generate electricity since 1904. Despite the availability of some potentially resources-rich geothermal locations, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has not undertaken any serious geothermal projects. It is the aim of this paper to identify the real barriers hindering the utilisation of geothermal resources in Saudi Arabia. Current obstacles, obtained from several qualitative interviews, include uncertainty with regard to existing geothermal resources as well as the availability of more cost-effective sources of energy.

"This paper describes the energy efficiency development in the German and Colombian industrial sectors between 1998 and 2005. Using data at the two- and three-digit levels for the German and Colombian manufacturing industry, the performance of the industrial sector is analysed in terms of energy intensity, value of production, value added, fuel sources and energy costs. It was found that energy consumption in the industrial sector has increased by 2.3% in Germany and 5.5% in Colombia, whereas energy intensity decreased by 12% and 6% respectively during the sample period. A decomposition analysis was performed in order to separate structural, production and intensity effects. It was found that in both countries, the aggregate energy intensity in the industrial sector was highly dependent on the changes in the energy intensive sectors (EISs). The trend is to produce more while consuming less energy. In Germany, structural and intensity effects contributed to energy efficiency improvement, whereas in Colombia, intensity effects dominated over structural effects. Moreover, in both countries the capital intensity and energy prices influenced the changes in the aggregate energy intensity, whereas the changes in labour intensity did not show a clear relationship with the energy intensity results. These results showed the importance of the formulation and adoption of energy policies in the industrial sector, taking into account that several differences in energy efficiency performance exist at the different levels of aggregation and that energy policy instruments ought to encourage cost-effective energy efficiency.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/3,51
"This paper shows the relationship between the energy contribution of an 11.07 kWp grid-connected photovoltaic system and the particularities of its operation in parallel with a conventional electric distribution grid. Taking the experimental results as a starting point, it was verified that the contribution to the building's annual consumption is about 55% of the total load. The experimental results show how this kind of device influences the power quality parameters of the building: total harmonic distortion (THD), power factor (FP), and RMS voltage. The building power factor can be altered in a significant way depending on the system's production capacity and on the building load profile. Therefore, if a great number of PV systems are connected to the distribution grid, the reverse power flow coming from those systems can cause an increase in the voltage of a feeder and eventually cross the allowed upper threshold.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/3,51
"This article explores the linkages between government energy policies and energy use for rural development. The article is based on surveys conducted in selected rural communities in Northern Ghana that are beneficiaries of several energy dissemination programs spearheaded by the government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and donors. Primary data were collected on energy use at the household and community levels using questionnaires and focus group discussions complemented by interviews of energy policy makers. Ghana's energy policy documents were reviewed to gain further insights into the policy process. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to treat and analyze the data obtained through household questionnaires, while the data generated from interviews and focus group discussions were subjected to content analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that while energy use contributes to improving conditions for education due to lighting services at the household and community levels, the patterns of energy use inhibit rural job creation, gender roles, and health care in the surveyed communities. The article concludes that the low contribution of energy toward rural development is to a large extent driven by an energy policy that inhibits the delivery and use of modern energy sources in rural Ghana. Consequently, achieving an energy future that has greater relevance to rural development in Ghana requires a mix of policy tools that enhances the delivery and use of modern energy systems in rural communities in the country.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/3,51
"As large petroleum reserves were confirmed in the Yasuni National Park of Ecuador, one of the most biodiverse hotspots in the Amazonian region and the world, Ecuador has proposed indefinitely keeping almost a billion barrels of petroleum underground, if the international community contributes with at least half of the opportunity cost of exploiting the petroleum. An internationally administrated fund with UN participation will be created and invested exclusively in conservation, renewable energy and social development. The proposal has already received significant support from international institutions, European governments, NGOs and personalities worldwide.Ecuador, a less developed country in South America, remains dependent of petroleum exports, which have not led to economic growth and diversification, did not reduce poverty and inequality, and had strong environmental impacts. Given the limits of petroleum reserves, the Yasuni-ITT initiative opens alternatives towards sustainable development in the country, allowing a transition towards a post-petroleum society, and promoting ways towards human development within the limits of biodiversity conservation.This proposal, which can be replicated by other developing countries with fossil fuel reserves in biodiverse areas, opens new alternatives for post-Kyoto negotiations with binding commitments for several developing countries, and simultaneously addresses global warming, biodiversity loss, and poverty. In addition, it addresses national and international environmental justice.The article summarizes the proposal within the post-Kyoto context, and discusses relevant topics, such as its significance for Ecuador's development performance and future, as well as national and international environmental justice.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/3,51
"This study was undertaken to assess the potential of two types of improved cookstoves to reduce indoor air pollution in African homes. An ethanol stove, the CleanCook, was tested in three locations in Ethiopia: the city of Addis Ababa and the Bonga and Kebribeyah Refugee Camps, while a wood-burning rocket stove, the Gyapa, was evaluated in Accra, Ghana. In both countries, kitchen concentrations of PM2.5 and CO, the two pollutants responsible for the bulk of the ill-health associated with indoor smoke, were monitored in a before and after study design without controls. Baseline (‘before’) measurements were made in households using a traditional stove or open fire. ‘After’ measurements were performed in the same households, once the improved stove had been introduced. PM2.5 was measured using UCB Particle Monitors, which have photoelectric detectors. CO was measured with Onset HOBO Loggers. In Ghana and Kebribeyah Camp, CO was also measured with Gastec diffusion tubes. In Ghana, average 24-hour PM2.5 concentrations decreased 52% from 650 μg/m3 in the 'before' phase to 320 μg/m3 in the 'after' phase (p = 0.00), and average 24-hour kitchen CO concentrations decreased 40% from 12.3 ppm to 7.4 ppm (p = 0.01). Including all three subgroups in Ethiopia, average PM2.5 concentrations decreased 84% from 1 250 μg/m3 to 200 μg/m3 (p = 0.00) and average CO concentrations decreased 76% from 38.9 ppm to 9.2 ppm (p = 0.00). 24-hour average CO levels in households using both the Gyapa and CleanCook stoves met, or nearly met, the World Health Organization (WHO) 8-hour Air Quality Guideline. PM2.5 concentrations were well above both the WHO 24-hour Guideline and Interim Targets. Therefore, despite the significant improvements associated with both of these stoves, further changes in stove or fuel type or household fuel mixing patterns would be required to bring PM to levels that are not considered harmful to health.","Volume 13, Issue 2",June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/2,52
"Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), sustainable development is considered a country context-specific aspect which differs across countries. Actual CDM practice has shown that projects are largely initiated by the demand for relatively low-cost certified emission reductions, leading to a series of ad-hoc projects, rather than serving the overall host countries' sustainable development needs and priorities. In the above framework, the study aims to direct CDM towards national sustainable development priorities, through the identification of sustainable energy technology priorities for electricity generation in five examined developing countries, namely Chile, China, Israel, Kenya and Thailand. The current approach lays emphasis on the formulation of the process so as to be relatively straightforward to incorporate direct experts' preferences as well as trying to deal with the needs of flexibility and validity, through the use of an existing Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, namely the Electre TRI method.","Volume 13, Issue 2",June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/2,52
"South Africa is in the grips of an electricity crisis. Currently, the bulk of power is produced at coal fired power stations which are located far from the large load centres. Solar energy is widely available in South Africa, and could be used to complement this coal based generation, and supply energy at the point of use. This paper aims to investigate the impact of residential solar water heating on power system transmission losses. Initially simulations were carried out in order to determine the impact of solar water heating on a household's electricity demand. These were done for households located in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. A number of solar water heating installations in Cape Town were also monitored, in order to validate the simulation results. Lastly, a power system model was developed in order to investigate the possible impact of large-scale implementation of solar water heating, at varied penetration levels, on a transmission system. Using the model and the results obtained from the simulations, a utility impact analysis was carried out in order to determine the effect on transmission losses. It was concluded that large-scale implementation of solar water heating can be used as a means to alleviate loading and losses on power systems' transmission lines particularly during peak demand.","Volume 13, Issue 2",June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/2,52
"Heat pumps have been used to reduce energy consumption in distillation columns. However, the effects of some parameters have not been taken into consideration in the determination of energy consumption in such systems. Perhaps this is one of the reasons for little or no application of the system in ethanol which is fast becoming a competitive fuel to petrol. The study reported here considers the effect of pressure increase across the compressor, column heat loss and the overall heat transfer coefficient of reboiler–condenser as an explicit function of Prandtl, Reynolds and Nusselt numbers. This was to study the overall influence of these parameters on energy consumption and energy effectiveness (coefficient of performance). An ethanol–water conventional distillation column with direct vapour recompression was used as a case study. Results showed that when these parameters were included in the model equation, there was an increase in compressor power input and total energy consumption while the energy effectiveness reduced. Also, the comparison of the two systems showed that while the values of the column heat loss, reboiler heat transfer rate, total energy consumption and overall heat transfer coefficient were greater for the actual (VRCΔP) system, the coefficient of performance and the heat pump distribution factor were more for the control (VRC) system. The significance of this work is the provision of information for the determination of energy effectiveness as well as appropriate capacity of the auxiliary equipment.","Volume 13, Issue 2",June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/2,52
"Since the introduction of biogas technology into Kenya in the mid 1950s, only a small percentage of farmers have adopted the technology. In addition, the functional status and sustainability of the constructed biogas plants remain unknown. The objective of this study, therefore, was to investigate and assess the factors that affect the adoption and sustainability of the technology by dairy cattle farmers. The study employed the ex-post-facto social survey research design. The target population was the 9466 farmers in Nakuru and Nakuru North districts. Selection of the two hundred farmers was through stratified proportionate random sampling procedure in order to represent the various plant designs and farmer populations in the respective administrative divisions. Data collection was through a pre-tested interview schedule, two types of questionnaires and a personal observation schedule while analysis was through descriptive and inferential statistics (Chi-square) by use of SPSS software. The results of the analysis revealed that while a farmer's socio-economic status significantly influenced the decision to adopt the technology, it did not influence the sustainability of the constructed plants. The research concluded that while the potential of the technology to flourish in the study area is high, its promotion is necessary. However due to the multifaceted nature of the problem, remedial action calls for a multi-disciplinary approach by all stakeholders that include governmental and non-governmental organizations, technology experts, farmers as well as research and training institutions. The promotion exercise should take into consideration the adoption constraints that include awareness creation, land tenure security, financial capital, livestock improvement and research and policy review.","Volume 13, Issue 2",June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/2,52
"This study investigates whether a key conclusion of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, that is, an annual investment of 1% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to mitigate the negative economic impacts of climate change, would allow for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Republic of Ecuador (Ecuador). An integrated modeling approach to support climate policy evaluation, consisting in the Threshold 21 (T21) model and other methodologies, is employed to carry out a country-wide, cross-sectoral analysis of Ecuador's energy, social, economic and environmental sectors. The investigation assumes an investment of 1% of GDP in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies to measure the potential to stabilize carbon emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation. Results of the study indicate that while investing 1% of GDP annually through 2025 would reduce GHG emissions in the electric power sector, it would not stabilize national emissions. On the other hand, avoided electricity costs realized from the investment in energy efficiency, amounting to over USD 5 billion by 2025, could contribute significantly to poverty alleviation, job creation, and to the improvement of social services. Finally, the authors find that these positive economic and social results are likely to increase energy consumption, making the goal to reduce GHG emissions more challenging.","Volume 13, Issue 2",June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/2,52

Furthermore, a development strategy for geothermal energy in the country is proposed. The results show that Jordan has enormous underground energy resources in many parts of the country in the form of thermal underground hot water (wells and thermal springs), having a temperature ranging from 20 °C to 62 °C. It was also found that the installed capacity of geothermal energy is 153.3 MWt and the annual energy supply potential is 1540 TJ/year in the form of domestic hot water for bathing and swimming, giving an overall capacity factor of 0.42.

"This work attempts to assess existing approaches to study the implementation of renewable energy technologies (RET) in specific islands in order to test if classification of islands is possible on the basis of renewable energy approach used, if there is a certain degree of correlation between renewable energy and sustainable tourism development, and if a path towards thematic tourism development might be opened through strategies and infrastructures based on renewable energy. Approaches of this kind have been attempted before, but frameworks used were either solely technical or not holistic in that they have not fully assessed the institutionalisation and governance aspects of RET penetration into island territories. Nevertheless, the authors consider that the strategic process of RET implementation can be effectively described in terms of institutional and strategic architecture. Therefore, in this paper we present a framework which assesses aspects of the institutional and governance aspects. In this framework, we first identify the strategic drivers for RET implementation and, then, we group islands according to these drivers. As a further step, we interpret and identify the dominant elements of the various RET integration strategies for these groups. The analysis shows that strategies related to RET implementation can be classified into four groups differing in motivation and present status of RET implementation. The next step links groups to the dominant type of tourism identified in each island. At this stage, the analysis has shown that our groupings are compatible with qualitative tourism features, in the sense that RET groups were associated with specific qualitative features of the tourism business. We were thus in a position to identify specific causalities between RET and tourism activity and to produce a conceptual diagram which shows graphically the linkage between RET and tourism when a specific political approach is undertaken. We thus came into a position to ascertain, for example, that “institutional” and “process” drivers function mainly at a local scale, whereas “competence” and “technology” drivers are mainly motivated by a wider scale (European or international). This suggests that RET implementation can follow different routes depending on existing tourism needs and choice of tourism policy. This is very useful for decision makers to know if they wish to position RET correctly as a driver for the creation of a new sustainable tourism market or (alternatively), as a support service for existing tourism development.","Volume 13, Issue 2",June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/2,52
"Presently used centralised energy planning model ignores energy needs of rural areas and poor and has also led to environmental degradation, whereas decentralised energy planning model is in the interest of efficient utilisation of resources. Energy planning at the village level is the bottom limit of the application of decentralised planning principle. The individual villages are the smallest social units where the energy consumption occurs. Renewable energy is energy derived from sources that are being replaced by nature, such as water, wind, solar or biomass. Renewable sources are essentially non-polluting if applied correctly. The paper presents a review of the important decentralised renewable energy options, related case studies of successful deployment of renewable energy technologies in India and resulting lessons learnt. Case studies discussed in the present work show the feasibility of decentralised energy options for the residential and small scale applications in a village or a cluster of villages. The paper also details the different initiatives taken by the government of India to promote decentralised energy production in India. It is found that the small scale power generation systems based on the renewable energy sources are more efficient and cost effective. Thus the focus should be on the small scale renewable energy technologies that can be implemented locally by communities and small scale producers, but can make a significant overall contribution towards the national energy supply.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/1,53
"Nigeria experienced a long history of macroeconomic instability since political independence. For many years, Nigerian policymakers had been unsuccessful in their attempts to manage the national economy to deal with macroeconomic instability. They have been accused of mismanagement and incompetence when it comes to preparation and execution of national budgets. In an effort to arrest this problem, the federal government recently introduced structure into public budgeting. A Fiscal Responsibility Act was passed to improve the budgetary process. Consistent with the law, policymakers are required to devise a process for forecasting revenue. Thus, with the help of experts from the International Monetary Fund, an ARMA(p,q) (autoregressive moving average) process was recommended. An ARMA model combines an autoregressive component which captures past values of a time series with a moving average component which captures past forecast errors associated with the time series. As a mono-cultural economy with crude oil as the main source of government revenue, an ARMA(p,q) process assumes that the oil price series is stationary with a short memory. In this paper, we set out to test for the presence of long memory or persistence in oil price series using weekly data from 1978 to 2007. The results of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) suggest Nigeria's oil price series is anti-persistent. A Hurst exponent of 0.48 is indicative of a time series which is covariance stationary but mean-reverting. In other words, we can fit a stationary ARMA(p,q) model driven by fractional noise to the series. This implies that a low price level has a tendency to be followed by a high price level and vice versa. Thus, past price trends are more likely to change in the future. Moreover, the effect of shocks to the price system dies away in the long run. Therefore, the current revenue forecasting tool would need to be overhauled in the presence of price reversals. This is more critical in the face of constant disruptions to oil production in the Niger Delta where the Forcados variety is produced.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/1,53
"In developing countries, photovoltaic systems often remain unaffordable for inhabitants of rural areas. Therefore, special financing mechanisms need to be implemented to support their dissemination. For instance, fee-for-service schemes enable users to spread the up-front costs of photovoltaic systems over a long period, and provide a solution to the problem of their long-term maintenance.The paper surveys Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) that have been established in the Eastern Province of Zambia. Three small enterprises have been selected in 1999 and each manage 100–150 solar home systems. Regular contacts with technicians facilitate their follow-up and provide feedback from customers. Systems are now running efficiently and customers seem satisfied with the quality of the service provided. However, solar systems tend to be overused and batteries to be constantly discharged as the electricity loads increases.Furthermore, these small enterprises still face financial uncertainties due to a high inflation rate in Zambia and the difficulty to increase regularly monthly fees. Even with an initial subsidy from the funding agency, only the wealthiest customers of the area, with regular incomes, can be targeted. And like all rural electrification programs, a long-term involvement of the state is still needed to cover part of the capital costs and expand the scheme to new customers.However, even with its current limitations, this case shows that a well-articulated public–private partnership can deliver a cost-effective energy service in rural areas. With a more flexible offer of photovoltaic systems and the addition of other energy services, small energy companies seem to be able to usefully complement the role of conventional utilities.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/1,53
"Numerous renewable energy electrification programs that have been implemented in developing countries over the past decade have met with relatively limited success. Much of the effort that has been invested in attempting to understand the causes of lack of success has focused on the identification of barriers. This narrow focus on only barriers, however, fails to consider other important factors that may contribute to the success or lack of success of programs. An email survey was used to obtain the views of those with responsibility for the implementation of solar PV home system programs in Asia and the Pacific region on their programs. The purpose of the survey was to better understand the factors that implementing agencies consider to be important in the designing and implementation of SHS programs. The survey results indicated that program objectives tend to be couched in very broad and administrative terms rather than in terms of the outcomes for system users, weakening the ability to make meaningful assessments of program success. Although best practice program guidelines were infrequently used, even where program implementers were aware of their existence, even more fundamental problems were found to beset some programs. Adequate funding support and the use of appropriate financing mechanisms were considered to be the most critical factors for program success and a variety of financing mechanisms were used, including micro-credit and a novel mechanism which indicated a maturation of program design. System maintenance and monitoring were considered important by most program implementers, although training was reported to be provided to both technicians and system users in a minority of cases and some program implementers expressed concerns over the timeliness of program monitoring and maintenance where this had been outsourced. Unit system cost varied from US$7.20/Wp to US$14.58/Wp between programs and was determined by factors such as remoteness, number of system program users and reliance on imported equipment. The program outcomes commonly regarded to be achieved were increased gender equity, increased social activities, increased access to information and increased working hours. The majority of program implementers, however, did not regard their programs as having resulted in increased employment or household income. Factors seen as instrumental in limiting program success were lack of adequate government policy and funding support, lack of involvement of local communities in program design, and a lack of in-house technical know-how, and a lack of availability of components in locations proximate to users. The main conclusions from results of the survey are that the reasons behind program success or lack of success are complex, but that program success could be improved in many instances by following best practice guidelines, specifying program objectives in terms of outcomes for users, ensuring that adequate funding and policy support is available and that program implementers have adequate training in program management. The results were used to develop a comprehensive set of criteria that could be applied in the development of future programs.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/1,53
"There is widespread and growing international concern about global climate change resulting from greenhouse effect. CO2 removal from natural gas gives one of the solutions to reduce emissions from the gas-based power plants. Partial oxidation of natural gas with the presence of steam and restricted air produces carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This carbon monoxide can be converted into carbon dioxide and hydrogen, in the presence of steam in a shift reactor. Carbon dioxide is absorbed before gas turbine combustion from the products of the shift reactor. The resulting fuel for combustion mainly consists of hydrogen and nitrogen, thus combustion (e.g. in a gas turbine) exhaust is virtually devoid of CO2.The paper discusses the selection of some important parameters necessary to obtain a maximum level of conversion of hydrogen from natural gas in the partial oxidation reactor. The parameters which influence the hydrogen production are air-to-methane ratio, steam-to-methane ratio and reactor pressure. The results showed that a net efficiency of 43%, with a 95.5% of fuel conversion can be obtained by combined cycle with dual pressure heat recovery steam generator based on present technological status.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/1,53
"It is commonly recognized among rural energy experts and development practitioners that electrification activities in rural areas of developing countries should be accompanied by complementary services. Nevertheless, rural electrification projects that confine themselves to hardware financing and civil works without undertaking escorting activities are observed frequently. This paper highlights the necessity of complementary services such as sensitisation campaigns or business development services by reporting experiences gained during the preparation of a grid based electrification project in rural Benin. One intriguing result is that the target group – be it households, enterprises, or social institutions – is frequently not aware of the economic potentials of electricity and hence cannot be expected to consider the grid connection decision and the usage of electricity rationally in an economic sense. It is concluded that responsibility for complementary services should be in principle with the grid operator, while the government or regulatory bodies have to assure welfare orientation of the services.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/1,53
"A method is investigated for increasing the utilization efficiency of energy resources and reducing environmental emissions, focusing on utility-scale cogeneration and the contributions of nuclear energy. A case study is presented for Ontario using the nuclear and fossil facilities of the main provincial electrical utility. Implementation of utility-based cogeneration in Ontario or a region with a similar energy system and attributes is seen to be able to reduce significantly annual and cumulative uranium and fossil fuel use and related emissions, provide economic benefits for the province and its electrical utility, and substitute nuclear energy for fossil fuels. The reduced emissions of greenhouse gases are significant, and indicate that utility-based cogeneration can contribute notably to efforts to combat climate change. Ontario and other regions with similar energy systems and characteristics would benefit from working with the regional electrical utilities and other relevant parties to implementing cogeneration in a careful and optimal manner. Implementation decisions need to balance the interests of the stakeholders when determining which cogeneration options to adopt and barriers to regional utility-based cogeneration need to be overcome.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/1,53
"In the present investigation an attempt was made to test the feasibility of crude rice bran oil methyl ester (CRBME) which is derived from high free fatty acid (FFA) crude rice bran oil (CRBO) by a two-step transesterification process as a fuel for a heavy-duty automotive compression ignition (CI), i.e. diesel engine in blended form. While running with CRBME blend significant reductions in CO, UBHC and particulate emission were observed with a marginal increase in NOx emission than that of diesel. Brake thermal efficiency of the engine reduced marginally for CRBME blend when compared with diesel. In addition to technical feasibility, the economic feasibility of CRBME blend as a CI engine fuel was also analyzed by comparing its hourly fuel cost with CRBO blend and diesel. It was found that the hourly fuel cost of CRBME blend is higher than CRBO blend and diesel. Calculations have shown that the hourly fuel cost of CRBME blend when used in a stationary engine increases by 50% while that in an automotive engine increases by 45% when compared to diesel. Experimental results show that as a fuel for a heavy-duty diesel engine CRBME blend shows better emission characteristics than diesel with a marginal increase in NOx emission. Hence efforts can be taken to utilize it effectively.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/1,53
"India has the second largest population in the world and is ranked number six in terms of CO2 emissions generated from fossil fuels. A large portion of its power plants is old and inefficient, and it is expected that India in the coming 10–15 years will need to upgrade and extend its power sector significantly. This may give rise to new initiatives that bring the harnessing of indigenous coal in a green manner into question.This article takes into consideration opportunities of emerging polygeneration schemes intended (mainly) for the electric power sector with inclusion of additional yields like synthetic fuels, chemicals and heat. Reference is made to European-based initiatives pertaining to the capture and storage of carbon dioxide (CCS) — especially a Sino-European project COACH1 that is operated under the auspices of the European Commission and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). Some main principles of COACH have been transferred from the EU-based DYNAMIS2 project, although in a different setting. Both projects emphasise technologies and options that can be realised by 2012 (and beyond) for co-production of hydrogen and electricity via pre-combustion decarbonisation from fossil fuels with safe geological storage of the CO2. It is believed that the European Commission – in due course – will make provisions for similar arrangements with India.A main challenge of CCS – in any context – is the techno-economic aspect of fuel penalty and cost. In addition to the higher investment cost, an energy potential corresponding to 20–30% additional fuel is inherently sacrificed in order to isolate and compress the CO2 stream before it can be injected into a permanent sink. For this reason CCS is entirely policy driven rather than motivated by profit.Although CCS is far more costly and requiring substantially more primary energy, it is likely to assume that India will be forced to either implement CCS or to retire parts of its generating capacity. This suggests that India may become attractive for industrialised countries to make “green” investments in its power sector provided however, that CCS will become eligible for joint mitigation actions beyond the Kyoto treaty that expires by 2012.The energy supply situation of India is seen as a matter of growing concern. In contrast to Europe where the issue of greenhouse gas emissions is high on the political agenda, India seemingly is more focused on cost, energy supply and local pollution. Coal is still the prevalent fuel in the Indian power sector, and is likely to be so in the foreseeable future. This suggests that time is due for India to embark on pre-normative research and technology initiatives in order to pave the ground for a cleaner energy policy in an Indian context. One step in this direction is to gain knowledge on prevalent carbon capture techniques — in theory and via major CCS projects and storage sites.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/1,53
"It is usually taken for granted that photovoltaic pumping technology is well established, presenting a high degree of reliability. However, it is often the case that traditional communities' water supply projects based on photovoltaic pumping systems are flawed because issues related to the local specificities and technology transfer methods are not taken into account. This work makes plain that the conception of the project, availability of water, system configuration, estimation of water demand, technology transfer process, and form of management can be decisive for the longevity of a project.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-for-sustainable-development/vol/13/issue/1,53

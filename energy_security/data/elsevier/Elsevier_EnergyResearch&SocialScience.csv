"This article seeks to nip in the bud four emerging myths about the geopolitics of the rise of renewable energy and the concomitant increase in electricity usage. The article presents alternative perspectives, arguing that (1) the risk of geopolitical competition over critical materials for renewable energy is limited; (2) the resource curse as we know it from the petroleum sector will not necessarily reappear in many countries in connection with renewable energy; (3) transboundary electricity cut-offs will mostly be unsuitable as a geopolitical weapon; and (4) it is not clear that growing use of renewable energy will exacerbate cyber-security risks. In all four areas, the evolving literature could place more emphasis on uncertainty and risks and less on one-sided scenarios and maximization of threats.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"In this Perspective paper we call for attention to the rise of digital platforms in the energy field. The smart grid has laid the ground for – and is increasingly swept up by – attempts to apply the economic, social and technological model of the platform to energy provisioning. The emergent energy platforms offer decentralised, digitally enabled exchanges of energy from distributed resources. They can record flows of energy to administer connections of exchange between household users, develop algorithms to steer the flow of energy from and to household batteries, and enable crowdsourced investments into (small-scale) renewable energy production. We draw up a first typology based on platforms’ physical integration into the energy infrastructure as well as users’ scope for action. To map out the possible implications of these developments, we draw on the burgeoning, interdisciplinary field of platform studies to show how logics of platformization will drive changes to the energy system. We identify the marketization of new domains and activities, the formation of new collectivities and the creation of digital environments that afford new types of engagement with energy assets and other users of the grid. Our main concern is that uncertainties produced by these platforms and their tendency to privatise energy provisioning may slow down the transition towards sustainable energy systems. We therefore call upon energy social scientists to not only examine these developments but use these insights to also participate in the responsible design of the energy grids of the future.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"The speed of sustainability socio-technical transitions is dependent upon many factors. One of these is the amount, skill and success of political incumbent resistance. Australia has been a spectacular example of this resistance – politically, economically and culturally. This article contextualizes the recent effort of a collection of federal MPs, grandly if inaccurately named the ‘Monash Forum’, who advocated for the state-funded construction of a new coal-fired power station. If successful, such a move would consolidate the victories already achieved in slowing the socio-technical transition away from centralized fossil fuel-based electricity generation towards a more decentralized and diverse range of renewable energy generation, storage and supply. The Forum can be used as an object that is ‘good to think with,’ as a prism that lets us see the trajectories of politics, economics and culture. The article offers eight ways that the Monash Forum can be considered, within the broader scope of Australia’s climate deadlock.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"In response to concerns about climate change and fossil fuel reliance, Swedish national policy has set the ambitious goal of a fossil fuel independent transport fleet by 2030, opening up a widespread debate on renewable fuel choice. Across sectors and regions, this debate inspires competing visions for how this transition can be achieved. Using sociotechnical imaginaries for a theoretical background, this paper will examine two competing visions in the case of urban public transport in Linköping, Sweden. While the biogas sociotechnical imaginary is based on the socio-material reality of the existing local infrastructure system, the electricity imaginary is gaining widespread support including from national and international interests. Using interviews with fourteen key actors and document analysis, this paper seeks to understand how local actors understand biogas and electric buses as competing technologies and how they mobilize these antagonistic imaginaries in their own visions of the future. Most often, actors mobilize both the biogas and the electric imaginary alongside each other, suggestion an attempt at reconciling them at the local level. This reconciliation sheds light on the challenge of applying national imaginaries to local cases and indicates that the complexity of multi-level systems must be considered in large scale sustainability transitions.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) have been positioned as a low carbon strategy by the European Union in its Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings (Directive 2010/31/EU). Underlying this directive is that the choice of technical options as well as sources of renewable energy may vary across EU countries and building projects. This article aims to compare the outcomes of NZEB demonstration projects in newly built city districts in Amsterdam, Helsingborg, and Lyon, using insights from strategic niche management theory combined with post-occupancy evaluation. More specifically, the analysis focuses on end-user expectations and experiences with living in energy-neutral city districts and homes, identifying lessons learned. A major conclusion is that the NZEB demonstration projects only facilitated single loop learning of end-users but did not provide an impetus for double loop learning. The findings suggest that NZEB projects need to be redesigned to facilitate more active roles of end-users in order to help realising their full potential in terms of increased energy efficiency and social learning.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"Agent-based modelling has the potential to provide insight into complex energy transition dynamics. Despite a recent emphasis of research on agent-based modelling and on energy transitions, an overview of how the methodology may be of value to understanding transition processes is still missing from the literature. This systematic review evaluates the potential of agent-based modelling to understanding energy transitions from a social-scientific perspective, based on a set of 62 articles. Six topic areas were identified, addressing different components of the energy system: Electricity Market, Consumption Dynamics/ Consumer Behaviour, Policy and Planning, New Technologies/ Innovation, Energy System, Transitions. Distribution of articles across topic areas was indicative of a continuing interest in electricity market related enquiries, and an increasing number of studies in the realm of policy and planning. Based on the relevance of energy transition specific complexities to the choice of ABM as a methodology, four complexity categories (1–4) were identified. Indicating the degree of association between the complexity of energy transitions and ABM’s ability to address these, the categorisation revealed that 35 of the 62 studies directly linked the choice of ABM to energy transition complexities (complexity category 1) or were set in the context of energy transitions (complexity category 2). The review further showed that the greatest potential contribution of ABM to energy transition studies lies in its practical application to decision-making in policy and planning. More interdisciplinary collaboration in model development is recommended to address the discrepancy between the relevance of social factors to modelling energy transitions and the ability of the social sciences to make effective use of ABM.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"Recent years have seen a renewed interest in energy amongst International Relations (IR) scholars. The existing IR literature is characterised by a debate between a realist-inspired ‘geopolitical’ approach that sees energy as a source of zero-sum conflict, and a liberal-influenced ‘global energy governance’ approach which emphasises interdependence and cooperative dynamics. However, by adopting a systemic perspective these IR approaches fail to account for the full range of political dynamics shaping inter-state energy relations. This article consolidates insights from the broader literature on energy politics to develop a new securitisation approach to international energy politics. It argues that energy securitisation – a process where governments frame energy as an existential threat to state interests – is variable and contingent. It occurs in states where energy issues are implicated in economic, regime and/or geopolitical security concerns, and leads governments to adopt nationalistic policy frameworks that result in international conflicts over energy. The utility of this securitisation approach is illustrated with a case study of the divergent energy behaviour of two major energy exporters (Russia and Australia). By accounting for domestic and international dynamics, and explaining rather than assuming the securitisation of energy, this securitisation approach offers more explanatory purchase than existing IR energy theories.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"Microgrids are known to be one of the most effective forms of decentralized energy systems, mainly because of their ability to run independently of the central grid and efficiently integrate a number of distributed energy resources. In terms of a country-wise microgrid market, the United States has the highest capacity share in the world. However, within the country, significant variation exists in the adoption of microgrids by the states. In this context, this paper presents an empirical analysis of the drivers behind high and low microgrid adoption in states across the United States. The results illustrate that the states that frequently experience disasters, and hence have high resilience concerns are more likely to adopt microgrids. On the other hand, higher citizen support for energy choice and pro-environmental attitudes of citizens do not have statistically significant effects on microgrid adoption. By examining the determinants of microgrid adoption in states, this paper provides a basis for understanding the socio-political foundations of the trend of decentralization in the energy system.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"The strategies used by householders for heating and using hot water heating have a significant impact on energy consumption in domestic buildings. A better understanding of the interaction between occupants and hot water heating systems can improve the energy efficiency of a building. This paper maps the interaction between occupants and their current domestic hot water heating systems to provide insights for the design of future thermal energy storage systems. A total of 35 householders from the Midlands region of the UK took part in semi-structured contextual interviews about their current strategies for the provision of hot water and the way they engage with their heating systems. Using the DNAs framework as an analysis lens, drivers, needs and actions relating to the provision of hot water were evaluated and four distinct hot water heating types are presented: On Demand, For All Eventualities, Just Enough and Sunny Days. Findings provide insights into occupants’ behaviour in relation to hot water heating usage and design implications for thermal energy storage technologies.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"The intensive use of information and communication technology (ICT) results in increasing levels of consumption of energy and materials. The use of ICT is widespread among young people, and this paper investigates the everyday practices related to their use of ICT (mainly smart phones and laptops). Based on qualitative studies in the Netherlands and Denmark, we find that energy-intensive use of ICT is encouraged through mutually reinforcing social norms, social-institutional embeddedness and scripts regarding their everyday practices. In addition to a lack of awareness of the environmental impact of ICT, this explains why young people in general find it hard to imagine using ICT less to save energy. It is discussed how the material design (scripts) of ICT, e.g. visual/audio message notifications, supports increased use, but also sometimes are opposed by young people through counter script strategies. More generally, young people often have experiences of (social media) communication as being burdensome due to its extent and social expectations of always being accessible. Future policies should target the social-institutional and material context, instead of the individual user, if the aim is to reduce energy consumption from ICT use. The paper combines a practice theoretical approach with STS concepts that foreground the role of materials in shaping practices.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"Energy infrastructure is closely tied to national development and securing a reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy infrastructure is one of the great challenges for developing as well as developed countries. In this study, we aim to broaden our understanding of energy infrastructure transitions by analyzing how the East Asian way of development affected the energy infrastructure transition process in South Korea. This study focuses on two special features that have attracted much interest in development literature: 1) the strong state as an initiator and enabler of the transition, and 2) technology transfer as a pathway to niche development. Our case study confirms the state’s leading role—based on development-oriented political leadership and elite bureaucracy—in the transition process. However, the government transferred technology and related policies from developed countries, the transition did not go as planned, and it took much longer to deal with the bottlenecks in the private sector. However, in this process, policymakers have shown that they recognize their mistakes, adapted to the environment, and changed the policies. In addition, private companies and customers are evolving as government and external environments change. In other words, the success factors for a long state-led transition seem more related to policy learning and evolution allowing broad public–private sector co-evolution than the typical policy style of strong-state leadership and powerful execution.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"Energy justice is an emerging concept that informs policymakers on the just distribution of, and access to energy services. However, research on how policy grounded in energy justice may facilitate greater intergenerational equity is few and far between. Additionally, energy justice as a decision-making framework has mostly been based in western thought, through its application in developed country contexts. The value of non-Western philosophies in advancing the energy justice literature has received little attention. In this paper, we address these gaps by drawing upon Amartya Sen’s interpretation of the Hindu Bhagavad Gita, using this to conceptualise a temporal energy justice decision-making framework that builds on the Gita’s time-based notions of ‘duty-focused’ and ‘consequence-sensitive’ decision outcomes. We apply this framework to study India’s energy landscape and underlying tensions, largely emanating from a steadfast policy focus on alleviating energy poverty in the short-term whilst also committing to a low carbon energy transition for the future. We advocate for the need to move beyond this dichotomous focus on duty versus consequence, and pursue a policy position reflected in the understanding of realised justice – an inclusive and comprehensive account of just outcomes from both an intra- and inter-generational perspective.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"Women's involvement in decision-making in domestic energy remains an under-researched area, especially in the urban context. This research adopts a gendered perspective in exploring slum rehabilitation housing in India. Based on a household survey and a focus group discussion (FGD), women’s household and working practices are explored in interview narratives and systems analysis. The findings show that the relocation to slum rehabilitation housing (SRH) has radically changed women’s household routines (cooking, comfort, childrearing, working and entertainment practices) and that women are more affected by the relocation than men. Changed practices, poor design of SRH and lack of outdoor space have radically increased electricity use and living costs in all the surveyed households. The economic pressure forces women into lowly paid jobs or informal economy, creating a vicious circle where women’s time poverty further reduces their social capital and opportunities for self-development in terms of education or formal employment. A comparison of SRH typologies shows that building design has great influence both on gendered use of space and electricity use, advocating a courtyard typology. Further, interviews with policy-makers reveal a dis-juncture between the occupant realities and the policy objectives. The paper argues that gender equality can and should be influenced through energy and housing policies and offers a conceptual framework for inclusive SRH to address this dis-juncture.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"This article counters conventional discourses where sustainable energy transitions in the Global South have been broadly linked to top-down policy frameworks, large-scale installations, and donor-driven interventions. It does so by highlighting the roles played by and the potentials of bottom-up, small-scale, and community-driven initiatives in shaping energy transitions in these locations. We shed light on two of these initiatives: a rural, community-based renewable energy project in Thailand, and a community-led social movement that prevented the construction of a coal-fired power plant in the Philippines. Both cases demonstrate how community mobilizations help facilitate sustainable energy transitions in the Global South, despite their many social, political and economic constraints. The analysis draws from concepts of local activism and community engagement on energy transitions, marrying the social movement concept of prefigurative activism with the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries in science and technology studies. This article highlights that valuable insights can be generated from rural- and community-driven renewable energy initiatives and their power to reimagine the futures of energy systems in the Global South.",Volume 49,March 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/49/suppl/C,1
"Around 3 billion people across the world rely on the use of traditional fuels for their energy needs. Nearly all are poor and a majority use traditional inefficient cookstoves that partially combust these fuels and emit harmful carbonaceous pollutants. These traditional cookstoves are a significant contributor to household air pollution, and causes acute public and environmental health implications. To reduce these detrimental effects, clean cooking technologies (clean stoves and clean fuels) have been distributed widely around the world, targeting poor communities. However, sustained uptake of these clean cooking technologies has been tepid. There has been considerable focus on improving the technical design and development of these clean cooking technologies, with less attention paid to the social drivers that either lead or keep people from using the stoves. We argue for greater emphasis on understanding social networks, and their influence on sustained uptake of clean cooking practices amongst poor communities. By drawing from cases in health, microfinance, and clean cooking, we outline a perspective for emphasis on social network analysis in dissemination and implementation strategies of clean cooking practices for poor communities.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"20 years ago, in 1998, Scientific American published a paper by Colin J. Campbell and Jean H. Laherrère titled “The End of Cheap Oil” [1], starting a debate on oil depletion continuing to the present day. It was the return of a viewpoint on oil depletion which had been proposed more than 40 years before by Marion King Hubbert [2]⁠ and, in later years, largely forgotten. In their paper, Campbell and Laherrère updated Hubbert’s model with new reserve estimates and proposed that the world’s crude oil production would peak around 2004–2005, and then start an irreversible decline. Shortly afterward, Colin Campbell proposed the term “peak oil” for the highest global oil production level. The term was to become popular over the following decade, generating a true movement of ideas sometimes called the “peak oil movement.” Today, these predictions turn out to have been only partially correct, mainly because the role of “non-conventional” oil was underestimated. The peak oil movement seems to have faded away, while the concept seems to have disappeared from the debate and to be commonly described has having been “wrong.” The present paper reviews the cycle of the peak oil movement, examining how the peak oil concept was understood with the public and the decision makers and what caused its diffusion and its demise, at least up to the present time.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Many Southeast Asian countries are considering the adoption of nuclear energy to meet the rising energy demands and achieve energy efficiency. Considering the emerging regional salience of nuclear energy, this study seeks to understand the public’s media consumption patterns regarding nuclear-related information, and credibility perceptions of nuclear-related information sources in countries that are at a nascent stage of nuclear development. Focus groups were conducted with citizens aged between 18 and 69 from five Southeast Asian countries – Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Overall, the findings suggest that the participants utilize communication channels in a complementary manner to receive and seek nuclear-related information. Participants also evaluated the credibility of individuals and organizations that convey nuclear-related information based on their trustworthiness and nuclear expertise. The findings provide practical implications in terms of policy implementation, as well as public communication of nuclear-related information. Directions for future research were also discussed.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Over the past decades, a profound energy transition has begun. In 2014, the EU agreed to increase the share of renewable energy sources in its final energy consumption to at least 27 percent by 2030. This goal indicates that the transition will continue even as the speed of the transition is contested. To an even greater extent debates over the social character of the future energy regime also persist. This article argues that the energy transition is increasingly taking the shape of a passive revolution in a Gramscian sense, i.e. that transnational energy corporations (TNECs) are strengthening their efforts to dominate the new energy regime. Aside from its empirical focus, this paper also contributes to the attempts to better understand the role of politics, power and conflicts in energy transitions. Gramsci’s integral understanding of structure and agency and the mediation of material interests and discursive constructions in struggles over hegemony offer a novel framework for the analysis of energy transitions.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"“Range anxiety,” defined as the psychological anxiety a consumer experiences in response to the limited range of an electric vehicle, continues to be labelled and presented as one of the most pressing barriers to their mainstream diffusion. As a result, academia, policymakers and even industry have focused on addressing the range anxiety barrier in order to accelerate adoption. Much literature recognizes that range anxiety is increasingly psychological, rather than technical, in its nature. However, we argue in this paper that even psychological and technical explanations are incomplete. We examine range anxiety through Hirschman’s Rhetoric of Reaction, which supposes that conservative forces may oppose change by propagating theses related to jeopardy, perversity, and futility. To do so, we use three qualitative methods to understand the role of range anxiety triangulated via a variety of perspectives: 227 semi-structured interviews with experts at 201 institutions, a survey with nearly 5000 respondents, and 8 focus groups, all across 17 cities in the five Nordic countries. We find evidence where consumers and experts use and perpetuate the rhetoric of reaction, particularly the jeopardy thesis. We conclude with a reexamination of the policies geared to assuage range-based barriers, which a construction of range anxiety as a rhetorical excuse would render as ineffective or inefficient, as well as future implications for diffusion theory.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"In this article we demonstrate how existing scenario-planning and forecasting methods employed in the energy sector envision, prioritise and limit possible futures. We propose that ‘social practice imaginaries’ can be mobilised to develop alternative future scenarios grounded in changing everyday life. To undertake this we critically interrogate the sociotechnical imaginary given rise through an Australian smart technology scenario-planning exercise, which asked: ‘what might Australia’s electricity sector look like in 2050?’ Proposing that this question needs to be reframed to account for the question of ‘what might everyday practices look like in 2050?’ we experiment with a ‘stay-at-home pets’ scenario. We draw on secondary data on pet care trends and a decade of ethnographic research with Australian households. Through this example, we demonstrate how viewing futures through pet care and entertainment practices shifts the conceptualisation of the energy problems that the sector seeks to address through smart technology deployments. We conclude by emphasising how this social practice imaginary expands opportunities and pathways for understanding and intervening in possible futures, and call for further analysis through this conceptual lens.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Municipal policies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help to mitigate climate change. It is often unclear why cities would adopt such policies, however, given that the benefits from climate mitigation will be felt globally, rather than exclusively locally. Studies have identified a rationale for urban mitigation and energy policies rooted in local co-benefits, such as improvements in local environmental quality or job creation. Here we explore the possibility of financial co-benefits: whether municipal climate policies lead to an enhanced creditworthiness. This would translate into reduced borrowing costs for other infrastructure projects. Interviewing key informants from cities, investment firms and rating agencies, we find that rating agencies do consider climate policies in their ratings. This clearly applies to those climate policies that can result in demonstrable net economic gains to the municipality. However even those mitigation and energy policies that come at net costs to cities can have positive impacts on rating assessments, either because the policies are seen as reducing regulatory risks, or because they send positive signals to those investors having global sustainability agendas. Interestingly, those least aware of these factors appear to be city leaders themselves. This suggests a need to make them aware of how rating agencies and investors positively view climate mitigation policies.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Residential solar photovoltaic (PV) customers typically obtain price quotes directly from installers, a process with high consumer search costs that enable price dispersion and can discourage adoption. Recently, however, customers are increasingly shopping for PV using third-party online platforms that make it easier to obtain and compare quotes from multiple installers. While early evidence indicates that these platforms make the PV market more transparent and lower prices, the literature suggests that market outcomes are critically linked to detailed aspects of platform design. In this study, we econometrically analyze a unique dataset of quotes offered in the online PV marketplace EnergySage to investigate how four changes to the platform design have influenced quote prices and transaction prices. We find that the largest reductions in quote prices ($0.11/ W) and transaction prices ($0.15/W) were associated with the introduction of a price guidance information feature for installers. While educating and informing customers has repeatedly emerged as a policy priority for bolstering PV markets, these results suggest that the same should be true on the supply side. We also find that customers are willing to pay higher transaction prices for systems with higher-quality panels, dispelling concerns that online PV marketplaces lead to a “race to the bottom” phenomenon by emphasizing price at the expense of quality.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) are technologies which aim at mitigating climate change and saving fossil resources: CO2 emissions from industrial plants are captured and stored underground (CCS) or used for the manufacturing of products (CCU). In contrast to CCS, CCU is less about the reduction of CO2 emissions, since the global demand for feedstock CO2 to be used for CCU products is considerably lower than the CO2 emissions produced worldwide. Moreover, the CO2 is only temporarily stored until the disposal of the CCU products. Instead, a reduction of fossil resources in product manufacturing is the primary goal for CCU. The successful roll-out of CCS and CCU is not solely determined by technical feasibility but also depends on public acceptance. Research has shown that acceptance of energy technologies is impacted by laypersons’ attitudes. So far, little is known about differences in affective and cognitive evaluations of CCU in comparison to CCS. To address this research gap, an online survey was conducted in Germany (n = 449), in which affective and cognitive evaluation profiles for CCS and CCU were compared. Also, it was explored whether attitudes towards CCS are predictive of CCU acceptance. Results revealed basically similar evaluation profiles for CCS and CCU but CCU was rated significantly more positively. Comparing results for CCS supporters and opponents, it was found that CCS supporters rated CCU similarly positive whereas CCS opponents evaluated CCU significantly better than CCS. The findings can be used for communication concepts tailored to laypeople’s requirements and concerns and yield implications for industrial policy-making.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Understanding public responses to environmental policies can help in achieving a move towards more renewable energy. Focusing on two types of public responses to a policy, namely public acceptance and public support, this study utilizes a survey of car owners (N = 1422) to explore public responses to an environmental transport policy in Sweden. The results demonstrate higher levels of public acceptance than support for the policy and that adopters of Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs) are more prone to accept and support the policy by expressing higher intentions for continuous AFV adoption. Results of regression analyses show that policy acceptance can be explained by environmental beliefs and previous experience with AFVs. In addition, public support is also explained by public acceptance, even when controlling for other factors, which lends support to the deduction that policy acceptance can be theorized as antecedent to policy support. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding different types of public responses to an energy policy in order to recognize drivers for, and barriers against, successfully implementing a policy and communicating it with the public.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Energy, and its use in society, can be understood and conceptualised in multiple different ways, emphasising different sets of values and attributes. In this paper, we examine how members of the public conceptualise energy, showing that a particularly salient frame is one of energy as a need and basic right. To orient our analysis we use the concept of framing, as rooted in sociological and psychological literature on framing effects and decision-making. The qualitative analysis draws from two UK datasets. The first consists of five focus groups (n = 37) examining public perceptions of energy transitions. The second dataset consists of four deliberative workshops (n = 46) exploring public perceptions of energy storage. We find that energy is explicitly discussed as a basic need because of its perceived role in ensuring survival, good health and a decent life. This is particularly salient when considering the wellbeing of vulnerable groups. We suggests that ‘energy as a need’ provides a framework for people’s evaluation of proposed changes to the wider energy system including how energy is produced, consumed and governed, and discuss implications for policy and practitioners that seek to ensure low-carbon energy transitions are successful, inclusive and socially acceptable.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Building upon recent literature, we combine a novel spatiotemporal variable with spatial methods to investigate and quantify the influence of the built environment and jurisdictional boundaries on spatial peer-effects (SPEs) in inner-city areas. We focus on the Hartford Capital region, using detailed data at block-group and PV system levels for the years 2005-2013. This region is part of a state, Connecticut, actively engaged in supporting PV system at residential level. Adoption of PV systems varies substantially, and state policies are mediated by town-level regulations. We initially employ typology analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of the block groups with higher adoption rates. We then use panel FE and spatial estimations to determine the existence of spill-overs of SPEs beyond town boundaries. Our estimations suggest that new PV systems have a more limited spatiotemporal influence in inner-cities. We identify spatial spill-overs from neighboring block groups even between towns, suggesting that SPEs transcend municipal barriers. We do not find significant results for built-environment, although we identify several data limitations. Our results suggest that centralized, non-voluntary support policies may have larger effects if implemented beyond town-level, and that SPEs change their determination power depending on the underlying built environment.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Distributed energy storage technologies (DES) are expected to help in decarbonising the power sector, decentralising power sources and meeting the mismatch between the produced and consumed energy. However, the likelihood of the use and acceptance of these technologies will partly hinge on public perceptions. Here, we present results of three focus groups and dialogue from the city of Leeds (UK) held with members the lay public with and without personal experience of technology (photovoltaic panels) about public perceptions of distributed energy storage technologies at household and community scale. We apply and adapt the Energy Cultures framework, which was initially developed for understanding energy behaviours as mediated by individual psychological factors, by practice-based, energy-related culture and infrastructural elements. Accordingly, we connect what people think, do and have in energy contexts, to better understand perceptions of DES technologies as part of a broader renewable energy landscape (culture) that is both materially and socially constructed. We show how a variety of elements such as forms of energy consumption; costs; expectations of family members; previous experiences; perceptions of government and the municipal authority; and expectations about the technologies, are likely to shape acceptance and adoption of battery storage at the household and community level.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Citizen investment in distributed renewables is becoming a key feature of low carbon transition in some countries, opening up new sources of capital and offering benefits for social support. Little is known about citizen investor preferences outside of mature markets such as Denmark and Germany, or if the experiences in these countries can be replicated elsewhere. Based on a survey of 1280 Irish citizens, 1000 of whom participated in a choice experiment, we find a high level of interest in investing in these technologies. This is particularly the case among high-income households with some investment experience. Investment amounts, however, are low compared to equity required for large projects, suggesting that citizen investors will not be a significant source of finance in these cases. Key barriers include lack of savings and no access to loan finance. A majority of citizens are highly risk-averse, and are motivated by financial attributes such as return and minimum investment holding period. Our findings suggest that developer-led projects may provide more opportunities for citizen investment, especially for large projects, and that significant policy interventions would be required targeting early-stage project risks to mobilise citizen investment in fully community-owned schemes.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"The transition of residential energy markets following liberalisation has enhanced the development of new marketing strategies in order to increase consumers’ activity in the market, as well as to satisfy current climate change policies. This work explores the relationship between consumer preferences for energy services and participation in loyalty programs as a new marketing strategy in competitive energy markets. A conceptual framework of membership in loyalty program options is developed and empirically tested. In addition to consumer preferences for energy services extracted by principal component analysis, explanatory variables in the multinomial regression model also include other control variables. An empirical analysis is conducted on a sample of residential electricity consumers of the largest energy supplier in Slovenia, a new entrant in the electricity market. This research suggests three main findings. First, consumer preferences defining consumer types significantly differ across the loyalty program consumer groups, which calls for tailoring the supply offer to respond to different consumer segments. Second, members of the regular loyalty program option prefer a good relationship with the supplier, while for members of the advanced loyalty program option, integrated energy services play a bigger role. Third, loyalty programs could be effectively used to target the advanced segment of consumers with an offer of integrated energy services, including energy efficiency and green energy, thereby contributing to the mandatory energy savings imposed on energy suppliers and the national environmental sustainability targets.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"This article employs a power structure research approach and exploratory network analysis to describe the differing stances on climate action that existed within the United States elite energy policy-planning network during efforts to generate climate legislation in 2009. These divisions are explored in relation to the structural location of the coal industry, other energy sectors, and environmental organizations within the network of director interlocks. My key findings are that coal interests are well integrated into the policy-planning network with major coal producers and reserve holders most connected to ultra-conservative business policy groups and industry associations committed to climate denial while a “coal coalition” of coal-related interests provide linkages to influential moderate conservative groups and industry associations taking a conciliatory stance on climate action. The largest oil and gas firms vary more than the coal industry in their affiliations. In general, policy groups that support climate action are on average significantly less central within the overall EPPN compared to those that do not. I discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the boundaries of United States and global climate policy formation.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"A transformation in energy structures and governance models are required to meet the needs of communities living in rural and remote areas and particularly for those subject to energy and economic poverty. New models must be reflexive to global climate concerns, align with social, economic and environmental agendas of national, state, and local governments, and be compatible with embedded energy infrastructure. Decentralised solar solutions are a resilient technology which can support energy transformation to spatially, economically and socially disadvantaged communities yet the deployment of this technology is hamstrung by path dependencies including policy frameworks, business models and infrastructure. In this study, the multi-level perspective has been used to examine energy transformation within rural and remote communities in India through interviews with regime and niche level actors. We identify various barriers impeding successful deployment of decentralised solar PV including a disconnect between policy makers and implementers, poor coordination within and between actors, and limited institutional focus and competence. To support a successful transition to off-grid solar based regimes for rural and remote communities, participants suggested strong political determination, setting enabling policy frameworks, and implementing a collaborative ecosystem with businesses, system suppliers, financial intermediaries, distribution companies, civil society and end users.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Mitigating global climate change requires decarbonizing the electricity sector, but the optimal strategy for doing so is not obvious. As power plants fueled by coal and petroleum are phased out, other generation technologies must fill the gap. While technically feasible, many low-carbon technologies are currently expensive – though costs may fall with experience. As an alternative, natural gas-fired power plants provide lower-carbon electricity – and cheaply if gas is abundant. The least-cost portfolio of generation technologies depends on several uncertain parameters. This paper presents a stylized model of the global electricity sector and evaluates several decarbonization strategies focused on three bridge technologies – natural gas, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and nuclear – over the period 2015–2050. With constraints on total demand for electricity and penetration of renewables, I find that the results are sensitive to the learning curve for CCS, the cost of natural gas, and the social cost of carbon. Depending on the true state of the world, decision-makers may find either natural gas power plants or CCS to be least-cost options for decarbonization portfolios. The expected value of information from resolving uncertainty is hundreds of billions of dollars, indicating high social benefits from investments into scientific research.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"This study contributes to an understanding of how the distribution of benefits and costs of energy production should occur. In doing so, this study draws attention to an uneasy tension between urban planning practice focused on urban consolidation and the promotion of solar photovoltaic panels in Australia’s capital cities. Specifically, this study investigates the impact of built environment and feed-in tariffs (FiTs) on the installation of solar rooftop photovoltaic (PV) in Australia’s capital cities. It uses a dynamic panel data model to analyse a unique dataset of solar PV panel installations at the postcode level for Australia’s capital cities over the period 2001–2015. The results of this study indicate that denser built environments can detract from solar PV panel installations in the short-run and in the long-run. These effects are distinct from the socioeconomic status of an area. Specifically, the results indicate that while increases in the density of the built environment detract from solar panel installations, these changes in the built environment appear to be more than offset by FiTs. The results point to the need to mitigate the risk of energy disadvantage entrenchment through urban consolidation policy.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"This paper critically analyzes the disjuncture between rural electrification initiatives, utilization and socioeconomic development resulting from development of small hydropower (SHP) operations in rural Yunnan Province. Across China, a contemporary rapid and sustained proliferation of SHP is driven by government-led programs endorsing the technology as a means to provide energy for isolated communities in areas where grid connectivity is deficient or absent. Through SHP development, rural electrification programs (REP’s) are purported to raise quality-of-life indicators in some of the country’s poorest and most marginalized areas. Currently, there is a significant dearth of research critically analyzing the success or failures of SHP based REP’s in China to improve livelihoods for ethnic minority communities in rural and remote areas. This paper adds to a shallow body of China based research by analyzing outcomes of SHP development through a comparative study undertaken in two rural village communities in the upper Nu River Valley. The study analyzed a range of quantitative economic data before undertaking a suite of qualitative methods such as participant observation, household surveys, semi-structured interviews and focus groups, staggered over multiple field visits. Findings indicate substantial scope exists for SHP based REP’s to achieve stated objectives for improving socioeconomic indicators in rural and remote communities. Due to a range of challenges, however, projects often underachieve or further marginalize residents, commonly mired by failures in strategic planning, lack of implementation frameworks and genuine engagement with community members. A number of recommendations are offered as pathways to improve SHP based REP’s as a means to provide conditions for more equitable modes of socioeconomic development across rural and marginal China.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Lanterns, homes systems, hot water systems and micro-grids based on small-scale solar have become prominent ways to address the energy access challenge. As momentum grows for this form of energy transition this paper draws together research on small-scale solar in six different countries – Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Mozambique, Sri Lanka and South Africa – to argue for a need to understand how, when, and for whom solar provides energy access. It argues that an assemblage perspective can provide vital insights into the diversity and dynamism of energy access. The paper demonstrates that the diverse ways in which solar provides energy access is a function of the flexibility/fixity of the socio-technical assemblage and the de/centralisation of agency.The central thesis of this paper is that energy access is fluid and ever changing and we need fluid, easily maintainable, locally modifiable ‘assemblages’ for providing such access. Using this perspective, we find three common features of solar energy access across our case studies. First, there are significant gaps between what solar projects are designed to achieve and what they deliver, which are highly contingent on the flexibility of their structure and the decentralisation of agency within them. Second, access needs to endure continuously. Third, to foster enduring access, projects should embed logics of improvisation.This paper is based on six separate qualitative research projects conducted during 2010–2016. It draws data from 482 interviews, 91 home tours and 12 group discussions.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Air quality action plans (AQAPs) are emerging as a promising governance tool that cities employ in pursuit of clean air transitions. Representing a city’s blueprint for achieving a particular air quality objective, these plans both describe a particular vision of what a blue sky urban future should look like and provide the mechanism by which the city aims to achieve this vision. As such, AQAPs constitute an important shift from a highly fragmented and instrumental environmental policy towards an integrated strategy guided by a long-term vision. This article unpacks the visionary fabric undergirding AQAPs as well as their media representations by means of content analysis. Using three concrete case studies–London, Hong Kong, and San Francisco–the analysis is guided by Jasanoff and Kim’s concept of sociotechnical imaginaries. The concept states that societies hold collective visions about desirable futures that are institutionally stabilized and publicly performed, ultimately coming to shape policy agendas and developmental trajectories. The application of this concept to AQAPs contributes in two ways. First, it addresses questions about the similarity and fragmentation of environmental policy in the global arena. By providing evidence for the similarity of imaginary structures between cities, it supports observations of a striking uniformity in governance patterns of environmental policy. Second, the article discusses what sociotechnical implications AQAPs may have for the city. It does so by elaborating on five storylines driving imaginaries of urban futures and pointing out the possibilities and limitations they delimit: 1. the government-up-front, 2. the new economy of clean air, 3. the technological fix, 4. remaking the ‘good’ urban citizen, and 5. the science-policy interplay.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"Energy utility firms operate under varying mandates throughout most of the world and typically must operate reliably with long planning cycles and requirements to meet bureaucratic scrutiny and regulatory toll gating to achieve both discrete plan approvals as well as their ongoing licenses to operate. One vehicle for gaining external insights and involving the stakeholders is crowdsourcing. Energy utility firms have a set of distinguishing characteristics (i.e. regulatory processes and stakeholder groups) that they must consider when implementing crowdsourcing activities to aid their planning and innovation strategies. To achieve constructive participation requires understanding and engaging the motivations of the population from which a firm wishes to draw input. We assert that customers’ interest, facilitated by digital age communication channels, can provide utility operators with an accessible, valuable resource to assist a wide range of planning and innovation activities. We use the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) lens, grounded by a set of in-depth interviews with utility industry professionals, to articulate motivations for members of the external customer community to provide value to the firms through crowdsourcing activities. We develop five propositions that collectively identify how energy firms should use SDT elements to design crowdsourcing activities.",Volume 48,February 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/48/suppl/C,2
"While various approaches are shown to be effective in reducing electricity use of end consumers during an intervention, few studies continue to track participants to evaluate whether these effects last and whether the same factors are still impactful in the long term. The present paper describes results one year after a behavior change intervention, called Social Power, aimed at reducing household electricity consumption using a gamified mobile application connected to a household’s smart meter. Between February and May 2016, forty-two households in two Swiss cities were actively involved and monitored along with corresponding control group of forty households. The intervention engaged app users in a neighborhood challenge to complete electricity saving activities and realize their progress through electricity use visualization. One year after the intervention, electricity consumption was measured, and follow-up online surveys measured reported behavior and perceived injunctive norms of the participants. During the intervention, participants significantly reduced their electricity use, with respect to both historical consumption and the control groups. However, after one year it was found that the electricity savings achieved during the intervention were not maintained. In contrast, the participants reported their behavior as more efficient compared to before the intervention and still perceived the impact of the intervention in their community. This counter intuitive relation between the three measured variables is discussed, along with possible strategies to maintain the positive effects achieved in the short-term.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"Deep geothermal energy can be used to generate electric power and is seen as a promising source of renewable energy. However, geothermal technology is also controversial. Existing studies on public responses to geothermal energy focus on the question of support for the technology, and on the identification of reasons and arguments that cause opposition.In this article, we will shed light on the different responses to innovative geothermal energy technologies at the local level. We rely on the assumption that these responses are rendered visible through different framings of the technology. We conducted four focus groups in two German communities with a total of 27 participants. Our case study approach reveals the diversity of local understandings of geothermal energy, which differ within and between communities. Our analysis shows that local actors do not primarily frame deep geothermal energy as a renewable energy. Instead, they tend to see it as an emerging technology that still requires further development, or view it in terms of its possible environmental impact. We argue that by taking into consideration the diversity of frames, it is possible to gain a better understanding of potential controversies regarding the technology, and to develop deep geothermal energy projects in a way that aligns with the needs of local actors.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"Energy system and integrated assessment models (IAMs) are widely used techniques for knowledge production to assess costs of future energy pathways and economic effects of energy/climate policies. With their increased use for policy assessment and increasing dominance in energy policy science, such models attract increasing criticism. In the last years, such models – especially the highly complex IAMs, have been accused of being arbitrary. We challenge this view and argue that the models and their assumptions are not arbitrary, but they are normative and reflect the modelers’ understanding of the functioning of the society, the environment-societal relations and respective appropriate scientific tools and theories – in short: models are shaped by discursive structures, reproducing and reinforcing particular societal discourses. We identify 9 distinct paths, all relating to crucial model decisions, via which discourses enter models: for each of these decisions, there are multiple “correct” answers, in the sense that they can be justified within a particular discourse. We conclude that decisions of modelers about the structure and about assumptions in energy modeling are not arbitrary but contingent to the discursive context the modeler is related to. This has two implications. First, modelers and consumers of model output must reflect on what a model and its assumptions represent, and not only whether are they correct. Second, models hardly need to add more (mathematical) complexity, but rather be reduced and simplified so that they can continue to fulfill their main function as formalized and powerful instruments for thought experiments about future energy pathways.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"This study examines the effects of a novel construct – energy insecurity – on adverse health in a community-based sample in New York City. Using a 2015 cross-sectional study of 2,494 households in Washington Heights, we described the socio-demographic characteristics of energy insecure households and examined the association between energy insecurity and health outcomes using logistic regression models. Twenty-seven percent of participants were energy insecure. Racial/ethnic minorities, households with children, long-term neighborhood residents, and those with poor housing conditions were more likely to be energy insecure; meanwhile, middle income households were not fully protect against energy insecurity. Energy insecurity was significantly associated with poor respiratory, mental health, and sleep outcomes; it was not associated with metabolic disorders, accidents, or neighborhood violence and cohesion. This study indicates that energy insecurity may explain some existing respiratory and mental health-related disparities in vulnerable populations. More research on energy insecurity is needed along with refinement of its measurement.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"This study aims to construct a composite index for measuring the vulnerability to resource curse in selected resource-rich countries through an analysis of the diverse factors, ranging from economic to governmental, social and political, that affect the resource curse phenomenon and its impacts. The proposed Resource Curse Vulnerability Index (RCVI) is based on 9 sub-indicators, namely government effectiveness, voice and accountability, political stability, rule of law, natural resources rent, GDP growth, human development level, transparency level and state fragility index. We perform the calculations and present the RCVI values of 55 countries in the time interval from 2005 to 2015. This study also provides an analysis of the RCVI values and rankings for the countries over the associated time interval. These results point to a clustering of the countries: A number of countries can be identified as low-RCVI countries that are principally not vulnerable to the resource curse, whereas a number of other countries are high-RCVI countries who suffer heavily from the resource curse. The more interesting group is the medium-RCVI countries that share geographical and cultural aspects with high-RCVI countries, however, have achieved substantially better performances, by taking appropriate steps to address their internal stability as well as economic situations.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"This article focuses on describing the different domestic and non-domestic practices and infrastructures through which heating is organized in domestic settings. Based on recent scholarly work interested in researching the interlinks between domestic heating use and non-domestic energy practices and infrastructures, it proposes to understand domestic heating as the practical outcome of existing heating ecologies, which are defined as the dynamic interrelations of in-home and out-home heating infrastructures and practices. The argument empirically unfolds using material from six months of ethnographic fieldwork that focused on a heater replacement policy program in central and southern Chile. Using the data we collected from participant observation and follow-up interviews, we describe the installation phase and establishment of new less polluting heaters, as well as how the installation of those new heaters problematizes and redefines preexisting heating ecologies that constitute domestic and non-domestic practices and infrastructures linked to firewood heating. We focus on two specific aspects of this change which proved to be particularly relevant in terms of the adoption of the new heaters: first, the change in the infrastructures and practices of fuel provision and, second, the change in the infrastructures and practices of maintenance and repair. The article ends by suggesting that further understanding of heating ecologies — their dynamics and changes — could be a critical element for explaining the success or failure of low carbon domestic technological transitions and policy intervention.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3

ACT allows us to depart from the current mean-field approach and explicitly explore the effects of heterogeneity, leaders, and networks on the transition. Two key finding are (1) the importance of local communities and (2) leaders can both encourage and discourage the energy transition; a finding that nuances existing literature on critical transitions.

"Public acceptance of renewable energy technologies (RETs) is critical to the broader adoption of these technologies and reducing the role of fossil fuels in electricity generation. Recent investigations into the public engagement processes surrounding RET projects reveal certain procedural deficits, especially concerning procedural fairness and stakeholder trust. With this in mind, we analyze two engagement processes that led to the Block Island Wind Farm, the first operational offshore wind farm in the United States. Through semi-structured interviews we identify certain procedural techniques that allowed process leaders to first build public trust in themselves, then in the process, and ultimately in the outcome. This chain of trust was fostered through informal efforts of process leaders to meet stakeholder expectations concerning process leaders’ ability to work for the public interest, provide meaningful engagement opportunities, and to produce non-discriminatory outcomes. This case study highlights the potential of such informal actions to meet stakeholder expectations and build trust, while also empirically demonstrating specific techniques that future process leaders could employ to increase stakeholder acceptance of RETs.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"The study aims to identify residence groups that are highly vulnerable to fuel poverty in the urban area of a South Korean city. Thereby, the paper emphasizes that fuel poverty problems occur in different ways according to the social and spatial contexts and thus need a more contextualized policy approach beyond the simplistic criteria of household income and heating cost. To fully capture the meaning of cold homes, an empirical dataset of thermal efficiency of individual dwellings and actual heating in a residential area in Seoul, South Korea is examined along with the tenure type and the ownership attributes. The analyses reveal that the amount of actual heating energy consumption did not show any clear relation with the thermal efficiency of housing or the tenure type. Additionally, considerably inefficient dwellings like old, detached houses are occupied by elderly owners who often lack both the financial capability and intention to properly maintain their properties. The result indicates that people who are living in cold homes are not always confined to poor residents living in rented homes.

"Psychological aspects of living with nuclear energy and technology have interested researchers since their inception, yet a review of the research to date is yet to appear. Following an historical overview of the literature highlighting general thematic and methodological trends, this paper reports on a systematised review of qualitative and mixed methods research on psychological aspects of living with nuclear energy and technology. The historical overview shows how early studies focused on the psychological impacts of the atomic bombs, and living with the spectre of nuclear war. Later research often explored psychological aspects of living with civilian technologies such as nuclear power, and was typically quantitative in approach. Recently, the qualitative and mixed methods literature has expanded. In our systematised review, 26 qualitative and mixed methods studies were found to report on psychological experiences such as living near nuclear power plants and living through a nuclear accident, with common themes described including a lack of trust in authorities, the importance of biography in constituting psychological experience, and factors such as familiarity and sense of place in mediating perceptions.

"This study focuses on the power of economic frames in shaping public perceptions on renewable energy. We use panel survey with embedded experimental treatments that randomly assign different economic frames for the costs and benefits of renewable energy. We find that economic frames affect how people think about renewable energy and framing renewable energy policies in terms of costs, i.e. high electricity bills, has more impact on attitudes than framing it in terms of economic benefits. Positive frames in which renewable energy is linked to greater job creation and economic development are less effective. We theorize this asymmetrical framing effect may be happening because individuals evaluate the direct economic costs to themselves to be more important than broad, dispersed economic benefits to society. It may also be because people generally have more information about the benefits of renewable energy but less so about the personal economic costs. When exposed to information that renewable energy might be directly costly to them, individuals react to the negative treatment more. There has been relatively little systematic experimental research on renewable energy attitudes and as such our study makes an important contribution to the literature by examining the relative effectiveness of economic cost and benefit frames on public opinion toward different dimensions of renewable energy. Our findings may also inform policymaking by emphasizing the power of couching renewable energy in ways that individuals can connect with directly and on a personal level.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"This paper seeks to expand an emerging, multi-disciplinary body of work about tradeoffs in the agriculture-oil and gas nexus by offering evidence of the ways that farm and ranch operators experienced and negotiated costs and benefits of hosting oil and gas in three U.S. oil and gas plays. We report results of mail survey sent to landowners in four rural counties in three U.S. oil and gas regions (Marcellus, Powder River Basin and Bakken) and specifically data from farmers and ranchers about perceptions and experiences of the agriculture-oil and gas nexus (n = 96). The data provided through closed- and open-ended questions suggest, from the perspective of those hosting energy infrastructure on farms and ranches, oil and gas development has enhanced agriculture operations and rural livelihoods but is not without negative impacts or tradeoffs. We introduce the balancing act as a useful framework for considering tradeoffs associated with hosting extractive industries as it allows space for the “balance” between economic activities to be impossible, aspirational or achievable. The study observes that mechanisms through which positive and negative effects operate vary according to agricultural context. Implications for research and practice in the agriculture-energy nexus are discussed.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"The question of whether wind turbines cause a range of adverse health effects has emerged as a key issue in social controversies over wind farms and become a topic of debate in the scientific literature. We review the literature from the perspective of Science and Technology Studies (STS) to examine the experimental evidence and argumentative reasoning constituting three main explanations for how wind turbines impact health: 1) Exposure to infrasound directly causes adverse physiological effects, 2) Exposure to audible noise is associated with annoyance and sleep disturbance, and 3) Psychogenic factors act as mediators to adverse effects. In addition to technical and pragmatic arguments, the debate consists of value-based arguments about the desirability of wind energy, how precautionary development should be, what counts as a valid health issue in public policy, and what counts as valid evidence in health research. Thus, it encompasses the conflicting social commitments and environmental priorities of the wider wind energy debate and the politics of evidence in the health sciences. It suggests the controversy is unlikely to be settled by science but that an STS perspective can provide insights to foster governance that more effectively addresses the complexity of health issues in wind energy transitions.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"Smart meters are a crucial infrastructural feature of a modernizing grid. Smart meters enable dynamic rate structures, a wide range of smart home technologies, energy use feedback, and greater use of distributed renewable energy. Yet, ratepayers are often unfamiliar with smart meters and their benefits, have ambivalent or negative attitudes toward them, and may outright oppose their use. Past research has identified numerous factors that influence acceptance and engagement. However, these factors are tested in isolation and only partially representative of the broader literature on energy technologies. In this study, we compare the relative effect of an expanded range of factors on smart meter acceptance and engagement. We use a survey (N = 609) of homeowners in Ithaca, New York who are part of an upcoming smart meter rollout. We find that, ceteris paribus, familiarity and climate change risk perceptions have the greatest effect on smart meter acceptance, while smart meter acceptance, age, and income have the strongest effect on engagement. Our findings have two primary implications: (1) outreach and communication should focus on increasing familiarity and demonstrating the climate benefits of smart meter enabled products and services; and (2) that outreach and communication is insufficient to increase uptake by all segments of the population.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"Political science research suggests that political party communications often have a strong effect on people’s positions on political issues. However, studies on support for nuclear energy have hitherto largely ignored party-political factors, especially in multiparty contexts, focusing instead on psychometric variables such as risk perception, benefit perception, and trust. This article analyzes if and how people use party cues when determining their support for nuclear energy. We conducted a public opinion survey in Belgium in 2015, which is representative for the population on age, gender, education and level of urbanization. Our results indicate that parties have a net-effect on support for nuclear energy although the effect is modest compared to the effects of the psychometric variables. Furthermore, we show that partisan cue taking occurs more amongst voters of parties that have a clear and opposing position on nuclear energy (i.e. the issue owning parties and the policy defending parties). Cue taking voters of these parties became somewhat more extreme in their support for nuclear energy in the direction advocated by their preferred party. Hence, parties seem to have a polarizing impact on public opinion on nuclear energy. Furthermore, partisan cue taking on nuclear energy occurred more amongst respondents more knowledgeable/strongly involved on the issue of nuclear than amongst those less knowledgeable/less involved.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"Based on data from a large-scale survey (n=3400) conducted in Germany, we analyze citizens’ acceptance and protest intentions regarding the construction of new power plants for renewable energy production. We differentiate between wind energy, solar energy, and biomass energy; natural gas is used as a reference category. We measure protest intentions and acceptance regarding the construction of new power plants within a 10-kilometer radius of respondents’ place of residence. Protest and acceptance are explained by several competing theoretical determinants such as specific attitudes towards each energy source, general attitudes towards climate change, social norms, the “not-in-my-backyard” phenomenon, place attachment, and conditional cooperation. We use decomposition models used in labor market research to study endowment, discrimination, and characteristics effects related to different attitudinal dimensions and their influence on acceptance and protest intentions. Our results show more positive attitudes, less protest intentions, and a stronger acceptance of solar energy, followed by wind energy, biomass energy, and natural gas. Theory comparison reveals, for instance, that “not-in-my-backyard” beliefs have high explanatory power, climate change concern is only relevant for the acceptance of wind energy and solar energy, and place attachment seems to be a useful concept for explaining protest intentions. The decomposition models indicate that attitudes are strong determinants of acceptance and protest intentions where, in addition to endowment effects, we also find some indications of discrimination effects (i.e., different weights of attitudinal dimensions) and characteristics effects (i.e., effects of respondents’ characteristics). Finally, we discuss the policy implications of these results.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"Even when the benefits seem to outweigh the costs, many building owners do not invest in energy efficiency. Here a framework is presented for understanding energy efficiency investment decisions drawing on methods from behavioral decision research. The approach begins with a normative analysis that characterizes how building owners should behave, compares this to interview and survey data from decision-makers, then concludes with policy recommendations suggesting how to bridge that gap. The framework is demonstrated with a sample of class B and C office building owners in Pittsburgh, a population believed to under-invest in energy efficiency. Interviews (n = 16) and a survey (n = 132) found that while uncertainty and a lack of information about costs and energy savings play a critical role in decision-making, a significant proportion of the respondents also express aversion to debt and a lack of sensitivity to split incentives. Based on the results, providing owners of class B and C offices cost–benefit information and resolving energy savings uncertainty through guarantees, trial periods, or grants that fully subsidize energy efficiency for a small part of a building may be a way to enhance investment. The approach can be applied to other energy efficiency decision-making contexts by anyone with training in behavioral research.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3

The results showed that aggressive driving significantly impacts energy consumption and emissions, with energy consumption increasing by more than ∼200% and emissions by 330% for aggressive driving compared to non-aggressive driving (in MJ/km and in g/km, respectively). This increment was found to be even higher for diesel vehicles than for gasoline vehicles. On the contrary, gasoline vehicles showed higher percentages of increase for most emissions (CO, NOx and NO). Results also revealed that aggressive driving impacts are higher for local streets when examining the city level. Moreover, the economic analysis showed that significant cost reductions may be achieved by avoiding aggressive driving, reaching up to 52.5 k€ on a daily basis. In conclusion, this study is of particular relevance to policy makers and urban planners, enabling to obtain a comprehensive overview of the impacts of aggressive driving behaviors at a city level and providing new insights to perform further developments and to assess the feasibility of the implementation of policy measures.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"Social housing residents are vulnerable to rising energy costs. Reductions in energy use through behaviour change may be part of the solution but require an insight into the factors that relate to energy saving behaviour in this context. This paper responds to recent calls for an integrated approach to studying energy saving behaviours, investigating psychological (i.e. attitudes; perceived behavioural control; subjective norms), contextual (i.e. dwelling energy efficiency; problems with condensation, damp and mould), and socio-demographic factors (i.e. gender; age) together. Data was collected using a cross-sectional survey among social housing residents in South-West England. Dwelling characteristics were not found to add to explaining heating related and other energy saving behaviours beyond well-known psychological and socio-demographic factors. The results did suggest that the presence of condensation, damp and mould was associated with more frequent heating-related energy saving behaviours, but not other energy saving behaviours. Furthermore, a moderation effect was found whereby subjective norms appeared to relate more strongly to heating-related energy saving behaviours when people live in energy efficient homes. The study illustrates the value of an integrated approach in understanding the complex interactions between contextual factors, psychological factors and energy saving behaviour and offers opportunities for future research.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"Improving the energy efficiency levels of the housing stock is of particular concern in the private rental market where capital costs and utility cost savings are not shared in equal measure by landlords and tenants. This problem is particularly pronounced in the German housing market with its predominance of rented accommodation over owner occupancy. The present study is the largest to date to investigate the effect of energy efficiency ratings on rental values. Using a semiparametric hedonic model and an empirical sample of nearly 760 thousand observations across 403 local markets in Germany with full hedonic characteristics, we find evidence that energy-efficient rental units are rented at a premium. However, this effect is not confirmed for the largest metropolitan housing markets. In a second step, a survival hazard model is estimated to study the impact of the energy ratings on time-on-market. It is found that energy inefficient dwelling have longer marketing periods and are hence less liquid than their more energy efficient counterparts.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"Significant research efforts are directed toward measuring and understanding drivers of energy conservation actions of building occupants at home and work. However, there is a lack of studies that explore potential links or patterns in behaviors between the environments, despite a growing trend in the literature to expand the scope of research on the topic from individual to groups of buildings (e.g., community or city scale). This paper presents a unique empirical study of energy conservation actions of building occupants at home and work, exploring key links and patterns in these behaviors. The proposed approach is illustrated and validated through a case study using a dataset of energy saving motivation and action levels of building users in a university campus in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Various data analysis methods are applied including polychoric correlations and ordinal logistic regression. Results confirm a high level of dependency in the patterns observed in the two studied environments with “spillover” effects, where an action taken by an occupant at home more than doubles the likelihood of the same action being taken at work, and vice versa. In parallel, more energy conservation actions are in general observed at home than at work. This can in part be attributed to the limited control of occupants over building systems at work, such as lighting and air conditioning, in addition to the absence of direct financial motives to conserve energy.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"Despite economic, social and environmental benefits, the uptake of energy-saving compact fluorescent lamp light bulbs (CFLs) in Kibera, an informal settlement in Nairobi, remains low. We conducted a randomized controlled field experiment involving 651 Kibera residents assessing whether the joint impact of monetary incentives and behavioral interventions (pre-commitment and simplified information highlighting CFL benefits) could increase CFL uptake. A monetary incentive covering the incremental cost of a CFL compared to an incandescent bulb positively impacted uptake. However, adding simplified information more than tripled the impact of the monetary incentive alone, resulting in a remarkable uptake rate of about 84%. While a post endline survey conducted two years following the administration of the randomized control trial does not find lasting effects, this paper provides evidence for additional behavioral hypotheses in developing countries, also assessing the contribution of intelligence and measured discount rates to account for potential household present bias. It is to date the only intervention of its type that explores the extent to which behavioral interventions can complement monetary incentives.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"Most recent research on energy policy is interested in how policy mixes —the combination of instruments to attend a policy problem— can explain policy outcomes. This policy design framework is utilized here to explain and avoid possible implementation gaps in oil-rich countries engaged in the low-carbon energy transition. Ecuador is used as an typical case for a ten-year policy which headed at a post-oil era after three decades of oil dependence but failed eventually. A causal mechanism linking the adoption of policy aims with the implementation gap is tested against a typology of expected empirical observations based on policy instruments. The main findings indicate how the adoption of contradictory policy aims produces institutional change by layering, which helps actors resisting the policy change to influence the incumbent, eventually undermining the political interplays and the policy outcome.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"This article analyzes ‘rules of the game’ that influence decision-making concerning the introduction of smart energy systems. Smart energy systems are considered as a solution to optimize and make energy systems ‘future-proof’. Their introduction, however, is challenged by a complex multi-stakeholder configuration, and by ‘rules of the game’ (institutional conditions) which are essential for the cooperation between stakeholders but perceived to be outdated. To address this issue, the central research question in this article is: ‘which institutional conditions enable or disable decision-making processes regarding the introduction of smart energy systems in selected city district development projects?’ We conducted in-depth interviews and collected secondary data for four case studies in the Netherlands. Data were analysed, and cases were compared using the Institutional Analysis and Development framework, and the method of causal process tracing. The results reveal that only stakeholders in the position of project leader were actively pursuing the projects’ goals (position rules), legal barriers as well as path dependency of previous decisions limited the available choices (choice rules), and agreement was lacking on sharing costs and benefits (aggregation rules). As ‘rules of the game’ for decision-making continue to present a challenge for the introduction of smart energy systems, future research and policy-making should pay attention to the creation and adequate orchestration of such rules.",Volume 47,January 2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/47/suppl/C,3
"Aside dedicated generation, transmission and distribution networks, the hype around corporations and other entities purchasing so called clean energy may be considered a deliberate accounting misrepresentation. To illustrate this case in this short perspective, we begin by explaining the technical difficulties of remaining “renewables pure”. We then give case studies of two organisations – Apple Inc. and Google LLC – who are, arguably, at fault of making such claims. The method is a simple, non-systematic comparison between what is technically possible, and what is claimed to be possible. Given that incongruous renewables claims have the potential to further impoverish vulnerable households who must bear the financial costs of renewables integration, we conclude that a successful decarbonisation pathway must not have selective winners or losers.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"I propose that vouchers offer a promising approach to making distributed power generation, such as solar home systems, affordable to consumers and profitable for producers and distributors. In a voucher-based system, governments give vouchers to eligible beneficiaries, who then use the vouchers to purchase qualifying products and services. This system enables consumer choice, helps the poor with the affordability of distributed energy products, and injects money into the market for relevant products and services. I discuss practical implementation challenges and argue that digitalization allows governments to significantly reduce corruption and red tape, making vouchers a realistic energy access policy for many governments all over the world.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"The American states are prolific energy policymakers. Over the past two decades, they have adopted a variety of policies aimed at technology innovation and carbon reductions. These policy decisions, however, are not made within a vacuum. States share peer relationships through which they exchange policy relevant information. Research on energy policy has recognized the existence of these networks, but measured them only indirectly, typically with a measure of geographic proximity. This approach likely provides an incomplete picture of the ways in which states share information in this important domain. Based on a pilot survey of expert informants in state energy policy, in this Perspectives article we show that policy information networks extend beyond geographic proximity. Our results reveal that measures used in studies of energy policy diffusion are overly simplistic, underestimate the importance of states sharing information, and fail to capture the actual reasons states look to one another. We argue that it is important to account for these alternative channels in future policy diffusion scholarship.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Recently the field of social acceptance research on energy was mapped by Gaede and Rowlands [1]. Some of their observations are worrying and need reflection. Two essential pivot points have not been recognized, and observed trends in current research practice that must be assessed as highly undesirable are associated with these unnoticed issues.•Missing in the analysis is the start of social acceptance research in the 1980-ies, when the focus was mainly on acceptance by the public. The conceptualization in three process dimensions, each with different actors and objects of acceptance, reveals that public acceptance can never be a valid proxy for social acceptance. Many researchers continue to maintain this harmful conceptual confusion, and Gaede and Rowland’s narrative conclusions seem to suggest we are dealing with a heavy relapse towards public instead of social acceptance.•The crucial turn in 2000 concerning the object of social acceptance, towards institutional change is also missing. Hence, this recognition of institutions as the core object of acceptance research remains underexposed.As the interpretation and labelling of most research fronts by Gaede and Rowlands is questionable, an alternative interpretation is paramount. This is done based on a conceptual elaboration, in which social acceptance is recognized as a bundle of dynamic processes instead of a set of actors positions. The object is ‘energy innovation’, which is also a process. Social acceptance research aims at understanding the transforming social-technological systems, and studies the complex, multi-level and polycentric processes of escaping our institutionally locked-in energy systems.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the role of the social sciences in influencing energy and environmental policy. It presents the views of research professionals inside government on the apparent stand-off between proponents of behavioural economics and adopters of social practice theory in academic energy research.Drawing on auto-ethnographic insights and interviews with government social researchers (GSRs) working on energy and climate change, we chart the rise of behavioural economics within the UK government, discussing the reasons behind its success, and its limitations. GSRs’ perspectives on energy research using practice theory are presented, juxtaposed with arguments which help to explain why policy engagement is not a ubiquitous ambition for all energy researchers.We find that government social researchers actively engage with a range of theoretical approaches and social scientific methods. They express enthusiastic interest in research using practice theory, but point to a need for applicable evidence if they are to use it in their own practice. Applying insights from the two theories themselves, we tentatively suggest ways in which GSRs could help, and be helped, to incorporate practice theory into mainstream policy discourse.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Solid fuels are the primary cooking fuels in a wide range of developing countries, a situation that is projected to remain for the coming few decades. In the energy poverty scholarship, it is a well-argued concept that social systems influence people’s energy choices. Influenced by theories of Practice, this study explores the role that social structure plays in the perpetuation of the use of solid cooking fuels, with a particular focus on rural India. We employ a qualitative approach of inquiry for data collection in three villages in Chittoor district in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The results presented in this paper are based on in-depth household interviews and focus group discussions. The findings suggest that cooking with solid fuels is intertwined with structural elements, such as established traditions, traditional income generating practices, gender norms, and a sense of belonging. These factors profoundly dominate households’ decisions to continue using solid fuels despite the availability and the adoption of modern alternatives. The paper argues that interventions targeted at reducing the use of solid fuels may fail if they: 1) focus only on supplying modern fuels; 2) do not consider contextual social barriers; and 3) are implemented as standalone projects.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Wind farms are constructed in mountainous rural villages where indigenous elderly people believe in Korean traditional beliefs such as pungsu (fengshui or geomancy) thought and shamanism. Built upon mixed qualitative methods, this research examines the relationship between traditional beliefs and local opposition to wind farms. First, the interpretation of mountains and wind based on pungsu clashes with favorable discourses on wind turbines. From the pungsu viewpoint, the wind turbine is considered similar to the iron stakes driven into renowned Korean mountains by Japanese imperialists to block the national spirit of Korea during the Japanese colonial era. A straight, strong wind with high-energy efficiency for wind power generation is considered inauspicious in terms of pungsu. Second, pungsu in local opposition to wind farms is prominent in clan communities in mountainous inland areas with a high proportion of elderly people. Third, senses are associated with shamanism in shaping the elderly’s perception of wind turbines. The noise and lights of wind turbines is a reminder of past memories related to ghosts or dokkaebi (a Korean goblin). Thus, pungsu and Korean shamanism present a unique story that is absent in Western debates on wind farms.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4

"Strategic planning for the low carbon energy transition is characterised by a high degree of uncertainty across many knowledge domains and by the high stakes involved in making decisions. Energy models can be used to assist decision makers in making robust choices that reflect the concerns of many interested stakeholders. Quantitative model insights alone, however, are insufficient as some dimensions of uncertainty can only be assessed via qualitative approaches. This includes the strength of the knowledge base underlying the models, and the biases and value-ladenness brought into the process based on the modelling choices made by users. To address this deficit in current modelling approaches in the UK context, we use the NUSAP (Numeral Unit Spread Assessment Pedigree) approach to qualify uncertainty in the energy system model, ESME. We find that a range of critical model assumptions that are highly influential on quantitative model results have weaknesses, or low pedigree scores, in aspects of the knowledge base that underpins them, and are subject to potential value-ladenness. In the case of the UK, this includes assumptions around CCS deployment and bioenergy resources, both of which are highly influential in driving model outcomes. These insights are not only crucial for improving the use of models in policy-making and providing a more comprehensive understanding of uncertainty in models, but also help to contextualise quantitative results, and identify priority future research areas for improving the knowledge base used in modelling. The NUSAP approach also promotes engagement across a broader set of stakeholders in the analytical process, and opens model assumptions up to closer scrutiny, thereby contributing to transparency.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Conceptual frameworks regarding the spread of new ideas and products through a relevant social group posit communication is necessary between those few group members who are first to act upon the new idea or product and the many more potential later actors. In the case of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), achieving potential social goals regarding human health, climate, air quality and energy requires many more households become PEV owners and users than have so far. Workshops were convened with PEV owners and owners of internal combustion engine and hybrid vehicles (collectively, non-PEVs) in three regions throughout California representing different levels of PEV sales and charging infrastructure deployment. Participants guided the creation of their workshop’s agenda: non-PEV owners stated their questions about PEVs; PEV owners added more they wanted to tell about PEVs and about themselves becoming and being PEV owners. In the subsequent conversations, PEV owners constructed “accounts”—both in the sense of (informally) tallying the costs of buying a PEV and in the sense of telling a story of their lives with PEVs. Their storytelling conveyed the signs of PEVs: how PEVs, charging infrastructure, and incentives are (to PEV owners) an obvious suite of symbols and what those symbols mean (to PEV owners). In effect, the PEV owners teach the owners of non-PEVs a new symbol system and in doing so enhance the non-PEV owners’ ability to see, hear, and interpret the signs of PEVs. Routinely, but not universally, among the non-PEV owners learning the symbol system of PEVs produces more positive evaluations of PEVs.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a promising yet controversial climate change mitigation technology. While numerous studies have addressed perceptions of CCS in fossil energy applications, less attention has been paid to how other applications of the technology may be viewed by lay groups. This article reports on findings from a twoday deliberative focus group held near Drax power station; a coal-biomass co-firing power plant in the north of England. In so doing we adopt a broad, psycho-socially inspired conception of perceived naturalness in order to explore how perceptions of CCS in biomass, fossil fuel, and industrial applications are formed in the context of a range of potential technologies for supporting low carbon energy system transitions. In particular, we explore how perceptions of naturalness and interdependency shaped perceptions of different CCS applications. Our analysis illustrates how perceptions of CCS as threatening, uncanny disruptions to natural systems may shift when re-contextualised to include concerns relating to the intermittency of renewable energy, or be ameliorated through perceptions of industrial and bioenergy applications as supporting natural and economic interdependencies.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professionals can play an influential role in guiding other people’s views of nuclear energy. There has been limited recent research to understand STEM professionals’ attitudes towards nuclear and how they might vary. The present study measured these groups’ attitudes towards nuclear energy as well as their perceptions regarding known determinants of attitudes – including trust in nuclear agencies, appraisals of risk and benefits of nuclear energy, and associated environmental values. Strict criteria were used to identify nuclear experts and STEM professionals. To drill deeper on the determinants of professionals’ perceptions of nuclear energy, this study also investigated the determinants of attitudes towards nuclear energy, when age, gender and professional status were held constant.The STEM professionals perceived nuclear energy to have more negative consequences than did nuclear experts, but less than non-STEM professionals. Levels of trust in the nuclear industry did not significantly differ between the STEM professional and nuclear expert groups, nor did perceived benefits or environmental impacts of nuclear energy. Gender, trust, perceived risk and benefits and environmental values contributed to acceptance of nuclear energy. The most influential of these were trust in the nuclear industry and perceived benefits of nuclear energy.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"We investigate how framing affect consumers’ willingness to buy green electricity using a contingent valuation method. A sample of 1022 respondents was divided into two nearly equal sized sub-samples chosen from an Internet panel. One subsample received a positively framed version of the questionnaire regarding signing up to a green electricity contract, and the other subsample received a negatively framed version of the questionnaire. As expected, consumers displayed stronger intention to buy green electricity when the situation was framed in a positive manner (i.e., most Danish households have already bought it), as compared to the situation framed in a negative manner (i.e., only a few Danish households have bought green electricity). The theoretical explanation can be formulated in terms of the theory of social norms. The framing effect also signals the public good side of green electricity in that there seems to be a free rider problem. The relatively low intention to buy green electricity in the negatively framed question indicates that the free-rider incentive is particularly powerful in large groups, where an individual may perceive that her or his behavior will have only little influence on the collective outcome. The managerial implications are also discussed.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"In consideration of forthcoming amendments to laws and regulations about Japan’s energy systems, we conducted a socio-technical analysis to support discussions towards a consensus on socially acceptable and technologically feasible energy systems for Japan. Using a choice experiment survey, we analysed consumer preferences about the electricity supply in the Tokyo area. We found that consumers tend to purchase electricity from major providers with a renewable-energy component in the mix, which offers stable supply on cheap plans with little price volatility. Furthermore, they avoid nuclear power, and show a positive “willingness to pay” for regional power providers only after possible regional economic benefits are suggested. In our subsequent technical analysis, consumers’ estimated willingness-to-pay for the preferred nuclear-free and renewable energy options were compared with simulated electricity price changes in response to the roll-out of feasible energy systems technologies under different policy scenarios, using computational energy flow models. We found that simulated price increases from an immediate shutdown of nuclear plants and from feed-in tariffs for renewables would exceed consumers’ willingness-to-pay. Our approach of using survey- and simulation-based analyses jointly to facilitate informed discussions on energy system choices should lead to continuous improvements in public and policy discussions towards a consensus.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"The adoption of decentralized renewable energy technologies (RTech) is a challenge in rural sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) despite their potential to increase the living standards of people in these areas. RTech such as solar photovoltaics, biogas digesters and improved cook stoves are disseminated in SSA to supply affordable energy, reduce indoor air pollution, combat deforestation and climate change. Despite extensive research and development in facilitating dissemination over the past five decades, significant challenges still hamper the adoption and sustainability of RTech. This paper reviews current literature on RTech adoption in SSA from a socio-technical perspective to examine the relationship between RTech and users. Three attributes of innovation (i.e., relative advantage, compatibility and complexity) are used to examine user behavior during RTech adoption. In this study, we examine whether and how the attributes of innovation generate disruptions in adopters’ daily lives and how these changes influence the adoption decision process. This is particularly important in rural SSA because it reveals the appropriateness of RTech from different and sometimes interrelated perspectives. The study found that RTech adoption is likely to be high when benefits (i.e., lighting, short cooking times and income savings) are immediate and easily understood. However, RTech compatibility changes with adopter socio-economic status, especially when benefits such as lighting are highly valued. With more than half of the studies reviewed investigating only one innovation attribute, this paper makes a significant contribution to the literature by adopting a multi-dimensional analytical approach.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Energy storage (ES) is a keystone technology for advancing low-carbon energy transitions, yet energy system change continues to be influenced by socio-political acceptance of emerging innovations such as storage. An initial Canadian contribution to the social-scientific study of ES, we conduct a comparative media analysis of news coverage on storage technologies in the provinces of Alberta and Ontario. Applying the Socio-Political Evaluation of Energy Deployment (SPEED) framework, we analyse representations of ES risks and benefits in 143 articles drawn from top-circulating Canadian newspapers between 2007–2017. We then evaluate frame and narrative trends describing ES in these provinces. In doing so, we identify: (1) a generally optimistic national perspective on ES, despite regional variance in risk and benefit framing; (2) greater attention paid to high-profile, smaller-scale ES technologies; (3) a prominence of sustainability and transition narratives around ES; and (4) a positive temporal shift in ES discourse, reflecting changing regional energy priorities and Canada’s increasing commitment to clean energy development. Our findings provide insight on interprovincial differences in social perception on ES and identify possible drivers for these variations to help inform future ES research, deployment and policy strategies in Canada and other evolving national energy markets.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"The burgeoning smart home market brings opportunities for home energy management systems (HEMS). Despite hundreds of smart HEM products on the market and many invested stakeholders, consumer adoption is lagging behind expectations. Past research in this space has focused on smart home technology (SHT) in general, rather than particular products with HEM potential. Conflating smart HEMS with all SHT is problematic because there is a wide range of smart home products and functions, toward which consumers may have varying attitudes. Past work has also rarely distinguished between various stages of the adoption process that lead up to smart HEMS purchase (Knowledge, Persuasion, and Decision Stages). This research used a Diffusion of Innovations framework and survey data from 709 California utility customers to assess the current market and barriers to HEM smart hardware adoption. Cluster analysis based on consumer awareness, interest, and ownership of HEMS revealed four consumer segments at different positions along the path to adoption: Unfamiliar, Unpersuaded, Persuaded, and Owners.

"Despite growing availability of renewable energy or “green pricing” programs for residential use, consumer adoption in the U.S is limited. Existing data indicate that consumer values and political orientation—both of which reflect moral considerations—are associated with interest in renewable energy policies and use. An online experiment (n = 317) tested whether promotional messages framing renewable energy as consistent with participants’ primary moral concerns, as delineated by moral foundations theory, would indirectly lead to more positive message evaluation and greater willingness to pay for such programs. Specifically, the interactions of framing effects with participants’ political orientation were examined, as were the mediating roles of message-induced hope and personal moral norms. Results indicated political orientation was the most consistent predictor of message-induced hope, personal moral norms, and willingness to pay. Message framing did not interact with political orientation to influence mediating or outcome variables. Main effects of framing on hope were identified.

"‘Dynamic’ tariffs aim to help energy users to shift their energy-related practices, and rewards them financially when they modify when and how to use electricity in response to price fluctuations. However, its irregular and unpredictable nature makes it difficult for users to change their routine practices. The ways people interact with energy systems are complex; it involves negotiating and compromising various practices. This paper draws on 37 semi-structured interviews with householders who participated in the UK’s first trial of a dynamic time-of-use tariff (dTOD) for electricity. It explores trial participants’ experience with variable energy pricing. Findings from the interviews show that trial participants were willing to adapt their household practices to price changes as long as the tariff did not ruin their quality of life. Moreover, the trial was a real opportunity for people to respond to price changes. Having experienced it, participants gained confidence in performing their household practices flexibly and felt more control over energy consumption. This UK-based study has relevance to the EU context because smart grids and dynamic pricing is one of the prioritised areas in its energy infrastructure policy.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"This article found that personal history, formed by the accumulated experience of practitioners, affected the present level of energy consumption for space heating and hot water. Moreover, the paper demonstrates how quantitative analyses may provide new insights into studies of energy consumption practices.By following a cohort in two periods of their life; childhood (ages 10–15 in 1981) and early adulthood (ages 29–34 in 2000), I investigated how embodied experience affects how the cohorts consume energy today (2010–2015). Personal history is measured by household characteristics (household income and education level of the household), and house characteristics (house construction year and main heating source).The results indicated that growing up in a household with more economic means correlated with higher energy consumption today regardless of the present economic situation. Moreover, the results indicated that having lived in recently built houses or houses with district heating, compared with for example a stove or a heater, leads to a tendency to consume more energy today.The article concludes by arguing that there is a need to turn attention towards social differences in the competences of individual practitioners, which will result in practices differently performed.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Motivating consumers to adjust their electricity demand with a volatile electricity supply is an important aspect of the energy sector’s transition from fossil to renewable energy sources. (Co-)ownership in renewable energy production facilities turned out to be successful in engaging citizens to finance infrastructures and research indicates that it can also induce behavioural changes in energy consumption. Based on the results of a survey comprising of a sample of 2143 completed questionnaires collected through an online survey and analysed with propensity score matching, this paper looks at the relationship of (co-)ownership in renewable energy production facilities and demand side flexibility.Our results show a statistically significant effect of (co-)ownership of renewable energy production facilities on the willingness of citizens to adjust their consumption behaviour to match their electricity demand to production levels. However, this relation is complex: Only when consumer (co-)owners have the choice between self-consumption and sale of the surplus electricity production to the grid, a statistically significant difference is observed. Furthermore, positive effects on flexible consumption were only found for the usage of household appliances.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"A key factor contributing to the non-realization of energy efficiency potentials is the routinized way in which many energy consumption behaviors (ECBs) are performed. To analyze routinized ECBs, we draw on social practice theory and psychological concepts and suggest a framework that considers individual, social, and material factors. Based on our proposed framework and employing multivariate regression analysis, we gain new insights into associated factors of routinized ECBs—particularly for washing and drying clothes and showering. Analyzing data from a survey conducted among Swiss households in 2016 (n = 5015), we find that individual values, practice-specific wants, and materials explain variations in routinized ECB performance. Furthermore, socio-demographic predictors shed light on cultural and status differences associated with routinized ECBs. This paper contributes to understanding associated factors of routinized ECBs by bridging practice theory and psychology-based factors.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Within the areas of distributed, off-grid, and decentralized energy, there is a growing interest in local energy exchanges. A crucial component of an energy exchange is a return provided by an energy-receiver to an energy-giver for the energy provided. The existing energy literature on such returns is primarily limited to monetary returns and lacks a critical discussion on the different types of monetary and non-monetary returns possible and variation in people’ preferences for these. Based on an ethnographic ‘research intervention’ study conducted at two off-grid villages in rural India for 11 months, this article presents a sociocultural understanding of returns. The article presents a classification of returns consisting of three types, i.e., in-cash, in-kind and intangible, and proposes a conceptual model of ‘returns-continuum.’ The article showcases how people’s preference for a type of return varies with the nature of their social relationships with each other and suggests that configuring a return is not merely an economic act but a complex sociocultural process. Finally, the article recommends to energy researchers and practitioners to enable diversity in returns, to acknowledge dynamics of social relations in returns, to interconnect energy economy with the local in-kind economy, and to engage with ethnographic approaches.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"This paper aims to explore the potential of latecomer cities in sustainability transitions from the demand side. The case study investigates the role of users and their social ties in influencing the popularisation of solar water heaters in a latecomer city Dezhou, in contrast to a more developed counterpart, Beijing. The two cities show vast differences in user preferences towards the low-tech environmental innovation, and the stronger social ties in Dezhou facilitate the diffusion through not only frequent social learning and peer pressure, but also enhancing user-producer trust and relation. These findings suggest that latecomer cities could provide less harsh selection environments for disruptive environmental innovations and their comparatively homogenous social ties could be harnessed to empower niche development.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Rebound effects may undermine current energy policy pathways centred on more energy efficient technologies. The present study analyses why household-level rebound occurs after purchasing an electric vehicle or installing building insulation. Direct and indirect rebound behaviour are operationalised as rearrangements of consumption patterns over time, drawing on concepts of mental accounting and compensatory behaviours. Structural equation modelling is applied to cross-sectional survey data on adopters of electric cars (n = 575) and building insulation (n = 1455) in Austria. A complementary longitudinal sample of adopters of electric bicycles (n = 111) validates the findings. Pro-environmental values and, albeit more weakly, personal norms for environmentally conscious consumption counteract rebound behaviour. Social norms for environmentally conscious consumption increase rebound. Values of frugality and modesty show no discernible impact. These drivers apply similarly to all energy efficiency technologies investigated. In the case of building insulation, low-income and energy-poor households are more liable to rebound; moreover, habitual heating practices increase rebound. Policy design could leverage the drivers studied here to combat rebound, for instance by prioritising consumer segments with a lower risk of rebound, or by supporting rebound-averse mindsets in public communication. Future research should conduct longitudinal studies to strengthen causal inferences about changes in consumption patterns over time.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Substantial public engagement in and support for climate action is needed to prevent the worst impacts of climate change from occurring. Efforts to boost such engagement can be collectively referred to as “social mobilization” initiatives, which can take a number of forms, from government-led planning processes to neighbourhood-scale grassroots initiatives. Such programs hold significant promise in their ability to lower perceptual barriers about climate change and increase motivation for action through various forms of engagement, learning and hands-on involvement. However, evaluations of the necessary components for the success of such programs remain scarce. To address this gap, we evaluate eight research projects that focused on developing and/or evaluating novel social mobilization initiatives on energy and climate change mitigation in the province of British Columbia, Canada. We identify the components of successful social mobilization projects and explore transferable lessons to future initiatives or programs designed to engage and mobilize citizens on climate change. Our findings indicate that social mobilization on climate change can be effectively fostered via multiple pathways. However, several barriers and limitations to effective community engagement on climate change are also identified, along with implications for other regions and researchers attempting to scale up societal responses to climate change.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"In recent years the term ‘energy democracy’ has become increasingly popular, especially in the context of aspirations for a low-carbon transition that include wider socio-economic and political transformation. The emergence of ‘energy democracy’ is thus part of a broader trend in research and practice which has sought to foreground the ‘stuff’ of politics. Yet, unlike the more academically developed concepts of energy justice and energy citizenship, energy democracy is a concept that emerged largely from social movements. This has resulted in a body of literature with little connection to established academic debates and theories. The growing popularity of the concept calls for a critical evaluation of the term and how it is used. By reviewing existing energy democracy publications and bringing these in conversations with more theoretical literature, we are seeking to address four issues; the rationale for pursuing energy democracy, the people and stakeholders involved and excluded, the proposed material focus of energy democracy, and the geographical focus of energy democracy. In the subsequent discussion we draw connections between energy democracy, the growing body of social science energy research and political theory, and identify avenues for further research.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Low-carbon transitions in whole systems (in energy, mobility, agro-food) are an important, yet understudied topic in socio-technical transition research. To address this topic, the paper builds on the Multi-Level Perspective, but stretches it to address developments in multiple regimes and multiple niche-innovations. This ‘zooming out’ strategy changes the conceptualisation of transition dynamics from bottom-up disruption (driven by singular niche-innovations) to gradual system reconfiguration, which represents a more distributed, multi-source view of change that includes cumulative incremental regime change, shifts in relative sizes of regimes, regime alignments, component substitution, and symbiotic adoption. To illustrate the reconfiguration approach and empirically explore the topic of whole system change, the paper investigates unfolding trajectories in UK passenger mobility. This analysis, which addresses developments in auto-mobility, train, bus and cycling regimes and five niche-innovations (biofuels, electric vehicles, smart cards, compact cities, home working), aims to assess if and how the mobility system is reconfiguring in low-carbon directions. It also aims to provide an interpretive assessment of the 12.7% decrease in domestic transport-related CO2-emissions between 2007 and 2013. This decrease is attributed to reduced auto-mobility (due to the financial-economic crisis), incremental engine efficiency improvements in new cars, some modal shift from cars to trains, and biofuels. Radical niche-innovations (smart cards, compact cities, electric vehicles) did not (yet) greatly contribute to emission reductions. CO2-emissions increased again since 2014, which suggests that further low-carbon transitions require deeper system reconfiguration.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"While the theory and practice of transition management has been articulated and tested in Europe, little work in this vein has been undertaken in illiberal democracies, where state institutions may be captured by commercial interests, clientelism may operate and democratic rights may be constrained. We argue that a combination of insights from transition management and transdisciplinary research offers a basis for developing local strategies by which informal institutions can nurture alternative energy policy visions and prescriptions, in order to exploit policy windows that periodically arise. We articulate a conceptual framework to underpin such strategies, which emphasises the role of academics or other knowledge brokers as policy entrepreneurs, helping to build knowledge and capabilities, create networks of social capital and establish alternative discourse coalitions. While our particular applied interest here is in arenas for the development of low carbon energy scenarios in Latin America, the framework is also intended to have wider applicability.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Oil and gas producers have become increasingly reliant on the extraction of marginal and ‘non-conventional’ resources, like deep-sea deposits, bitumen, and shale gas, which are associated with lower economic returns, and higher social and environmental risks. In order to maintain development trajectories amidst a growing chorus of concerned citizens, state and industry advocates of fossil fuel development must not only manufacture consent, they must silence dissent. While there are a number of means to do so at the disposal of state and corporate development advocates, one particularly effective strategy is through enacting restrictions on democratic rights through legislation. The effectiveness of such efforts, however, requires subtle shifts in policy that often escape notice until the ink is dry, and the consequences emerge incrementally, case by case. We term this tactic legislative slippage, analogous to the bureaucratic slippage documented by Freudenburg and Gramling (1992) [1]. We provide a case study of legislative slippage in Alberta, Canada, exhibited in two legislative acts passed in recent years. The legislative slippage observed has direct implications for the rights of citizens to express concerns about energy development, constraining a key process through which states are compelled to take measures to protect the environment.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"A key issue in smart grid visions is the integration of the energy and mobility systems. Electric vehicles (EVs) can be charged with renewable photovoltaic (PV) solar power, and contribute to the integration of solar power in the electricity network via vehicle-to-grid systems. In such systems the role of consumers becomes crucial as they both generate and store energy. We investigate differences between PV and EV adopter groups and the implications of these differences for the transition to smart energy systems. We study how socio-demographic characteristics of the consumer base influence regional diffusion patterns. In turn, we build scenarios to explore the influence of diffusion patterns on the viability of regional EV-PV integration in terms of energy use and regional self-consumption. The results point out large differences in the spatial diffusion patterns between EV and PV. These differences have implications for the transition to smart sustainable grids; vehicle-to-grid systems may not be viable for certain regions.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Scenario-building assists commissioning organisations to understand the multiple forces that shape their future. Governments and investors use the scenario projections of authoritative organisations to help drive their planning and decision-making. But what if scenarios consistently fail to represent a credibly established technology trajectory, particularly for a topic as critical as the world's future energy systems? We examine solar PV projections in 26 recent global energy scenarios, contrasting them with academic studies and other analyses, and find that they all fail to account fully for technology developments and recognise plausible upper levels of solar PV growth. Drilling deeper into the influential World Energy Outlook scenarios of the International Energy Agency, which are amongst the more conservative of the 26 scenarios, we explore possible reasons for, and the implications of, their projections for solar PV growth. We conclude that low scenario projections such as the IEA's are likely to deter investments in innovation and development that would otherwise occur. If authoritative scenarios fully acknowledge the possibility of continuing rapid growth of solar PV, investors, governments and the energy sector will be encouraged to take a more optimistic view of the market potential, thus creating positive feedback loops of belief, investment, and growth.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Building on recent dialogue between sustainability transition theories and Science and Technology Studies (STS), this article conceptually and empirically studies and analyses the orchestration of households as collectives of participation in the process of distributed energy transition. Synthesising across past studies, we explore three types of what we call ‘collectives of orchestration’, relatively durable collectives that work to orchestrate participation at a distance in space and time. These are: a) collectives of policy production and regulation, b) collectives of research, development and innovation, and c) collectives of technology design. We explore how these collectives enroll households, and the ways in which they mediate participation through different strategies and techniques, producing conditions for various modes of participation. We proceed to discuss the co-production of participation in and by households, including ways in which households can re-configure issues around which research and demonstration projects are set up. Through this exercise, we identify four distinct processes through which orchestration is enacted: 1) the production of visions, expectations and imaginations, 2) network construction and re-configuration, 3) scripting and 4) domestication.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4
"Community owned micro-hydropower (MHP) is a cost-effective technology that harvests the potential energy of rivers and generates electricity that can meet the demands of isolated communities in developing countries. The feasibility of MHP schemes depends on physical, social, environmental and economic factors. Remote communities, however, cannot carry out independent pre-feasibility assessments due to lack of know-how. Local developers often identify potential sites by personal references, and perform pre-feasibility assessments by sending engineers to record essential physical variables such as the head or the river flow. No holistic and easy to use MHP pre-feasibility assessment method exists. To facilitate pre-feasibility site identification, we developed a MHP pre-feasibility assessment tool that can be used by developers as well as communities. The tool was validated using data on scheme current success scores (SCSS) gathered from interviews to users and developers of 35 communities with MHP schemes from Nepal, Bolivia, Cambodia and the Philippines. The analytic hierarchy process was used for multi-criteria decision making to incorporate 15 key quantitative and qualitative criteria that affect the likelihood of success of community owned MHP schemes. Results show a strong correlation (0.87) between the tool results and the SCSS. The tool gives equal importance to the physical, social and economic factors, which are significantly more important than the environmental factor. Water availability, terrain quality, community cohesion and financial support are identified as the most important criteria affecting the likelihood of success of schemes. The tool can be easily used and manipulated by developers and communities to generate pre-feasibility assessments.",Volume 46,December 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/46/suppl/C,4

The themes and results are debated in terms of cross-cuttingproblems and possibilities for future investigation into how to socialise climate into energy (and vice versa).","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"A series of weaknesses in creativity, research design, and quality of writing continue to handicap energy social science. Many studies ask uninteresting research questions, make only marginal contributions, and lack innovative methods or application to theory. Many studies also have no explicit research design, lack rigor, or suffer from mangled structure and poor quality of writing. To help remedy these shortcomings, this Review offers suggestions for how to construct research questions; thoughtfully engage with concepts; state objectives; and appropriately select research methods. Then, the Review offers suggestions for enhancing theoretical, methodological, and empirical novelty. In terms of rigor, codes of practice are presented across seven method categories: experiments, literature reviews, data collection, data analysis, quantitative energy modeling, qualitative analysis, and case studies. We also recommend that researchers beware of hierarchies of evidence utilized in some disciplines, and that researchers place more emphasis on balance and appropriateness in research design. In terms of style, we offer tips regarding macro and microstructure and analysis, as well as coherent writing. Our hope is that this Review will inspire more interesting, robust, multi-method, comparative, interdisciplinary and impactful research that will accelerate the contribution that energy social science can make to both theory and practice.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"This article introduces situational analysis a recently developed method in qualitative empirical research, which enables researchers to investigate complexity, multiplicity and mess in the social study of energy. Complexity is understood in its relation to processes of simplification, that occur in the research field, but are also produced by the scientists. The decision in favour of a specific method is understood as a political decision, which influences our capacity not only to examine dominant perspectives and processes, but also to explore invisible and silenced elements, actors and positions in energy cultures. The critical question under investigation is how transformation processes of the way we produce, use and distribute energy can be initiated that entail political as well as scientific practices and processes in which diversity, complexity and modes of reflection are inscribed? Based on the example of energy research governance in the European Union, the article explores how situational analysis with its distinct mapping tools supports the researcher to debate and reflect on simplifications, complexity and power relations, while simultaneously critically asses the problems and challenges of the method.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"The Anthropocene thesis invokes the ‘enormous geological power’ of industrialism: driven by hydrocarbon combustion, manifest in planetary heating. Yet political theory has proceeded as if the organisation of geological power were incidental to history. Geological agency, we submit, is precisely what mining industries are organised to achieve, materially and politically. We propose mineral sovereignty as a term of method to analyse geological power in its legible, institutional and intentional forms. We deploy it to excavate an entwined genealogy of state and corporation: one evident in the constitutional (or extra-parliamentary) technologies of sovereignty and property that order the appropriation and distribution of mineral wealth. Through three provocations, we ‘stratify’ the concept of sovereignty: in the ‘royal metals’ of early modern states; in the rise of neoliberalism as a re-privatisation of mineral-energy infrastructures against the claims of social democracy; and in anticipatory extensions of mineral sovereignty to outer space. Mineral sovereignty discloses methodological problems for energy and climate policy. Pre-analytical distinctions between public law and the private power of fossil capital imply a hierarchy and separation that cannot be presumed, but must be achieved. We must ‘leave it in the ground’: this requires the re-assertion of democratic control over the mineral estate.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Unconventional natural gas exploration using hydraulic fracturing has spread rapidly from its “birthplace” in the Barnett Shale to shale plays across the globe, spurring polarized discussions about its environmental and social risks. These debates have engaged many stakeholders, including some individuals with natural and physical science backgrounds. This study presents results from semi-structured, in-depth interviews I conducted with these individuals, which demonstrate how they framed their engagement in these debates. I argue that the process of interacting in politicized debates over hydraulic fracturing impacted how these individuals constructed what it means to provide objective information to the public. In order to demonstrate objectivity, a number of these participants emphasized their role as problem solvers for, rather than opponents of, the oil and gas industry. Also, to provide balance against their critical evaluation of the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, several participants emphasized the (assumed) social benefits of energy exploration. Through exploring the “problems of method” faced by natural and physical scientists engaged in research on controversial energy topics, and their impacts for my own engagement as a qualitative social science researcher, I seek to contribute to our understanding of the challenges scientists face as they engage in energy research.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Randomised controlled trials are strongly advocated to evaluate the effects of intervention programmes on household energy saving behaviours. While randomised controlled trials are the ideal, in many cases, they are not feasible. Notably, many intervention studies rely on voluntary participation of households in the intervention programme, in which case random selection and random assignment are seriously challenged. Moreover, studies employing randomised controlled trials typically do not study the underlying processes causing behaviour change. Yet, the latter is highly important to improve theory and practice. We propose a systematic approach to causal inference based on graphical causal models to study effects of intervention programmes on household energy saving behaviours when randomised controlled trials are not feasible. Using a simple example, we explain why such an approach not only provides a formal tool to accurately establish effects of intervention programmes, but also enables a better understanding of the processes underlying behaviour change.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Social norms have an important role to play in relation to how practices play out, involving shared understandings and expectations around what should or ought to be. Few studies consider emotions from a social practice perspective in relation to energy studies, however. From a socio-anthropological perspective, we set out to uncover how studying emotions methodologically could provide insights into opportunities for reduced or improved energy usage in the home. Based on a three-year research project focused on household energy usage in Western Switzerland (2015–2017), we demonstrate how studying emotions can help to reveal tensions in discourse and practice, which present windows of opportunities for either de-stabilising or re-enforcing existing practices. What we found is that practices compete for people's time, but also for people's emotions: achieving a ""feel good"" disposition can imply engaging in strategies that involve forms of prioritization, justification or negotiation drawing from different registers, such as a quest for convenience and cleanliness, but also for personal health or safety. In the conclusion, we provide insights on how eliciting emotions through collective action and forms of social learning could lead to opportunities for transformative, socially-embedded change - towards both reduced and improved energy usage.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"It is necessary to combine ecological and social assessment of energy supply options in an integrated approach to come to a holistic understanding of acceptable scenarios. The study thus argues the importance of a thorough ecological basis for social acceptance analyses in this context and exemplifies an integrated approach in which scenarios are evaluated from both ecological and social perspectives.To illustrate the methodology, first, spatially explicit scenarios of electricity supply were assessed according to their ecological footprint by deducing ecological values of the respective landscapes from biotope valences. Following, the scenarios and their ecological assessment served as input for an empirical survey to assess attitudes and preference for an electricity mix (shares of wind power, photovoltaics (PV), and biogas), land use for the infrastructure (in the forest/on pastures), as well as specific combinations of electricity mix and land use.It is shown how, by this two-step procedure, socially preferred and ecologically sustainable scenarios (in this case, electricity mix with a high share of PV (on roofs) with the remaining infrastructure on pastures) can be identified and evaluated within one frame of reference. Methodological challenges and policy implications of the approach are discussed.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Significant research attention has been given to understanding the entanglements of culture and climate change in Indigenous communities for global and Australian contexts. Although there is a growing body of knowledge on the threats and vulnerabilities posed by climate change to Indigenous peoples and cultures, there is only modest substantive research on the ways that Australian Aboriginal people in remote, arid-zone communities observe, understand, experience, and act upon the changing climate. This paper emphasises the importance of place-based research methods for understanding local social and cultural processes in a research project which investigated Aboriginal understandings and responses to climate change in the interior, arid Upper Georgina River Basin (UGRB) in North West Queensland, Australia. The study used a multidisciplinary and mixed-method approach, including a modified national climate change survey. Based on this survey methodology, a distinctive geographic and Indigenous focus shaped the study on public risk perceptions, understandings, and responses to climate change. This study recognises the crucial importance of identifying, measuring and documenting important changes and impacts taking place in the human landscape as only this kind of attention will insure that remote regional communities are coping with the environmental stressors and challenges of the Anthropocene.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Problems of methodology often involve informational and interpretative problems that also affect the social lives of the people being studied and analysed. As such, these problems are inherently important in analysis of those social lives. This paper explores how recognising the problems of informational disorder, or ‘(dis)information’, allow us to elucidate the informational dynamics of the Australian Senate Committee Inquiry into Wind Turbines and the contested ways it attributes causality and distributes responsibility about possible illness. The Committee’s reports and testimonies offer an almost overwhelming source of information about struggles over new forms of energy technology and the ways they become enmeshed in disorders of information, interpretation, politics and the relations of psycho-social disruption produced by climate change. The Committee members appear to be relatively active players in the process, aiming at particular outcomes, and ordering and disordering the information under review.

"For an understanding of thecurrent ‘coal conundrum’ and the German Energiewende, we applied a collaborative research method involving, anthropological and journalistic practices in villages in East Germany, where the expansion of open-cut lignite mines is contested. We conducted an in-depth study of the local socio-political effects of changing energy production forms at the coalface of prevailing and transforming energy production sites, with human life-worlds as a focal point. Working interdisciplinary with methods of radio journalism and social anthropology helped to provide insights into how national agendas based on political will, techno-economical parameters, social life-worlds and the factor of time intersect.Despite commonalities between journalism and anthropology, this approach to energy research posed methodological challenges. Our work lead to questions of how to collect and make sense of scientifically sustainable information that would allow us to understand the impact of the Energiewende. It resulted in reflections of the limits of building trust, eliciting quotable statements, dealing with scripted narratives, our own roles as interlocutors, the limits of interdisciplinary work and the impact of these factors on interpreting information in larger contexts of global climate debates and energy policies.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"The Paris Agreement reached at the COP 21 signals the new centrality of carbon sinks, including soils, as a key means of enabling a net zero carbon global balance through the development of ‘negative emission technologies’. This article focuses on the 4 per 1000 Initiative, which the French government launched to foster soil carbon sequestration with an international scope. We present and discuss the multidisciplinary design of our research, the methodological tensions that it entailed and the assets that it eventually represented for a better consideration of soil agency and vulnerability. Drawing on an in-depth qualitative investigation, we discuss soil carbon sequestration promises in light of the broader politics of soil knowledge. We argue that the 4 per 1000 promise may have failed to give adequate attention to soil’s complex agency (e.g. its capacity to both release and sequester carbon and other greenhouse gases) and soil’s vulnerability (e.g. to urbanisation and intensive agriculture, which have long been causing soil degradation, including carbon loss). Committing to a richer conception of soil agency and soil fragility is crucial to enact the social and environmental conditions for fostering efficient and sustainable technological and political change in relation to climate change.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Within energy planning, technical methods and quantitative data are often key components in assessing energy demand and developing feasible scenarios to meet communities’ energy needs. Designing and implementing a transdisciplinary research approach to community energy planning, which attempts to combine conventional energy engineering techniques with in-depth qualitative (conventional social sciences) approaches, can pose challenging methodological questions in theory and practice. The paper discusses the design and development of a transdisciplinary methodological framework for community energy planning. Focussing on an island community in the west of Ireland, the paper then examines the implementation of this framework which generated qualitative data through in-depth focus groups and problem-centred interviews to inform the design of technical energy plan scenarios, employing hybrid micro-grid system design software. The results section outlines some of the rich context and place specific, energy related empirical evidence that was generated and discusses the development of three energy scenarios for the island. Finally, drawing on participants’ observations on the process, the concluding discussion offers a reflection on the possibilities and challenges of employing a transdisciplinary approach to community energy planning with a view to providing valuable insights for energy planners, policy makers and researchers embarking on future research in this space.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5

The complexity of such initiatives – involving regulatory, technological, financial, and governance issues – demands ways to integrate technical expertise, local cultural and environmental characteristics, and other relevant factors into development processes. This article reflects on a transdisciplinary project that investigated how renewable energy could be implemented to meet the needs and aspirations of rural and remote Indonesian communities. We discuss the sustainability science approach taken and how the transdisciplinary methodology was applied. The article addresses themes of language and communication, methods of knowledge production, legitimacy, planning and time management, and the role and impacts of social and technical disciplines in the research. The paper highlights specific challenges in these areas, and appropriate strategies to mitigate them. Our conclusions propose useful principles for this type of transdisciplinary work: preparation, common understandings, flexibility, shared responsibility, respect, and lightheartedness and humour. The manuscript identifies important empirical and methodological future research priorities, and offers insights to inform social research dimensions of applied research methods in the context of complex development initiatives and the multi-scale socio-economic and political systems in which they take place.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Construction must play a major role in meeting climate change targets, but this will require major changes in industry practice. The sector will need to adopt innovative low-carbon technologies, integrate these within novel building designs and ensure these designs are constructed, implemented and optimised successfully. A likely precondition for this is greater levels of integration within the construction supply chain. While there is evidence that supply chain integration (SCI) can improve project performance and enable innovation, the literature rarely differentiates between different types of innovation and has paid little attention to low-carbon innovation. This paper synthesises insights from three different bodies of literature – construction innovation, low carbon buildings and SCI – to create a typology of low-carbon innovations in non-domestic buildings and to identify conditions and strategies for their successful implementation. It proposes that low-carbon innovations are ‘building-enhancing’ ‘integral’ and/or ‘user-dependent’ and their effective implementation requires collaboration, championing and user-involvement. The paper uses two case studies to illustrate the diversity of mechanisms through which these conditions can be realised. It concludes with some reflections on the methodological challenges of studying this topic, together with the wider implications of the proposed framework for industrial practice and public policy.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Over the last decade, unconventional coal seam gas (CSG) reserves in the Australian State of Queensland have been rapidly developed and include controversial extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing ('fracking'). Large-scale CSG projects primarily supply an international liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry. This has integrated regions of CSG extraction into global energy networks and wider societal debates about envisioned energy futures and climate change. In this article, we discuss how ethnographic research that aims to understand CSG or other energy developments holistically prompts ethnographers to rethink their 'field sites' and forces us to pay attention to global interconnections, methods, positionality, ethics, and the politics of representation. We explore these themes by first outlining some of the key developments in anthropology and ethnographic research over the past decades. This outline provides the groundwork for a discussion of the challenges arising during our own multi-sited ethnographic research in Queensland's Western Downs region. Our aim here is to spark debate about the shape of ethnographic energy research. With ethnographic methods increasingly used in social research, this discussion should be of broader interdisciplinary benefit. We conclude by highlighting the need for ethnographic reflexivity and contemplate the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration to address these questions.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"The Blacktip gas project, owned by the multinational corporation Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI) and located near the marginalised, Indigenous-majority town of Wadeye in the Northern Territory of Australia, is the ethnographic setting to explore the connections of energy industry projects in the age of the Anthropocene. At the core of these issues are considerations of how carbon energy industries operate, how these industries are transforming natural and social ecologies, and how the benefits and costs of the sector are circulated. Much of influential research work and government policy tend to frame these considerations within analytical methodologies of “economic development”: despite pockets of public opposition, the presence of energy projects such as Blacktip are largely taken for granted by authorities, and debates are limited to questions around business-state cooperation and wealth generation. As a methodological alternative, I apply Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of the assemblage to analyse the Blacktip project as a complex network that expresses broader social power relations. I suggest the disrupting image of the cyborg – as the colonising, techno-capitalist blend of human and computer, with carbon-based energy as its lifeblood – as a modern-day assemblage that offers a new method for understanding modern energy cycles, in particular how they are structured by contemporary carbon energy industry corporations. I conclude by arguing that if dominant, taken-for-granted discourses around the benefits of projects such as Blacktip are critically challenged by the (albeit limited) analytical device of the cyborg, social and ecological alternatives can be more openly imagined.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"This article presents research designed to deepen understanding of institutional fossil fuel divestment, as one approach to addressing climate change. Since 2011, a growing global social movement has emerged focused on divestment of fossil fuel company holdings and reinvestment of those resources in clean energy. The study used a qualitative research design, employing a positive deviance approach and the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM), a well-established clinical psychology framework, to explore U.S.-based foundation leaders' readiness to pursue divestment. Investors have conventionally relied on fossil fuel holdings as investment portfolio mainstays. Therefore, leaders' divestment behavior constituted positive deviance: intentionally engaging in non-normative behavior intended to contribute to successful outcomes. The study examined leaders' motivations and actions in pursuing divestment, while simultaneously exercising their fiduciary (legal) duty to steward responsibly institutional assets. Research questions focused on the divestment behavior change process. Data collection and analysis were derived from two datasets: 34 foundation divestment commitment statements and semi-structured interviews with 18 foundation leaders. Findings included that leaders engaging in divestment may experience higher levels of satisfaction, pride, happiness, and engagement with organizational roles. Results yielded insights into organizational leadership, climate action, and utility of positive deviance and the TTM as research methods.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Understanding the role of large energy corporations in society is a crucial, yet challenging task for the social science of energy. Ethnographic methods hold potential for plying into corporations’ own self-representations, to reveal the relations of power and politics that determine flows of energy and extractive capital at the global and local level. Ethnography help us move beyond structural analyses, to locate the agents and processes at work within economies of energy production, and identify tensions and dynamics both within the corporation and at the interface with society. We argue that a multi-method and reflexive approach can help social scientists reflect on frictions in corporate encounters, and more importantly that attention to frictions is in fact a gateway to gain new insights about the field. In our research project about Norwegian energy companies and their corporate social responsibility work when ‘going global’, applying a multi-method made us question dominant assumptions within anthropology of what constitutes “access”. We discuss how multiple approaches to “access”, which takes into account the positionality of the researcher, fluidity of research fields along with attention to power dynamics can shape the sort of knowledge that is produced when studying energy companies.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Why do some countries enact more ambitious climate change policies than others? Macro level economic and political structures, such as the economic weight of fossil fuel industries, play an important role in shaping these policies. So do the national science community and the national culture of science. But the process by which such macro-structural factors translate into political power and national climate change policies can be analyzed through focussing on meso level policy networks. The Comparing Climate Change Policy Networks (COMPON) research project has studied climate change policy networks in twenty countries since 2007. Along with some findings, this paper presents some methodological challenges faced and the solutions developed in the course of the project. After a presentation of the project, we first outline some practical challenges related to conducting cross-national network surveys and solutions to overcome them, and present the solutions adopted during the project. We then turn to challenges related to causal explanation of the national policy differences, and propose Qualitative Comparative Analysis as one solution for combining different levels of analysis (macro and meso) and different data types (quantitative, network and qualitative).","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Historically, energy and climate research have failed to fully integrate research from the social sciences. This is problematic as the development of energy systems and the rapid acceleration of climate change are directly tied to human activity. When the social sciences are incorporated in energy and climate research, their scope is frequently economically oriented. Methodological approaches remain frequently quantitative in nature. While important, these approaches cannot fully capture the nuances of power, inequality, and justice within decisionmaking processes that create and constitute our energy systems and subsequent climate change impacts and outcomes. As energy decisions and policies continue to increasingly shape the extent to which the world is impacted by climate change, we must think precisely about the complexity of identity and who is involved in energy decisions; who benefits from, and who is burdened by particular sets of energy decisions and the impacts of climate change. In addition, we must examine how these burdens and benefits manifest differently based on individual and group identities. To ignore these questions creates a research field where social actors and organizations remain decoupled from their role and responsibilities in the construction of and participation in these energy systems; where the embeddedness of a system is taken for granted, remains unscrutinized and unchallenged, and acts as a path-dependent barrier to the envisioning and building of an alternative energy future. In order to strengthen energy and climate change research and policy we must engage in research methods that can better account for underlying issues of power and justice within the decisionmaking processes across multiple socio-political scales. More specifically in this paper, I argue that using qualitative methodological tools rooted in intersectional feminist theory, such as a multi-sited critical policy ehtnography, are a crucial way to do so.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"The authors ran a pair of interventions to encourage passive cooling measures in two sustainable energy communities: E-Sogo in Japan and West Village in the United States. The interventions used proven levers for encouraging behavior change (among adult household members), but yielded modest results. Traditional methods of evaluating intervention effectiveness do not reveal why responses are weak, so the authors examined participants’ experiences using qualitative data collected during the intervention. Three critical flaws were identified; namely, the interventions had targeted a single household member, promoted measures that impact other members, and failed to support coordination within the household. To understand why those shortcomings led to weak results, the study examines the intersection of the social attributes of cooling measures (i.e., locus of decision and impact on others) and the prevailing social dynamics within households. A game-theoretical model is developed to illustrate how the varied combinations of measure attributes and social dynamics can yield different outcomes across households. By examining the failures of commonly accepted social science methods, the study sheds light on the intersection of social dynamics and household energy practices, a line of inquiry which, when extended further, could make energy interventions more effective and socially valid.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Energy transition is often described as the shift from deterritorialised models developed in tandem with the rise of capitalism towards a paradigm based on small-scale infrastructures and short supply chains. In this new paradigm the local dimension is pivotal. This paper takes a self-reflective stance on situated research conducted with local communities in Italy, Indonesia and Australia. The three rural communities are characterised by community ownership of energy production sites (past, current, and future ownership respectively), and by the copresence of alternative visions of energy sustainability among the locals. Drawing on the research experiences the paper reflects on the interrelated methodological, epistemological, and practical challenges encountered. Immersive and participatory approaches enabled the research teams to avoid prescriptive approach to the research, to access local understandings of energy and sustainability, and to gain insights into local interactions between multiple forms of knowledge and power. Across the three cases, methodological and epistemological challenges call for a careful consideration of the role of research and its interaction with power dynamics, capacity of collecting voices and knowledges, and democratization goals. Such challenges are discussed taking into account the ""transferability"" of methods and approaches across space, time and related project specificities.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Reducing residential energy use and related CO2 emissions across society requires approaches that understand energy demand as dependent on the performance of a range of interconnected social practices, which includes aspects of timing, location and material contexts. However, current energy policy and change initiatives often rely on a somewhat narrow combination of rational consumer choice models, efficiency measures and information-based behavioral change theory, thus falling short on anticipated reductions. Insights from the ENERGISE project highlight the merits of a practice-theoretical approach to social scientific energy research that explicitly recognizes complex interactions in the social organization of everyday life. The paper demonstrates how such an approach provides knowledge on variations in energy use across households, social groups and societies and how these are (not) acknowledged in the problem framings of dominant energy policies and change initiatives. Reflecting on experiences made during a large-scale comparative analysis of sustainable energy consumption change initiatives in 30 European countries, this paper presents a new and innovative methodology for investigating the dynamics of change initiatives that target energy use within households and communities. It concludes with some critical reflections on the methodology presented.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Understanding the complex dynamics that influence energy transitions requires mixed methods and collaborations among researchers, resource managers, and communities. This essay details how an interdisciplinary team of researchers used a mixed-method approach to study the social dimensions of tourism and recreation as they relate to the first offshore wind farm in the United States, the Block Island Wind Farm. Although impacts to tourism from wind energy systems are widely cited as a concern by communities and policymakers, little work has sought to define what constitutes tourism and recreation impacts or provided empirical evidence of impacts from operating projects. Researchers adopted an iterative approach to research that combined discrete studies using media content analysis, ethnographic participant observation, and stakeholder focus groups, to understand the social effects of the wind farm on the tourism and recreation experience and the quality of life in Block Island and coastal Rhode Island. We detail key insights from our experimentation with an iterative mixed-method approach at Block Island and offer lessons for future studies using collaborative approaches to understand both the tangible and the intangible social dynamics of energy system transitions.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Debates on climate change, energy and food security concerns have underscored the need for new methods and tools to explore and understand the complexity of these relevant issues. In this study, we used unsupervised probabilistic modeling—latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)—to examine the changes in social policy debates related to ethanol production in Brazil and its relationship with climate change and food security. We analyze a large amount of data obtained from Brazilian newspapers, government and business documents, and the bulletins of nongovernmental organizations and social movements from 2007 through 2017. The results from the LDA application allowed us to identify key topics, detect novel trends, and follow them through time, in addition to exhibiting the limitations encountered in identifying social actor discourses. To overcome these limitations, we combine LDA and discourse analysis to enable the construction of topics, concepts, and discourses of the actors surrounding the issue of this study. The findings verify the utility of these techniques by emphasizing the themes and discourses of the actors involved and by identifying the determinant positions of the Brazilian actors in the discussions on ethanol production and its competition with food security and the contributions of ethanol as a renewable energy source to mitigate climate change. This finding provides insights for water–energy–food nexus research.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"The study of energy system transitions requires research methods that incorporate multilayered systemic factors that span shifts in time, contexts, and actor groups. To integrate this complexity into energy transition research can be a daunting methodological challenge. However, it can illuminate how an energy system operates and help identify the levers that influence a transition to sustainable energy sources. This article describes how a multistate study of the strategies and policies to promote advanced wood heating technology in the northeastern United States encountered methodological challenges indicative of the broader problems faced in energy system transitions. In particular, we found that changes in macrolevel systemic factors (e.g. price of oil) and the early stage of diffusion of this particular technology complicate sampling and ultimately affect the application of results. While a participatory research approach and use of key informants helped in developing the sampling strategy, survey questions and access to study participants, it also introduced logistical difficulties and the potential for pro-innovation bias. We describe the mixed methods used to capture the systemic factors that affect adoption of this technology and highlight implications for research on interventions that seek to promote alternative energy technologies.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"It is often argued that there is a sharp disjuncture between the abstracted prospect of large-scale climate crisis and direct experience on the ground. Ethnographers investigate experiences, so how are we to research climate crisis? The anticipated crisis is unknowable in its depth and reach; the everyday experience of consumer capitalism confines horizons to infinite accumulation and ‘growth’. Here, ethnography has potential as an interpretative tool to highlight ways in which the crisis and proposed energy transitions are encountered. Various forms of ‘climate ethnography’ explore this nexus between climate science and on-the-ground contexts where climate change is experienced, where policy is being developed or applied, or where institutional and political formations are seeking traction. The article surveys this emerging field, paying particular attention to studies relevant to energy and climate research. It especially reflects on definitions of climate ethnography as ‘ethnography with a mission’, debating the effort to advance normative agendas and develop research insights that can help gain a stronger purchase on the widening crisis.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"This article foregrounds some of the ethical dilemmas and physical and emotional risks involved in the experience of doing ethnographic fieldwork in a contested and violent political environment where one’s academic enterprise might impinge upon the security of one’s respondents. How does one undertake genuine collaboration with local researchers, community members and grassroots organizations in volatile conflict-ridden spaces where respondents are wary of participating in “research” since data from past research activities has led to undesirable impacts on their lives, yet they also want a more accurate representation of their needs, demands and desires? In this situation fieldwork research has to be carefully analysed and organised so that it has the least potential for harm. This may involve voluntarily withdrawing from tense situations, making quick and unscheduled visits, avoiding attention and so on. These solutions create new problems. Drawing from fieldwork conducted over three years, this article discusses how research questions and findings are often limited by personal possibilities and positionalities, and reflects on the ethical dilemmas and emotional challenges of fieldwork and the limitations of research.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"In textbooks on the research methods used in social science, focus groups are presented as a suitable option for efficiently opening up new fields of analysis and understanding group reactions to particular problems. Furthermore, focus groups are seen as a more participatory means of conducting research. Against this background, we discuss the potentials and risks of utilizing focus groups to study the current energy transition in Germany. This paper is based on a critical reflection of the literature on focus groups and on our practical experiences using the method in three different research projects. We address three aspects of using focus groups: first, the specific role of focus groups within the methodological design of our research projects; second, the claim that the method is efficient and participatory; and third, the way focus groups interact with the social context of energy projects. We discovered that focus groups are a tool that not only allow us to form an understanding of complex and contested issues, but that conducting focus groups means producing or reproducing social realities by simultaneously changing social configurations and affecting the power relations in the socio-material arrangements of the energy systems involved.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"We present the methodology and results of a role-play game that explored energy preferences and decision making criteria for a hypothetical town. Six day-long, mixed-methods workshops focussing on public perceptions of shale gas and oil development were held with highly diverse groups in four urban locations (Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, US; London and Cardiff, UK) and two rural locations (Hirwaun and Winford, UK), N = 83. As part of the workshops, small groups of participants assumed the role of town council members and were asked to debate and rank six energy infrastructure proposals (wind, solar, nuclear, shale gas, shale oil, and coal) in order of preference; a task that stimulated energetic, in-depth discussions around preferences, decision-making criteria, conditions and trade-offs. We reflect on how role-play methodology can be used to elicit insights into the nature of complex decision-making, as well as affording participants clarity and efficacy about decisions, and providing a novel platform by which to engage with energy conundrums. We also elucidate the challenges posed by inevitable disparities between role play and reality, and those associated with materials, framings, and group dynamics. Finally, we make recommendations for extending and refining the methodology, including participant-led framing and cautious consensus building.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"Transitioning food, energy and water systems for adaptation and mitigation of climate change is a challenge requiring social as well as technological solutions. The best technological solutions will only be effective if combined with behavior changes placing climate change at the forefront of our socio-cultural consciousness. Education is central in creating such a shift. Climate researchers have an important role in aiding the uptake of climate change education in U.S. public schools, where educators are often untrained and uncomfortable teaching the subject. This paper assesses the efficacy of implementing an interdisciplinary, experiential climate change curriculum in school garden classrooms in terms of student climate literacy and teacher professional development. The questions of how to teach and research climate education are explored via a participatory research project with schools in Oakland, CA and Lopez Island, WA. Initial results show improvement in student learning and engagement as well as teacher preparation. Both qualitative and quantitative data are analyzed through student surveys, teacher interviews, and site observation; however, further qualitative methodologies to study process of climate and energy literacy development are needed. Specifically, this paper argues for new forms of assessment to capture dimensions of climate literacy including knowledge, engagement, and behavior change.","Volume 45, Pages 1-384 (November 2018)",November 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/45/suppl/C,5
"In this perspective article, we undertake a brief empirical analysis of the dominant narratives in debates around India’s energy future. India has ambitious goals for increasing renewable energy and enabling universal energy access, but there is little social consensus on how these goals should be achieved. We find two compelling narratives in energy policy debates in the country: ‘energy for development’ that privileges energy as critical to economic growth and long term strategic security; and ‘energy for all’ that prioritises the role of energy for basic development and ending poverty. We find that while these narratives find common ground on certain issues such as the role of coal, they clash in the socio-technical imaginaries they represent about India’s energy future. Indian energy policy has been characterised so far by top down, centralised policymaking. With this article, we highlight the societal choices that are inherent in discussions about transformations in India’s electricity sector and call for further research on the socio-cultural dimensions of future energy pathways in India.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"It is increasingly recognized that participatory interventions (PIs) are an effective means to enhance organisational members’ energy-saving behaviours. However, the mechanisms behind why PIs successfully raise motivation towards energy-conservation have yet to be examined. To fill this gap, we argue that satisfaction with a PI triggers a positive affect towards energy-savings, and thereby, helps participants to internalize energy-saving motivation. Accordingly, it is proposed that those participants who had low autonomous energy-saving motivations prior to the PI benefit more from a satisfactory intervention than those participants who already felt self-determined to engage in energy-conservation. These hypotheses were tested and supported within the higher educational context. Compared to the control group (N = 77) that received a lecture-based intervention, subjects in the PI condition (N = 142) reported more autonomous motivation to engage in energy-savings after the session. Furthermore, satisfaction with the PI resulted in more autonomous energy-saving motivation and this effect was moderated by the energy-saving motivation prior to the PI. This study underlines the importance that PIs should be led by facilitators who are a) capable of providing satisfactory PIs, and b) address specifically those participants who are not yet autonomously motivated to save energy in non-residential buildings.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"In humanitarian crises, experiences of sexual and gender-based violence, primarily experienced by women and girls, are known to increase and intensify. There are current humanitarian crises across several regions of the world, and as many as 65 million displaced people. As such, there is an ongoing need to consider the role of energy interventions in addressing gendered violence in emergency contexts. Here I argue that although international humanitarian actors may advocate for them, technological energy interventions, including lighting, improved cookstoves and the provision of firewood, cannot prevent or solve the problem of violence against women or girls. By bringing the existing literature on energy interventions into conversation with the emerging literature on causes and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence, I highlight the limitations of a technical, universal intervention to gender-based violence in complex and traumatised social settings, each with their own local dynamics and gendered norms. Moreover, advocacy for such technical solutions makes both the particularity of gender in different sociocultural contexts, and other possible responses, invisible. Indeed, local contexts, and local responses must be considered the starting point for responding to gender-based violence, in which engaging with energy practices is at most one approach to prevent violence by engaging the broader context of trauma, poverty and gender in which it occurs.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"Improved cookstoves are widely promoted as a health and climate improving technology, yet there remains a wide gap between their reputed benefits and the inconclusive outcomes of most interventions. An increasing number of scientists suggest that the popular lab protocols used to test, rate and model the benefits of improved cookstoves are at least partly to blame. Insights from a recent study of improved cookstove users in Darfur, Sudan, reveal the extent to which the logic and goals of lab-based testing protocols differ from actual cooking practices. We elaborate on the climate and energy policy implications of decontextualized lab tests and conclude with a call to design, test and select for dissemination only those improved cookstoves that are rated on the basis of their intended contexts of use.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"Meeting the climate change targets in the Paris Agreement implies a substantial and rapid acceleration of low-carbon transitions. Combining insights from political science, policy analysis and socio-technical transition studies, this paper addresses the politics of deliberate acceleration by taking stock of emerging examples, mobilizing relevant theoretical approaches, and articulating a new research agenda. Going beyond routine appeals for more ‘political will’, it organises ideas and examples under three themes: 1) the role of coalitions in supporting and hindering acceleration; 2) the role of feedbacks, through which policies may shape actor preferences which, in turn, create stronger policies; and 3) the role of broader contexts (political economies, institutions, cultural norms, and technical systems) in creating more (or less) favourable conditions for deliberate acceleration. We discuss the importance of each theme, briefly review previous research and articulate new research questions.

"The energy cultures framework has had widespread use in studies of the energy-related implications of habitual behaviour and behaviour change, and to other topics including mobility, water and carbon-related outcomes. As a heuristic that has become widely used because it helps researchers to make sense of how cultural formations influence sustainability outcomes, it is timely to explore its relationship to cultural theory. I discuss the origins and applications of the framework and elaborate its underpinning concepts about the relationship between cultural formations and sustainability outcomes. I contrast these concepts with cultural theory and conclude that the sustainability cultures approach has similar roots to practice theory, but diverges at several key points. The actor-centred articulation of cultural attributes and their outcomes, with its main focus on actors’ agency in cultural change, contrasts with practice theory’s view of actors as ‘carriers’ of routine practices. It aligns most closely with Bourdieu’s habitus although more substantial theoretical enquiry is needed to explore linkages to Bourdieu’s interest in praxis. Sustainability cultures offers an approach to investigating the significant cultural changes that will be required for a sustainable future.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"Lifestyles can play an important role in shaping consumer behaviour regarding novel low-carbon technologies. In this study, we develop a conceptual framework based on lifestyle theory, which defines lifestyle as engagement in several related practices that inform and convey self-identity. We apply this theory to the case of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) technologies by conducting 17 semi-structured interviews with PEV-owning households in or near Vancouver, Canada. We categorize participants based on their engagement in technology-oriented or pro-environmental lifestyles. We explore participants’ functional, symbolic and societal motivations relating to PEV purchase, driving patterns, public charging usage, and interest in a controlled charging program. Some patterns are consistent across lifestyle segments, where most participants emphasized the practicality of PEVs, the improved driving experience and overall interest in environmental protection. However, motivations varied, some corresponding with participants’ lifestyle engagement; for example, participants that engaged in pro-environmental lifestyles were more likely to emphasize the environmental aspects of PEV usage. Together, these findings suggest that policymakers and researchers ought to consider the variety of motivations that may influence purchase and use of PEV—even among Pioneers—which may relate to a variety of benefits such as cost savings, environmental protection and symbolic value.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"Citizens’ emotional responses to energy technology projects influence the success of the technology’s implementation. Contrary to popular belief, these emotions can have a systematic base. Bringing together insights from appraisal theory and from technology acceptance studies, this study develops and tests hypotheses regarding antecedents of anger, fear, joy, and pride about a local hydrogen fuel station (HFS). A questionnaire study was conducted among 271 citizens living near the first publicly accessible HFS in the Netherlands, around the time of its implementation. The results show that anger is significantly explained by (from stronger to weaker effects) perceived procedural and distributive unfairness, and fear by distributive unfairness, perceived safety, procedural unfairness, gender, and prior awareness. Joy is significantly explained by perceived environmental outcomes and perceived usefulness, and pride by prior awareness, perceived risks, trust in industry, and perceived usefulness. The study concludes that these predictors are understandable practical and moral considerations, which can and should be taken into account when developing and executing a project.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"There are competing visions for what future low-carbon energy systems might look like. However, it is likely that consumers will be more actively involved in managing their energy use. Consequently, there is likely to be some disruption to the current rhythm of everyday domestic social practices. This paper considers what we can learn from people who already take a more active role in managing their energy supply, with the aim of identifying transferable lessons that could be applied to future energy system decentralization. We compare two case studies focused on people with different levels of grid connectivity - people living off-grid on narrowboats and living in semi-grid connected houses in rural Norfolk. We find that where people had constraints on their energy use, they responded in three main ways. First, they diversified their energy supplies, including adopting traditional fuels such as coal and wood. Second, people planned, monitored and shifted their energy use, responding in ways favorable to micro-generation and demand-side response. Third, people curtailed energy use. We propose that UK households may respond in similar ways to decentralized energy. Finally we consider the implications of our findings for future energy policy aimed at decentralizing energy production and supply.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"This paper explores how the extension of the national electricity grid in a village in rural Kenya affects households’ energy using practices. Based on ethnographic research, this paper examines how people act while anticipating electricity as well as what energy practices emerge as part of life with a partial presence of electricity infrastructure.Drawing on anthropological infrastructure studies and STS, the paper suggests members of a community participate in the formation of an electricity infrastructure through their preparatory practices. The making of electricity infrastructures through anticipatory actions has not yet been subject to research, but as the article argues, it is precisely by acquiring competences like stacking of resources or adjusting to breakdowns and volatile electricity prices that energy infrastructures are composed. The paper further argues that certain objects of anticipation allow for making preparations in relation to uncertain electric and political futures.By leveraging the notion of anticipatory infrastructural practices the main contribution of this article is to enrich the understanding of participatory politics to also encompass mundane actions related to energy distribution and use. This is relevant in anticipation of a future where a dramatically higher number of people will become grid connected.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"Socialisation into electricity consumption usually occurs during childhood, but little is known about the socialisation processes involved. Here, we use interviews and focus groups to investigate how nine to ten-year-old children from New Zealand learn about, and consume, electricity in their homes. The children used a wide range of electrical appliances and engaged in different energy saving behaviours, often without being conscious of their implications. Control over appliances and learning through modelling, reminders and rules helped to socialise children into saving electricity, while nagging and inconsistent behaviours from parents were counterproductive. Conversations about energy were uncommon, but helpful for creating consciousness about energy use. We discuss the need for a more structured approach, through developing energy literacy, in order for children to use their agency, surpass their parents’ level of energy saving practices, and stabilise energy saving behaviours through life. In addition, we provide recommendations on how parents, schools, the media and product developers can help in this process.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"According to the European Union Third Energy Market package, the roll-out of smart meters in the residential sector can presumably play a key role in reaching the goals of sustainability strategies. However, the deployment of smart meters alone does not necessarily drive residential customers to use energy in a more sustainable manner. Therefore, more attention should be paid to customers energy behavior in order to reach the objectives of the roll-out policy. In this study, we propose an interdisciplinary framework that establishes a behavioral model to identify the main energy-related behavior change requirements necessary to engage residential customers in energy applications. To fulfill the requirements, we first present the technical system architecture that enables energy applications for residential customers. Then, we assess how gamification, which is the employment of game design elements in non-game contexts, can be used to enhance energy applications by driving customer engagement and energy-related behavior change. To do that, the most relevant game design elements are discussed and classified. After that, the expected value streams from using a gamification-based solution for different stakeholders in the energy market are identified. Finally, the study discusses the potential of the proposed framework in different energy applications for residential customers.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"The theoretical frameworks describing the dynamics of energy demand influence the ways in which policymakers conceive of energy use and consider feasible interventions. Practice theory approaches are widely applied to energy demand studies as an alternative to individual behavior-based ones that tend to aggrandize the explanatory dominance of human agency or structure. However, applications of practice theory that respond to these economic or behavior-based descriptions of energy use are overwhelmingly placed in Western settings. This fieldwork-based ethnographic investigation applies a practice theory approach to a description of common bathing practices in a non-Western context: Japan. This case situates and extends practice theory applications, emphasizing the need to understand the embeddedness of culture in energy use. The findings suggest that (1) breaking down a bathing practice into its elements, (2) exposing its interdependencies with other practices, and (3) examining the ways it reproduces itself and other practices offers a realistic and insightful approach for conceptualizing energy intensive practices. Bathing in Japan is intertwined in many other aspects of life in Japan that must first be taken into account before developing feasible policy on sustainability. This study concludes by highlighting ways in which practice theory informs political interventions on energy use.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"Research on the determinants of direct and indirect energy use has identified a range of relevant socio-economic factors. However, we still know little about possible influences of people's health on their energy use. Do people in poor health use less energy because they are on lower incomes, or do they have additional domestic energy needs as they spend more time at home? Does poor health reduce mobility for all or just some (environmentally-friendly) modes of travel? This paper examines these questions through analysis of the representative UK Understanding Society survey. We find that poor health is generally linked to lower home energy use and lower engagement in all forms of travel. However, once we control for income and other socio-demographic factors, poor health is related to higher electricity consumption. These findings have important policy implications as it means that people in poor health would be additionally burdened by higher cost of electricity but, due to their low mobility, less so by higher cost of energy-intensive forms of travel. While promoting good health could support environmentally-friendly travel, additional measures would be required to prevent a rise of energy-intensive modes of travel.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"The energy literature is rich with information on the targeted effects of a behavioural intervention – numerous studies have examined if/how a particular energy behaviour changes over time. There has, however, been much less research on the untargeted effects of a behavioural intervention – limited studies have examined if/how a particular energy behaviour changes untargeted behaviour. More specifically, the relevant literature does not explicitly examine simultaneously how targeted and untargeted effects occur. The purpose of this paper is to examine the targeted and untargeted effects of an electricity display intervention on electricity, gas, and travel through a mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) approach. The findings indicate that in a sample of 19 participants, 2 had no behavioural or attitudinal changes, 2 had changes in electricity only, 11 had changes in electricity and gas, and 4 had changes in electricity, gas, and travel. Reasons for this are explored through illustrative case studies.

"The global market for smart electricity meters has grown rapidly in recent years and is anticipated to sustain its solid increase in the near future. By analyzing half-hourly meter data from over 4000 Irish households, this study seeks to examine the relationship between households’ attributes and their electricity demand through the following questions: (1) knowing a given set of household attributes, can we accurately classify households according to their demand volume and daily demand pattern and (2) can we infer some of the key households’ characteristics from their meter data. The attributes considered include the size, presence of kids, social class, employment status and the annual income of the households. A range of machine learning methods including tree-based algorithms, support vector machines and neural networks are deployed to answer these questions. The results suggest the potential for reasonably accurate segmentation of consumers according to their demand volume while the classification based on daily demand patterns were shown to be more challenging. For predicting household attributes, higher accuracy values are reported when predicting the household size, social class, and employment status. On the contrary, inferring the household income category and the presence of children in the household were shown to be more difficult.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"Through a social science approach rooted in grounded theory, this research paper provides a form of an uncertainty theory in organizations, exploring how alternate forms of rationality and approaches to dealing with uncertainty result in variation in energy efficiency related actions and outcomes. Through data analysis, structural conditions are identified, frames for considering energy efficiency are uncovered, and two approaches for dealing with uncertainty are interpreted. Hospitals that approach uncertainty by 'Demanding Certainty' make use of one of two frames: 'Temporal Silos' or' Alternate priorities'. These hospitals communicate by presenting, selling and confirming, resulting in risk avoiding organizations where individuals absorb associated risks, and long-term energy efficiency implementation stalls. Hospitals that approach uncertainty by 'Managing Complexity' envision energy efficiency as complementary to patient care and driving long-term resiliency. These hospitals communicate through negotiation and collaboration, expanding thinking beyond short term budgetary intervals, driving resiliency and bridging operational silos. Organizations, and not individuals, absorb risks associated with energy efficiency, and implementation of initiatives occur over longer time horizons.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"The vast transactional, trust and security advantages of Bitcoin are dwarfed by the intentionally resource-intensive design in its transaction verification process which now threatens the climate we depend upon for survival. Indeed Bitcoin mining and transactions are an application of Blockchain technology employing an inefficient use of scarce energy resources for a financial activity at a point in human development where world governments are scrambling to reduce energy consumption through their Paris Agreement climate change commitments and beyond to mitigate future climate change implications.Without encouraging more sustainable development of the potential applications of Blockchain technologies which can have significant social and economic benefits, their resource-intensive design combined now pose a serious threat to the global commitment to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The article examines government intervention choices to desocialise negative environmental externalities caused by high-energy consuming Blockchain technology designs.The research question explores how to promote the environmentally sustainable development of applications of Blockchain without damaging this valuable sector. It studies existing regulatory and fiscal policy approaches towards digital currencies in order to provide a basis for further legal and policy tools targeted at mitigating energy consumption of Blockchain technologies.

"As the cost of distributed power generation continues to decrease, technologies such as solar home systems and micro-grids become increasingly attractive in the quest for energy access. Here we show, however, that national rural electrification planning mostly continues to ignore distributed power generation. A detailed review of the national rural electrification plans of the twenty countries with the largest numbers of non-electrified households shows that distributed power generation is usually absent or at best a minor component of the strategy. Our original contribution is thus to show where and how national rural electrification planning lags behind technology and business models, with guidelines for future research on explaining these patterns.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"‘Energy storage’ comprises a range of technologies of varying maturity and cost-effectiveness, which are increasingly considered to be an important part in building the electricity system of the future. As with any potentially transformative technology, there remain questions of how, and under what context, electricity system stakeholders (new and old) will perceive the technology. Our interest in this paper is to identify and assess the political and sociotechnical system factors that stand to shape the extent to which energy storage can be considered transformational. To do so, we investigate the transformative potential of storage in Ontario, Canada, based on interviews with key electricity system stakeholders. We find that the transformative potential of energy storage is by no means preordained, and is instead intimately intertwined with the complex interactions between actors and institutional factors in each and across three electricity system subsectors.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"This article examines the global diffusion of two dominant renewable energy policies: feed-in tariffs (FIT) and renewable portfolio standards (RPS). It focuses on four mechanisms of policy diffusion: emulation, suasion, learning and competition. The findings of quantitative methods (logistic regression models and event history analysis) show strong support for emulation mechanisms in the diffusion of FIT and RPS. In the diffusion of FIT and RPS there is some support for learning and suasion. There is a robust finding of support that the competition mechanism does not explain diffusion of RPS and FIT.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"As the world’s most traded commodity, oil production is typically well monitored and analyzed. It also has established links to geopolitics, international relations, and security. Despite this attention, the illicit production, refining, and trade of oil and derivative products occur all over the world and provide significant revenues outside of the oversight and regulation of governments. A prominent manifestation of this phenomenon is how terrorist and insurgent organizations—including the Islamic State group, also known as ISIL/ISIS or Daesh—use oil as a revenue source. Understanding the spatial and temporal variation in production can help determine the scale of operations, technical capacity, and revenue streams. This information, in turn, can inform both security and reconstruction strategies. To this end, we use satellite multi-spectral imaging and ground-truth pre-war output data to effectively construct a real-time census of oil production in areas controlled by the ISIL terrorist group. More broadly, remotely measuring the activity of extractive industries in conflict-affected areas without reliable administrative data can support a broad range of public policy and decisions and military operations.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"Civic engagement is currently playing a major role in the transformation of European energy systems. In Germany, citizen-driven renewable energy cooperatives (RECs) are often presented as pioneers of change and as models for the development of energy initiatives within Europe. Current research on RECs focuses mainly on entrepreneurial adaptations and innovations; what is generally missing from the research, however, is a detailed consideration of the human dimensions of this engagement. In view of this, the present paper proposes applying the needs-oriented Human Scale Development Approach (HSDA) as a means of supporting civic engagement within a transdisciplinary research framework. It is argued that the needs perspective can be helpful in developing new strategies that support initiatives in their objective to remain stable and robust over the long term. The empirical part of the paper presents three case studies of German RECs which (1) explore the challenges encountered by active members in their everyday organizational efforts, (2) describe the potential benefits from their involvement, and (3) identify factors that encourage civic engagement. The results indicate that the challenges are inhibiting factors which not only jeopardize the groups’ shared objectives but also adversely influence the emotional well-being of those who are actively involved.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"This article makes an early attempt at connecting political science insights on the politics of carbon sequestration to a growing demand for knowledge about the potentials of negative emissions. Negative emissions from sequestering carbon is likely to be vital for fulfilling the 2 °C target. Thus, this article is a reality check on what states actually plan to do. Based on key states’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the international climate regime and off-the-record interviews with senior country representatives to the 2016 climate meeting in Marrakech, we find that states generally do not have policies to promote large-scale carbon sequestration or negative emissions. However, many states wish to make the most of terrestrial sinks, using current regime rules as part of their mitigation portfolios. We suggest that national strategies to promote negative emissions will remain absent until the international climate regime formalizes rules and incentives for such efforts, recognizing them as legitimate national contributions. Without a governance framework that admits such efforts, national initiatives on large-scale negative emissions cannot fulfill the purpose of climate policy in a two-level setting matching national interests and international commitments.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"The history of liquid bioenergy in Brazil is a meaningful source of information vis-à-vis the political economy dynamics that underlie low-carbon energy transitions. By studying the political economy of bioenergy under a historical long-run perspective, this research seeks to shed light on the interplay between governance and bioenergy transition. Understanding governance as the dynamic interface between private and public interests, in turn conditioned by the natural, institutional and technological context, we explore the sources of institutional and economic change regarding bioenergy development. Using an analytical framework designed to study bioenergy governance in the US, this inquiry addresses the Brazilian bioenergy transition. The analysis reveals that beyond the incremental learning process of institutional and industrial transformation, the historical patterns of bioenergy evolution result from the dynamics of governance between the agro-industry and the government, a historical process of convergence and conflict of opportunity costs regarding bioenergy penetration. Thus, by altering the expected gains of the key actors, contextual factors related to energy and agricultural markets affects the decision-making process at the private and public dimension of governance, determining by convergence or by conflict, the pace of institutional change, the development of markets and the historical transition of liquid bioenergy in Brazil.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"In the U.S., governance for oil and gas development has been increasingly devolved from centralized, relatively powerful governments to lower levels of government. At the same time, state governments increasingly preempt local authority, resulting in significant state-local contestation over oil and gas governance. The purpose of this analysis is to understand what level of government (i.e. local, state or federal) Colorado residents believe should regulate the oil and gas industry (referred to as governance scale preferences) in this era of neoliberalism, devolution, and state preemption. Colorado has been an epicenter of unconventional oil and gas production for years and is one of the most heavily-drilled states in the U.S. The state also lauds itself as being at the forefront of state-level regulation of the industry, key to our concerns here Descriptive results indicated that few support federal exemptions while many respondents endorse local regulation. Further, few variables have consistent results in the binary logistic regression models. Broadly, our analysis suggests that the public seems to endorse a complex, multi-layered system of governance for oil and gas development, suggesting that current efforts to concentrate regulatory power in state governments is at odds with public preferences.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"Scholars have identified many determinants of regulatory outcomes in unconventional oil and gas development, but few have focused on industry structure. We examine the effects of company size and ownership on revenue sharing outcomes in North Dakota (ND), drawing on political economy bargaining models. We examine firm-level characteristics of ND’s oil producers from 2005 to 2015, matching these data against revenue sharing outcomes and estimating effects using graphical and statistical methods. Along with this core analysis, we conduct key informant interviews with four elite actors in the unconventional oil and gas sector in ND, to provide supplementary details on industry structure and voluntary contributions to local communities. Our findings suggest that when industry is dominated by larger, publicly-traded firms, there is more revenue sharing between firms and the state government. However, we find anecdotal evidence that smaller, local firms may better target resources towards local needs. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the varied outcomes at the sub-national and sub-state level and expands the “resource curse” literature that suggests that industry characteristics shape local outcomes.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"The transition towards low-energy buildings in the United Kingdom is challenging. Several policy changes have affected the actions and agency of actors. Drawing on the sustainability transitions literature, we analyse the development of the low-energy homes niche, focusing on the dynamics between intermediary organisations and policy development for low-energy homes. Based on rich interview and secondary data, we note how the existence and activities of transition intermediaries are enabled or curtailed by policy changes. We identify niche development phases along with the position and activities of intermediary organisations. In the predevelopment phase, non-state transition intermediaries have formed when government policy has been weak or market-based. During take-off, targeted policy initiatives have created protective spaces and stimulated the emergence of new intermediaries aiming to consolidate the niche. State-affiliated intermediaries have been established as part of active energy efficiency policy, but later ceased to exist or became privatised. Existing organisations have adopted intermediary functions to advance low-energy homes in response to policy. Furthermore, intermediaries have on occasion influenced policy development, often through cooperation among an ecology of intermediaries. In conclusion, we raise questions regarding intermediaries in the changing governance context.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"After the Paris agreement on climate change (2015) climate change politics is no longer about raising awareness but about shaping the sustainability transition itself. It requires us to rethink the role of scientific knowledge, shifting from a tradition of “expected futures” to an approach focusing on “desirable futures” and ways to get there. We argue the sustainability transitions scholarship tends to see constructions of the future (visions, scenarios, predictions etc.) as explanans (that what explains) while constructions of the future are rarely seen as explanandum (that what should be explained). The article introduces the concept of ‘Techniques of Futuring’ defined as practices bringing together actors around one or more imagined futures and through which actors come to share particular orientations for action, to get a grip on the actual acts of ‘futuring’. The empirical focus is on ‘2050—An Energetic Odyssey’, a process centred around an elaborate multimedia installation, introducing large scale exploitation of the North Sea for harvesting off shore wind energy taking place in 2015 and 2016.

"Sustainable energy transitions – broadly described as moving away from fossil fuels toward renewable resources and reducing energy demand– are emerging across the world, albeit in uneven ways. Scholarship on energy transitions has highlighted the importance of how these transitions may be facilitated or impeded by both governance and politics, and the influence of urban dynamics and histories on these transitions. Using an emphasis on multiscalar governance, this paper analyses emergent energy reconfigurations in Australia, with two purposes. The first is to understand more richly the dynamics that are differentially reworking possibilities for more sustainable energy infrastructure and energy demand in a fossil-fuel dependent nation. Second, we focus on the role of cities, considering the workings of urban energy transitions, most especially through governing the materiality of urban commercial space. Drawing on empirical examples from Australia’s two largest cities we suggest that the urban is a crucial nexus through which energy transitions are instigated, manifest and contested. We conclude by confirming that the strategic pursuit of political-economic interests of the urban, in partnership with other state and non-state actors, creates opportunities for energy transitions rendered difficult by institutional and material obduracies.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"Generally speaking, increasing rural marginalisation in sub-Saharan Africa has sat alongside a rise in energy poor homes in rural off-grid communities. Even measures meant to improve electricity access have exacerbated the energy access gap between grid connected and off-grid homes. For example, the South African Non-Grid Electrification Policy Guidelines for electrifying off-grid, rural poor homes promote the adoption of Solar Home Systems (SHS), which are expected to produce 7.5 kWh/month on average. However, for poor homes within grid coverage, the Free Basic Electricity (FBE) programme allocates 50 kWh/month. This paper investigates the resulting disparity in terms of electricity cost (ZAR/kWh), including associated costs for heating, cooking and other needs. It does so through the energy justice framework, highlighting the mismatch in policy formulation (procedural injustice), resource distribution (distributive injustice) and spatial distribution (injustice in the recognition of population groups’ special needs). Through a combination of mathematics and social science perspectives, it then moves beyond a critique of the current SHS system to proposes a new one: a hybrid generation approach with a flexible pricing scheme and centralized system of operation that is both ethically compliant and capable of improving electricity access to off-grid communities with standards comparable to grid access.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"The role of underlying assumptions about justice in the construction of climate geoengineering knowledge is explored, based on a review of climate modelling studies focused on stratospheric aerosol injection. Such emerging technologies would create distinctively new climates, closer to the present climate than those resulting from unabated emissions; but with different winners and losers, in part as a result of implications for energy systems. Embedded presuppositions about the nature and practice of modelling are exposed, as are unexplored and narrow utilitarian and distributional conceptions of justice. The implications of these underlying assumptions and values for the discourses of climate geoengineering are considered. It is argued that they obscure the identification and consideration of a range of potential injustices arising in the pursuit of climate geoengineering; and create and reproduce asymmetries in power regarding the discourses and evaluations of climate geoengineering prospects. In particular, optimistic climate geoengineering discourses risk sustaining elite interests in high-carbon energy economies. Some suggestions are offered to improve the design, deployment and interpretation of climate engineering models in trans-disciplinary research so as to mitigate these problems.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"Over the last decade, green growth policies have drawn increasing interest. OECD, UNEP, the World Bank and the EC have had several initiatives on the issue, and the Nordic countries have a special program on it. Definitions and indicator sets have been developed, though critics have pointed out that most initiatives amount to little more than a greenwashing of conventional economic growth. The paper proposes and discusses two definitions of green growth, one weak and one strong. Both build on resource- and carbon productivity measures, but whereas the weak definition requires absolute decoupling, the strong or “genuine green growth” requires sufficient decoupling to achieve science based targets for planetary boundaries. The approach is tested at country levels, starting with the climate boundary, by analyzing progress on carbon productivity (“CAPRO”) in Nordic countries since 2000. Results show that so far, among Nordic countries, Sweden, Finland and Denmark have achieved genuine green growth, while Norway has not. Implications for policy and communication of green growth are discussed.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"The increasing focus on energy efficient operation of vessels can be seen in both legislation and research. This paper focuses attention on the human factor influencing energy efficiency and explores the conditions for improving energy efficiency in working vessels taking situational awareness (SA) theory into consideration.The study builds on two cases: an offshore supply vessel for the oil & gas industry and an installation vessel for wind turbines. The study used qualitative methods based on 49 interviews with seafarers and onshore employees from the vessels and shipping companies.The study has identified that the energy efficiency of a ship is mainly influenced by legislation and the praxis formed on board. The results showed that the theory on SA is very a useful tool in explaining the factors affecting the energy efficiency of a vessel and the praxis.The study has shown that obtaining a more energy efficient operation is complex and depends not only on the officer on board the ship. The improvement of energy efficiency is possible, but there is a need to understand the complexity of the issue and to involve both the crew and the entire system around the ship, and to obtain a shared perspective of energy efficient operation. Furthermore, in order to improve energy efficiency in shipping companies, there is a need to support the seafarers in gaining more skills for operating the ship more energy efficiently; to do this the right way there is a need to create an understanding of the system by the authorities, ship owners and charterers.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"International agreements on energy access and climate change, formulated according to neoliberal orthodoxy, will drive significant finance to developing countries for clean technology investments. But critics call for more active state intervention – a developmental approach – arguing that free markets alone will not deliver what is required. This creates the potential for confrontation between contradictory ideologies in national policymaking and implementation: neoliberalism in global agreements versus developmentalism in national policy.The Kenyan photovoltaics (PV) market has long-experienced neoliberal-developmental policy interactions, reflecting on which can illuminate how such encounters might unfold in the future. We construct a new ‘niche political economy’ theoretical framework to analyse these past interactions, constituting one of three contributions we offer. The second is empirical, showing how PV practitioners, national policymakers and global development actors have negotiated their policymaking encounters over time. Our third contribution offers reflections on the issues explored, discussing what this might mean for future neoliberal-developmental encounters.We find that action on the ground will emerge from messy negotiated interactions between competing ideologies rather than be determined by powerful neoliberal actors. As such, realising global energy and climate ambitions becomes even more uncertain unless long-term active niche-building resources are secured in international agreements.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"This article presents new empirical research on what it takes to provide enduring access to affordable, reliable and useful electricity services for all. We analyze and synthesize the long-term experiences with three different systems for village-scale solar power supply in India, Senegal and Kenya. Since this scale of electricity provision forms part of village infrastructure, it requires particular types of knowledge, policies and support mechanisms. This research therefore investigates how village-scale solar systems can be designed, implemented, sustained and replicated in ways that make them accessible and useful for the community members. Drawing on a socio-technical and practice-oriented approach, we show that the electricity system’s degree of adaptedness to its social context affects many important qualities of the system such as the relevance of the available electricity services for the people, the system’s operational and economic sustainability and the potential for replication. Achieving such adaptation notably requires a flexible approach on the part of implementers, funders and local actors before, during and after implementation. We also show the need for institutionalization of decentralized electricity provision, discuss the current ambiguities in policies, regulations and funding mechanisms for village-scale solar power, and provide recommendations to policy makers and donors.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"This paper examines the gendered implications of various types of electricity access in rural Kenya spanning from the central grid to solar-based systems such as community projects, village scale supply and private solar home systems (SHS).Drawing on material collected in Homa Bay and Kitui counties in 2016, the paper examines the gendered set-up, organisation and effects of solarpowered electricity access as compared with the central grid. The paper employs a framework for analysing women’s empowerment through electrification, which draws on Kabeer, Friedman as well as anthropology, socio-technical system theory and practice theory.The results show that people tend to cherish solar-based solutions whereas the grid is perceived to be costly, unreliable and unavailable. As to the gendered organisation of supply, men dominate within the grid, mini-grids and private suppliers, leaving an important potential for women’s empowerment untapped. Two community projects included women’s ‘hands-on’ participation and spurred local discourses about women’s capabilities.Access is also gendered on the user side. Because men tend to own the houses, have a higher income and a moral right to make major decisions, fixed connections and high subscription fees provide women with less agency than what is the case in decentralised systems of supply.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"One neglected socio-cultural and political dimension to the rapid diffusion of solar power in Sub-Saharan Africa is the question of what happens when things fall apart. Investors in the small-scale renewable energy sector are increasingly concerned with the status of broken or non-functioning products and there is an emerging consensus around the need for centralised recycling systems as the solution to future flows of ‘solar waste’.But what does the afterlife of off-grid solar products look like from below? Grounded in anthropology, geography and economic sociology, this paper tracks the impact of off grid solar products through contexts of breakdown, repair, and disposal. Combining stakeholder interviews, a longitudinal survey of product failure rates in Kenya and ethnographic research at a repair workshop in the town of Bomet, we challenge narratives of energy transitions that fail to address the environmental consequences of mass consumption and present an alternative approach to solar waste embedded in cultures and economies of repair.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"This special issue focusses on the now rapidly growing solar photovoltaics markets across various geographies and scales in Africa. Herein we summarise the contributions of the component papers and position them within the context of the sustainable energy access literature. We argue that there is an urgent need for greater attention to the neglected socio-cultural and political dimensions of sustainable energy access, dimensions that are vital to understand if ambitious global commitments to sustainable energy for all by 2030 are to be achieved. Included in this special issue are papers on the systemic and socio-technical nature of energy access transitions; their politics and political economy; gendered dimensions; critiques of their technologically determinist framing and the implications for marginalising local actors; and, perhaps for the first time in the energy access literature, application of social practice perspectives to the energy access challenge. The result is a diverse range of empirically-grounded, theoretically and methodologically novel approaches, providing new insights into and understandings of the neglected socio-cultural and political dimensions of sustainable energy access.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"Solar Home Systems (SHSs) and other off-grid solutions have shown promise in addressing the energy access gap for those with no or unreliable grid services. With that promise comes the expectation to boost socio-economic well-being of newly-connected households, who will continue climbing up the energy ladder. Despite the growing appreciation for the need to go beyond the techno-economics of energy access, and the recognition of the value of socio-technical systems perspective, the wider sociology of energy consumption and behaviour among adopters of off-grid solar solutions has been poorly explored. In this paper, we apply the Social Practice Theory (SPT) and the energy and solar energy ladder framework to analyse energy consumption and the changing social practices of SHSs users in Rwanda. We find that social practices change dynamically and depend on available appliances, whereas energy consumption follows a complex path but does not increase in a linear manner with time or more appliances. Insights can prove useful for public and private agencies working on off-grid electrification, offering a new perspective on the energy and solar energy ladder concepts while also showing the importance of social aspects of energy access even at relatively low levels of provision currently offered by SHSs.",Volume 44,October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/44/suppl/C,6
"The increase of right-wing populist parties, post-truth politics, and local resistance challenges the policies and politics of sustainable energy transformation. The contributions of this Special Issue address at least one of these political phenomena in the context of sustainable energy transformation. They show that populism, especially right-wing populism, and post-truth politics indicate rising political polarisation on climate and energy policies while local resistance indicates the political nature of sustainable energy transformations. More research is needed to explore the causes, nature, and consequences of the increase in extreme positions on climate and energy policies across political parties and individuals.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"Over the past twenty years debates on the supply of, and demand for, useful energy have often been characterised by exaggeration on the one part and denial on the other.Exaggeration has primarily come from vested interests in promoting certain forms of renewable energy. These interests have been pitted against fossil fuel ones in claiming the need for transition to a low carbon world. Such views have often taken insufficient account of locational, technical, and other performance limitations. Their views have increasingly rested upon the politicisation of the climatic change debate, despite this topic’s basic uncertainties. Local interests and concerns, and the claims of ‘populism’, have also intruded.Denial has come from those who are inclined to dismiss the notion that human activities can change global near surface temperatures, whereas given the uncertainties a precautionary approach is required. Sustainable energy transformation is occurring, but we also see sub-optimal decision-making and exaggerated claims, as is to be expected in an age of “post-truth politics”.“Post-truth politics” need to be abandoned in the genuine pursuit of truth and realism. Failing this, social networking will hinder effective policymaking and its implementation.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"The energy transitions necessary to address climate change mitigation and adaptation manifest unevenly, varying in nature, context, distribution of benefits and radical depth. While populist developments and economic protectionism are often viewed pejoratively, we argue that a critical reading reveals clear connections to progressive social struggles. Frustration with elite capture of political processes and economic assets manifests in a populist desire to redistribute political power via nationalist or localist economic policies. Debates over the benefits of ownership by 'the people' and representation of marginalized actors are particularly acute in settler states. We examine Indigenous led energy transitions in Aotearoa New Zealand, via a critical reading of scholarship on populist resistance and protectionist responses to energy market liberalization, together with a distinctive Māori sustainability ethic as articulated by Māori scholars. Despite significant and ongoing challenges, we find that Māori principles and energy initiatives,particularly in geothermal heat, power and energy efficiency, hold unique and radical potential to lead the coming energy transition.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"In the search for environmentally sustainable economic paradigms, the green growth approach has been developed by the EU and economic networks, as part of a wider sustainability discourse. While the EU repeatedly promotes sustainable development in the context of its greened hegemonic economic discourse, its member states’ frustrations regarding the EU’s integrative policies have been a breeding ground for counter-hegemonic populism. Such anti-EU and typically right-wing populism promotes national and conventional modes of energy production that is emancipated from foreign providers, science, and EU legislation; and it reveals post-truth tendencies in the sense that it relativizes conventional knowledge as well causation and correlation. In this paper, we seek to uncover the populist and post-truth tendencies within the hegemonic green growth discourse itself. In our paper, we seek to unmask the myth of sustainable energy transformation of the green growth discourse, in terms of a hegemon’s engagement – EU and associated economic networks – with post-truth: we find that post-truth tendencies are not only manifested by counter-hegemonic anti-EU and right-wing populism but is also expressed within the environmental populist expressions of the hegemonic green growth discourse itself.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"An early implementer of feed-in tariffs, Germany soon became feed-in champion, continuously resisting pressures – from the European Commission in particular – to adopt a competition-oriented approach. The European Commission never approved of the German feed-in tariff, seeing it as illegal state aid. However, after the good results in deployment of renewables, other countries followed suit and feed-in tariffs became the most popular support scheme for renewables in Europe. Despite this success, the nature of the Energiewende changed. Germany broke with its feed-in tradition two and a half decades later, introducing pilot auctions for solar energy in 2014. In 2016, it moved from a scheme under which every provider of renewable energy was entitled to support to a competition-oriented approach based on auctioning. Drawing on perspectives of historical institutionalism and adopting qualitative methods, we argue that the success of the feed-in tariff in terms of deployment of renewables altered coalitions of interests in Germany. The German government introduced auctioning with a view to controlling cost developments and protecting the conventional energy industries from insolvency. This happened under considerable EU pressures, given the European Commission’s state aid guidelines, which prescribe a competition-oriented approach.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"Recent socio-political events - such as Brexit - have provoked discussion and uncertainties about the future of the European Union, including European sustainable energy transitions. Nevertheless, not much research in the energy and social science domain has discussed and empirically explored how these socio-political events and related processes - rise in right-wing populism, post-truth politics - are shaped by and impact public beliefs about energy issues and the role of changes in people's different-level identities (local, national, European). In this paper, we discuss the importance of further exploring these ideas in energy social science research. We examine results of the Eurobarometer survey in the time span 2007–2016, and of two different representative surveys of United Kingdom adults, conducted in 2007 and 2012. This data allowed us to explore similarities and differences during this period regarding attitudes and beliefs about high voltage power lines and other energy and climate change related issues at different levels, and associated identities. Results suggest that feelings of belonging to different imaginary communities play out socio-political and psychological intergroup relations. We conclude that the ways that these impact on people's responses regarding energy issues at local, national and European levels represent promising directions for future research.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"This paper analyzes factors that lead to opposition towards policies in Switzerland that promote a clean energy transition. During legislative processes, both the elite and general citizens can develop resistance towards such policies. The article considers those two perspectives and determines, on both levels, factors that explain opposition. We also specifically take into account whether climate change skepticism, i.e., questioning that climate change is real and human-induced, is a key factor that leads to opposition. Furthermore, we employ structural equation models to account for interactions between the elite and general citizens. The results show that political actors who reject the idea of man-made climate change also oppose the promotion of a clean energy transition, and more generally that elite actors influence how citizens think about the issue. At the citizen level, an increase in climate change skepticism has a negative impact on levels of support for clean energy policy. The link is mainly determined by party affiliation. We conclude that potential strategies for achieving a clean energy transition should focus on motivating citizens because they generally seem to be less polarized and partisan, and thus less opposed to new solutions, than the elite, who tend to be more constrained in their actions.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"Using populist tactics to frame energy transitions is neither new nor a predominantly Western phenomenon. In sub-Saharan Africa, populist leaders have long dispensed energy endowments for political gains. This paper studies populism and energy in Uganda, a highly energy-deprived country. Fact-checking recent governmental speeches and policies reveals a hefty presence of post-truth politics in Uganda’s energy sector. President Yoweri Museveni’s attempt to highlight developmental achievements have informed overly optimistic depictions of electricity planning, generation, transmission, distribution and pricing. We argue that the success of post-truth politics as a populist instrument may depend on the public’s ability to easily falsify the respective claims. While populist narratives have generally helped to legitimise Museveni’s leadership, our novel household survey data suggest that they have failed to mask the observable reality of poor governmental electrification performance. Respondents held sceptical opinions of electrification achievements, infrastructure status and the attribution of high electricity tariffs. Over 80% did not believe in the truthfulness of Uganda’s energy debate, a result robust to different age, gender, residential, educational and income levels. This well-informed Ugandan public, paired with a growing international presence and global development goals pose unprecedented pressures on Uganda’s government to eventually deliver factual, large-scale electrification.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"We synthesize the empirical contributions from the existing applied economics literature examining the influence of institutions and governance on environmental policy, environmental performance, and green investment. The literature on the influence of populism and public opinion on environmental policy adoption is also reviewed in line with the special issue. First, the paper describes how the relationship between institutions, environmental performance and environmental policy have been conceptualized and operationalized in the literature and summarizes the main findings. The second part of the paper outlines avenues for future research with specific attention to the energy transition and climate change literature. With respect to the positivist worldview adopted by this paper, we highlight various opportunities for empirical work that have recently emerged with the growing availability of data in the field of green investments, climate, and energy policy. Expanding the current empirical literature towards these research topics is of both scientific and policy relevance and can provide important insights on the broader field of sustainability transition and sustainable development. Regarding the alternative, non-positivist worldviews, future research could explore ways to connect the richer approaches such as complex adaptive systems and socio-technical transition studies with applied econometric methods, as well as future-oriented studies.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"In this paper we pursue the hypothesis that acceptance of the energy transition is not merely determined by technology acceptance but also by the perception of socio-institutional stakeholders and the perception of fairness. We test an acceptance model which includes the following main predictors: attitudes towards the risks of the energy transition and attitudes towards the technology options such as wind power, photovoltaic systems or transmission lines. Additional influences are assumed to arise from the perception of regional added values and the trust in various socio-institutional stakeholders. Furthermore, we expect fairness to be a mediating variable for acceptance. In this paper we test the model empirically with a representative German sample (N = 2009) in a structural equation model (SEM) for the acceptance of onshore wind power. Moreover, we analyse whether differences in the factors are related to the German regions North, East, West and South since we assume regional landscapes, renewable energy sources and socio-political contexts to be important for acceptance. Results show evidence that perception of stakeholders and fairness is important for the regional acceptance. In addition, results show that, among the four regions, different factors are relevant for acceptance. Results are discussed and conclusions for governance are drawn.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"Energy system transitions in democracies require that national interests and central planning are reconciled with the public’s preferences. This pilot study investigates public support for the Swiss national energy strategy and two specific technologies that are part of it: expansion of hydropower and deep geothermal energy. It addresses two research questions. First, how does public support for a national energy transition differ from public support for specific technologies endorsed in an energy transition strategy? Second, are there differences in the factors influencing public support for these technologies? We investigate these questions empirically with a survey (N = 640), focusing on understanding the role lay-people’s expectations about the future energy system, political ideology, and future orientation play in generating support for these two levels of public support and for two technologies with different characteristics. We find that while support for an energy transition is well explained by above factors, this is true to a much lesser extent for technology support. One conclusion is that support for an energy transition and for energy technologies is politicized to varying degrees, which is why their acceptability may be less shaped by their objective characteristics, but rather by subjective perceptions and beliefs the public holds towards them.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"Much of the literature on local opposition to wind development is based on small-N case studies of controversial cases. This focus has led to an emphasis on the so-called “social gap” between positive general attitudes toward renewable energy development and local resistance to actual proposals. Instead, we conduct a fuzzy set/Qualitative Comparative Analysis of 53 proposals for wind energy development in the Western United States to better understand both the amount of local opposition and the factors and processes that shape it. We find that while some level of local opposition to wind proposals is not rare, it is typically restricted to more benign activities that require few resources and take place in standard institutional settings. Drawing on insights from the literatures on social acceptance of wind and social movement studies, we show that proximity to protected areas, political opportunity, and opponents’ framing of the risks posed by wind development are important factors in driving community resistance. These findings suggest that resistance to wind energy proposals is more likely to be shaped by existing processes for public participation than to shape them, and that calls to streamline regulatory processes to expedite development due to local resistance may be premature.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"Energy infrastructure projects often bring along protests. Protests as a form of political participation reveal perceptions of locals regarding a specific project. However, it is still unclear who protesters are and what drives them. Specifically, the attitude towards protest has not been extensively studied. We conducted an online survey study with 464 participants and used partially-least squares structural equation modeling to identify antecedents to protest attitudes. We included opinion leadership, trust in institutions, political efficacy and demographic factors in our model to determine possible causal relationships between these factors. We found that protest attitude is predominantly influenced by income, protest experience and political efficacy.

"The literature on energy transitions tends to focus on forces operating within entire sectors or across multiple sectors, and usually at the national or international-level. This focus can disguise the fact that transitions often have uneven geographic effects, and specifically adverse consequences for some frontline communities. In this article, we examine how U.S. communities have fared during the current transition toward lower carbon sources of energy. We analyze data compiled from interviews and surveys with stakeholders working in three locations: Detroit, Michigan; St. Louis, Missouri; and Appalachian coal country. We find that a majority of stakeholders perceive evidence of the energy transition in their communities and are concerned about their community’s ability to adapt. Our results, however, suggest heterogeneity among perceptions across the study sites. Stakeholders in Appalachia are most concerned about local job loss and employment availability, with more severe implications for younger and older generations, while those in Detroit and St. Louis express more concerns about the rising cost of energy and the implications for low-income residents. We also find that these stakeholder perceptions do not substantially change after recent political shifts at the federal level but sub-national activism and collaboration has increased.","Volume 43, Pages 1-158 (September 2018)",September 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/43/suppl/C,7
"Fred Cottrell’s pioneering work on the energy-society interface is built on a sociology able to explain technology’s social and environmental impacts without relying on technological determinism. While technology conditions the types of possible social structures and value hierarchies that are amendable to its physical feedback and the range of ends that can be pursued through its use, societies choose whether or not to adopt technologies, and how they are used, based on preexisting social structures, values, ecological and geographical conditions, and, as stressed by Cottrell, power inequalities. Through this framework, Cottrell made substantial and still pertinent contributions, including a call for a social science that is conscious of the likelihood of future shrinking energy throughput relevant to discussions surrounding planned economic contraction (“degrowth”). To help illuminate the unique elements of his approach, Cottrell is compared to the following overlapping figures: Leslie A. White, Julian Steward, Lewis Mumford, and Howard T.

"The social sciences are increasingly called upon to engage with how decision-makers and stakeholders tackle climate and energy challenges. However, creating or taking part in these new arenas is not unproblematic, and arguably, social scientists have not properly reflected on what types of engagement are most useful. In this Perspective we argue that such engagement is most productive if we can find or create activities where our core competences, epistemological toolbox and critical sensibilities can be put to use. Therefore, we propose three modes through which social science can productively engage with climate and energy challenges in society: (1) producing and situating actionable knowledge, (2) critically reframing discourses, and (3) connecting actors and processes. Combined, these open up a space for social scientists to both critically assess and simultaneously participate in sustainability transformations.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"A clean cooking energy transition necessitates effortful behaviour changes by cooks, financial decision makers, and other family members. A new inter-disciplinary CI-CHANGE model, rooted in technology adoption and behaviour change literature, provides an integrated framework to study the transition process. It provides new testable hypotheses on the how and why of the transition process using behavioural constructs such as perceptions and habits. In contrast, the current approach is to examine socio-demographic conditions and market/technology characteristics to identify- ‘who’ are likely to move away from solid fuels and ‘under what conditions’. CI-CHANGE combines elements of the Transtheoretical Model (health behaviour change psychology), Theory of Planned Behaviour (social psychology), and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (information systems research) to identify & prioritize intervention focus areas. Such framing highlights three key gaps in the current approach. First, based on process factor conditions of target audience, differential intervention strategies are necessary; second, post-sales interventions are required to support complex and effortful endeavor of accepting a new technology while fighting the old habit of traditional cooking; and third, entire transition process is fragile due to seasonal changes and no-cost reversal to solid fuels.

"The extraction of oil and gas has increasingly shaped Canada’s economy and culture in recent years. As Canada attempts to move toward a low carbon economy, it is important to know how Canadians perceive the risks and opportunities associated with various energy sources. In particular, fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is one such energy extraction technique that has received much media attention but little systematic research from social scientists in Canada. Drawing on survey data from a representative sample of citizens in a province that has utilized fracking extensively (British Columbia) and one that has placed a moratorium on its use (New Brunswick), this article examines public perceptions of the use of hydraulic fracturing. In particular, this paper explores the risks and opportunities people perceive from this technology in these different provincial energy contexts. The findings suggest that while New Brunswick residents saw more benefits and fewer risks from fracking than British Columbia residents, the variables shaping perceptions within each province were mostly similar. We argue that contemporary risk theorizing should more closely consider how people perceive opportunities associated with the use of this disruptive technology as well as how context shapes people’s perceptions.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"The energy efficient retrofit of existing building stocks can help to address various social, economic and environmental objectives. As the most cost-effective and least disruptive retrofit options have regularly been implemented as a priority, initiatives that seek to encourage continued retrofit are likely to require thoughtful improvements in their design. Understanding the population of households that may be interested in retrofit as a heterogeneous rather than a homogenous group is a critical part of improving support for retrofit. In this research, we use Q-methodology to disaggregate the home owner-occupier population of the UK and create narratives that represent their experience of home renovations. We consider the experience of general home renovations as typically households do not see these as distinctive from energy efficient retrofit. The narratives present a holistic perspective by incorporating a comprehensive range of the influences on the renovation experience. The developed narratives – ‘Organised and seeking greater comfort’, ‘Settled and performing a functional upgrade’, ‘Growing and needing a family home’ and ‘A lot to do and no time like the present’ – provide the opportunity to better understand those making renovation decisions and subsequently develop more appropriate interventions to promote retrofit.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"Keeping global warming well below 2 °C entails radically transforming global energy production and use. However, one important mitigation option, the use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), has so far received only limited attention as regards the sociopolitical preconditions for its deployment. Using questionnaire data from UN climate change conferences, this paper explores the influence of expertise, actor type, and origin on respondents’ a) preferences for investing in BECCS, b) views of the role of BECCS as a mitigation technology, globally and domestically, and c) assessment of possible domestic barriers to BECCS deployment. Non-parametric statistical analysis reveals the low priority assigned to investments in BECCS, the anticipated high political and social constraints on deployment, and a gap between its low perceived domestic potential to contribute to mitigation and a slightly higher perceived global potential. The most important foreseen deployment constraints are sociopolitical, which in turn influence the economic feasibility of BECCS. However, these constraints (e.g. lack of policy incentives and social acceptance) are poorly captured in climate scenarios, a mismatch indicating a need for both complemented model scenarios and further research into sociopolitical preconditions for BECCS.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"With increasing demand for renewable energy, research focusing on social acceptance of production facilities has firmly established itself over the past decades. While the influence of worldviews on individuals’ perceptions and behaviour has received widespread scholarly attention regarding a variety of related issues, social acceptance of renewable energy technologies (RET) has not been one of them. The study presented here addresses this shortcoming in the literature by examining the impact of various constructs, including worldviews, with respect to individuals’ acceptance of RET in their vicinity. The study builds on a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Our findings suggest that RET belief is most strongly associated with acceptance regarding the construction of RET in participants’ community. Further, we find that the more strongly participants feel about a variety of motives that generally support the use of renewable energies, the more accepting they are of local RET power plants. Regarding the effect of worldviews, we find that individuals who value the common good and equality are more supportive of RET in their vicinity.

"Most Latin-American countries have undergone policy reforms in their Energy Sector during the last 60 years. In Paraguay, despite several attempts at introducing policy innovations, the organisation of the sector has remained virtually unchanged. Why have attempts at introducing policy changes failed? While crucial for the countrýs development and the future of the regions’ energy sector, there has been little academic study of Paraguay’s energy policy-making processes. This paper presents an account of how the politics have influenced the current state of energy policy in Paraguay through the lens of Kingdon’s multiple streams approach (MSA). The analysis suggests that battle for political power, as well as changes in government, have played a key role in hampering change during the period under study, weakening the efforts of policy entrepreneurs. The absence of Kingdon’s conditions for policy change also offers a way of understanding sociotechnical ‘regime resistance’. In terms of policy implications where institutional change is an objective, the case implies a need to empower policy entrepreneurs, here including the Vice Minister of Mines and Energy via the creation of a dedicated Ministry for Energy.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"The energy policy of the EU is established around the objectives of sustainability, competitiveness, and security of supply. These objectives are embodied in targets known as the “20-20-20”. The targets concern decreasing Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) generation, increasing the share of renewables in total energy consumption, and raising energy efficiency. This paper analyses the target achievements through Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and a classification of schemes that uses the typology derived from three sources: World Energy Council’s (WEC) energy trilemma, Fragile States Index (FSI), taking a comparative perspective across countries. It uses mathematical programming, and the resulting efficiency levels reveal the effectiveness of the input parameters in terms of the policy toolbox, motivators, barriers and other economic, cultural and social factors, and the execution practices for achieving the 20-20-20 targets. These efficiency values aid policy makers addressing the process parameters towards target achievements. The results show that WEC scores and FSI performances are not direct indicators of performances in terms of target achievements. For instance, Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom were not found to be as efficient as their standings would suggest, whereas Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Malta and Romania have the highest efficiency values.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"Prosuming – where private households use photovoltaics to produce electricity at home – has proliferated across Western countries, but growth rates have varied significantly. Focusing on Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom, this article explores the major factors that influence national prosumer figures between 1990 and 2017, and whether a development pathway can be identified. Support schemes, direct regulatory provisions, information and third-party installer markets are analysed through document studies, controlling for domestic context. This study confirms that changes in support schemes have been influential for the development of prosuming in all three countries; access to information and the presence of a third-party market have also been important. There are indications of differences elsewhere in the domestic context. For Germany and the UK, decarbonization has been a significant driving force for policy, unlike in Norway, where a boost in prosuming is now underway. While all three countries show similar early interactions between market and regulatory provisions, different national policy drivers indicate that different national prosumer pathways are possible.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"Over the next several decades, the world will undergo an energy transition as it shifts away from coal and oil to less carbon intensive energy sources. This process will create economic winners and losers, but these winners and loser will not be limited to corporations and their investors. Instead, communities that have developed around coal, oil, and gas extraction and processing will be negatively impacted if this energy transition occurs. Here, we provide first-order estimates of the socioeconomic vulnerability to decarbonization among U.S. counties. There are a small number of U.S. counties that appear to be highly vulnerable to decarbonization, and this suggests that policymakers could take a spatially-targeted approach to mitigating the socioeconomic impacts, similar to the approach of the Appalachian Regional Commission. Such a targeted approach may allow for a Just Transition to a low carbon economy.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8

Our results found that micropolitical and macropolitical factors are drivers that influence the emergence of first- and second-order learning. In turn, this learning moulds three different strategies proposed by this grassroots initiative, namely: commercial, social, and empowering strategies. Our results give insights to illustrate that, in order to develop radical transformative changes towards sustainability it is not enough to merely scale-up the regime (commercial strategy) or make sustainable and social proposals (social strategy), unless these aims are achieved through an empowering process that transforms our current values and relations (empowering strategy).",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"Local population actions determine the level of renewability of local energy systems in the context of energy transition goals. Local population makes energy choices based on the availability of different territorial resources and limits, i.e. natural or environmental, technological, and social ones. The aim of this research is to identify the main dimensions and aspects of territory that can address its change towards energy transition. Indeed, energy system is not only technology matter. Socio-energy and territorial approaches (Osti, 2010; Jessop et al., 2008 [2]) underline the importance of features and relationships between the territorial systems: natural, technological, economic, legislative, social, and cultural ones. This research identifies substantial, procedural, and relational dimensions or characteristics of territorial energy systems based on the Conflict Management Triangle (European Forest Institute, 1996).1084 journal papers have been selected based on specific criteria, allowing 168 papers to be analyzed using NVIVO11plus®. Following the qualitative and quantitative method applied for the systematized literature review, 15 dimensions and 41 sub-dimensions related to local population choices about energy transition have been selected. This is a scientific attempt to use a content analysis software (NVIVO11plus) in this scientific domain.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"Studies of societal engagement with socio-technical change are undergoing a systemic turn. Rather than simply viewing public engagement in science, policy and behavioural change in terms of discrete cases, key social theories in deliberative democracy, practice theory, socio-technical transitions and co-productionist scholarship in science and technology studies (STS) are moving to consider how diverse forms of participation interrelate in wider systems. In this paper we take stock of these advances to develop a conceptual framework for understanding ecologies of participation in socio-technical and democratic systems, grounded in relational co-productionist theory in STS. The framework is illustrated through empirical analysis of a systematic mapping of participation in UK energy system transitions between 2010 and 2015. This provides the first insights into system-wide patternings, diversities and inequalities of energy participation, the significant types of interrelation between practices of public engagement within wider ecologies of participation, and their mutual construction with political cultures and constitutions. The value and implications of adopting an ecologies of participation approach are considered with respect to the theoretical, empirical and practical challenges of understanding and building more inclusive, responsible and just socio-technical (energy) transitions.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"The effects of renewable energy transitions on energy costs and economic growth have led to cost concerns and a prioritisation of economic issues during the economic crisis. Bulgaria, the EU's poorest state has nevertheless already achieved its 2020 renewable energy targets. This achievement seems to challenge the widely held assumption that poorer countries struggle to meet environmental objectives. This paper analyses the drivers and implications of Bulgaria's renewables expansion in order to test general expectations on influential factors shaping renewable energy transitions in the context of poor states. The analysis employs the energy justice framework to identify the justice, equity and fairness implications of Bulgaria's renewable energy for its energy system. Despite the clear justice implications raised by changing energy systems, there are limited pieces analysing the relationship between renewable energy transitions and energy justice. The analysis shows that whilst Bulgaria was able to reach its renewables targets, the mismanaged, opaque and corrupted policy framework undermines the longterm viability of its energy transition. The analysis confirms the importance of long term strategies, effective policies and a supportive macroeconomic context for renewable energy transitions, and highlights the negative implications of renewables to achieve greater energy justice if these factors are omitted.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"Sustainable energy transitions are fundamental in making climate actions effective and in attaining sustainable development. To achieve the transition inclusively, fairly, and justly, democratizing these processes seems imperative; yet, not all human societies are thriving in democratic spaces. Focusing in the non-democratic state of Thailand, this paper explores the materiality of energy democracy in such locations. Using mixed qualitative methods and a grounded approach, the paper offers a case study of community-oriented renewable energy transitions as practices occurring outside the realms of state-sanctioned and government-fostered apparatuses for public engagement. The case shows how these practices continually shape and co-produce energy sociotechnical orders. The paper further shows how a space for communal deliberation can become a site for the making and remaking of public engagement, and how, over time—of hits-and-misses, of consensus-and-dissensus, of stability-and-uncertainty—it could became durable, yet remained open-ended and provisional.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"Changes to the material and social systems that underpin energy infrastructures are inextricably linked to energy justice concerns, and the timeframes of those changes significantly affect their outcomes. Temporal aspects of energy initiatives and their impacts are thus an important site for examining emergent public views on new energy proposals, inequality, and energy justice. We propose urgency is a particularly rich concept through which to study (i) the justice and socioenvironmental implications of energy systems and technological change and (ii) how people make sense of contested energy timeframes. Here, we present findings from a series of public deliberation workshops held in the United States and United Kingdom to discuss projected impacts of shale oil and gas extraction by hydraulic fracturing. We encountered critical similarities across sites, as in widespread public resistance to issue framings that foreground urgency-based claims in support of their objectives. Participants assessed energy initiatives with particular reference to temporality and urgency, and we argue these views raise justice concerns regarding distribution, the creation of environmental inequalities, public participation, and recognition. We also suggest a focus on urgency provides fresh perspectives on justice issues surrounding the speed and direction of technological development in general and of energy transitions in particular.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"To consider the impacts of economic inequality on energy consumption efficiency we need indicators that take into account the complexity of the economic and energy systems. We also need decision support tools that help incorporate such indicators into policy analysis. Drawing inspiration from urban studies and ecology, in this paper we develop a scaling indicator for income disparity in national economies that is a measure of system complexity and does not presuppose any distribution as ideal. The scaling indicator is calculated for 2010 income distribution data for countries. We show that rising disparity – measured using this indicator calculated; a) for distributions of incomes across consecutive twentieth percentiles of population in national economies and; b), for distributions of population density in census blocks in metropolitan statistical areas affects energy consumption efficiency in a diametrically different manner in cities and nation states leading to a higher urban carbon footprint while increasing energy efficiency nationally. The different nature of these two systems explains the results. We then modify tools for visualizing complexity from urban studies and ecology to explore the correlation between income disparity and energy efficiency in national economies.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"This paper presents a case study of a Swedish municipality, focusing on how local industry and local authorities, collaborating through industrial energy efficiency networks (IEENs), can increase the amount of realized energy efficient measures. The Swedish case discussed here has similarities to a German/Swiss organizational model with the purpose of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their implementation of energy efficient measures. Both models have a strong focus on knowledge creation through practice rather than on information sharing. The background, design, benefits, and drawbacks of the Swedish case model are discussed here through document studies and interviews with participants in the project. The Swedish model implies that by supporting knowledge creation in SMEs through a practice dimension, the amount of realized energy efficient measures can be increased. This model should therefore be recognized as an effective policy instrument for municipalities that are interested in supporting local industry. Another conclusion is that information sharing in networks must be complemented by the creation of situated local knowledge through practices. Finally, value, situated practical experience, trust, knowledge creation, and informal meetings are important factors that enabled the network to fully support SMEs in implementing energy efficient measures.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"Technical innovations feature prominently in the current ‘energy transition’ debate in Africa but societal adaptation issues seldom receive a thorough airing. The mediating role of ‘societal conditionings’ in the adaptation to new energy technologies and the outcomes of such energy-society interrelations can offer some important insights. A study in Ghana shows a recent enthusiasm for Solar Home Systems (SHS) as power back-ups in residential facilities due to high/convoluted tariffs, perceived corruption and inefficiencies in the state-driven/centralised provision of electricity. A new class of “energy-elites” whose livelihoods and lifestyles require uninterrupted access to electricity sought to gain some autonomy in electricity provision and consumption by investing in power storage devices (e.g. power inverters and batteries) or fuel-powered Generator-Sets for use during unexpected frequent power outages. These infrastructures supported self-organised electrification initiatives only on ad hoc basis but SHS provided avenues to sustain that societal quest for autonomy. Achieving this autonomy, nonetheless, required SHS users to restrict their practices to energy services easily enabled by SHS alone, or adjust social practices according to the extent to which they intended to depend on the state-driven provision of electricity. The vision of energy autonomy and resultant societal practices are indeed realised through the use of SHS technology; the overarching driving force is the dynamics of energy-society interrelations. We therefore hypothesize that the adaptation to decentralised solar PV systems in Africa cannot be reduced solely to technical innovations nor even financial considerations but is instead dependent on how these factors intersect with social practices, the quality of the state’s electricity services, etc. to shape societal energy visions.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"The sectoral innovation system perspective has been developed as an analytical framework to analyse and understand innovation dynamics within and across various sectors. Most of the research conducted on sectoral innovation systems has focused on an aggregate-level analysis of entire sectors. This paper argues that a disaggregated (sub-sectoral) focus is more suited to policy-oriented work on the development and diffusion of renewable energy, particularly in countries with rapidly developing energy systems and open technology choices. It focuses on size, distinguishing between small-scale (mini-grids) and large-scale (grid-connected) deployment paths in renewable energy. We explore how the development and diffusion of solar PV and wind technology evolve in these sub-sectoral systems. We find that innovation and diffusion dynamics differ more between small and large than between wind and solar. This has important analytical implications because the disaggregated perspective allows us to identify trajectories that cut across conventionally defined core technologies. This is important for ongoing discussions of electrification pathways in developing countries. We conclude the paper by distilling the implications of these findings in terms of the requirements and incentive mechanisms that shape different pathways.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"Solar PV is gaining ground in low and middle-income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where a change from donor to more market-driven investments has been observed. This article contributes to energy transition research in low-income countries, taking Rwanda as a case study and focusing on the factors that determined the implementation of what was the largest on-grid solar project, upon completion in 2014. The multi-level perspective (MLP) is used to structure our analysis of the various socio-technical levels, and their interaction, to better understand the conditions that are enabling this transition. Our analysis reveals the central importance of bureaucratic and regulatory support for investment in low-carbon energy technologies, within a political economy influenced by processes of neo-liberalisation, while creating significant space for private contract negotiation. In particular, the provision of legal and financial guarantees was crucial to reduce risk for foreign capital investment, revealing contradictory forces that both promoted market rule, while limiting private capital’s exposure to competitive pressures. We also focus our analysis on the aspect of control and driving forces, in particular the role of development partners and private sector project champions.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"Low levels of access to modern energy services in sub-Saharan Africa combined with increasing awareness of climate change have made domestic-scale sustainable energy products, such as solar lanterns and improved efficiency cookstoves, popular within international development programmes. Following the turn towards private sector approaches to deliver basic services in the global South, many organisations of different types are trying to establish market infrastructure for these energy products to reach the ‘consumers’ they are designed for. This paper examines certain socio-technical arrangements within these market systems and identifies areas where they can inadvertently reinforce inequalities along the value chain, even if consumers are finally reached. Responding to Çalişkan and Callon’s call for more research into marketisation processes and drawing on the concept of ‘market devices’, the paper identifies three market devices as case studies: warranties, carbon credit frameworks and product standardisation tools with related certification schemes. Discussion of these devices is informed by ethnographic research in Kenya, Uganda and Malawi.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"Given the growing interest in the ability of the private sector to contribute to the goal of providing universal access to energy in developing countries, this study sets out to investigate the practices and business approaches of private actors in the emerging niche of private mini-grid development in Kenya. The paper’s analytical focus is on how niche actors are influencing and creating change in the incumbent electrification regime of grid extension to strengthen and expand the niche for private mini-grids. The analysis shows that, in addition to internal niche processes like the alignment of expectations, learning and network building, niche actors actively engage in various forms of institutional work. The greatest emphasis here is on regulatory institutional work in order to influence legal and economic frameworks, but niche actors also engage in cognitive institutional work to enhance acceptance of the niche technology by constructing a shared world view between niche and regime actors. Interestingly, niche actors also engage in normative work to establish positive normative associations with the private-sector model, like equity and social justice. The research concludes that in this case institutional work is collective work drawing on different mandates and relying on different skills and resources.",Volume 42,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/42/suppl/C,8
"In this article we introduce a Special Issue of Energy Research and Social Science focused on energy infrastructure and the political economy of national development. Many countries are experiencing transformational growth in energy infrastructure, such as transmission and distribution systems; import, export and storage facilities; the development of domestic energy resources; and construction of new power generating stations based on wind, water, coal, gas and nuclear sources. Large-scale projects like these are frequently justified by appeals to grand narratives – promoting economic growth, securing energy supply, modernizing energy service provision, and transitioning to more environmentally sustainable energy systems - in which the fate of the nation is closely tied to infrastructural development. The papers in this collection present compelling empirical evidence of how claims for energy infrastructure’s national significance and/or necessity intersect with the (re)production of political and economic power. Drawing on case material from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe, they highlight the capacity of different energy technologies and infrastructural assemblages to shape political and economic outcomes beyond their role in storing, transporting or transforming energy. This Introduction to the Special Issue does three things. First, it characterises the scale and significance of the contemporary ‘infrastructural moment’, observing how, in many national contexts, energy policy-making remains centralised and divorced from public participation. Second, it critically differentiates existing literature on the political economy of energy infrastructure to identify five distinctive ways in which research understands the ‘political work’ infrastructure performs. Third, it introduces the papers in the Special Issue and organises them into four key themes. Overall, the Introduction affirms the importance for social science of understanding the economically and politically constitutive power of energy infrastructures. The critical reflexivity this requires is essential to moving towards energy infrastructures that are just, equitable and sustainable.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"This paper offers a value-theoretic critique of ‘post-neoliberal’ energy production in Ecuador. The Ecuadorian government is attempting to end the dependence on finite hydrocarbon resources and unite energy infrastructure with industrial competitiveness through the transformation of the country’s ‘energy matrix’. Based on extensive field research, we argue that the project reveals the contradictions of the landlord state’s attempt to mobilise circuits of ground rent and foreign debt to create cheap energy as a comparative advantage for national industrial development. Riding high on global commodity prices and tapping into a huge stream of Chinese investment, the government massively increased investment in new sources of hydroelectricity and energy infrastructure. Whilst ostensibly bringing about a reduction in energy production costs, this has come at the price of leveraging the country’s natural resources (oil and minerals) and, paradoxically, creating an oversupply of hydroelectricity. Drawing on a Marxist reading of the landlord state and tracing the flows of ground rent, capital and energy we reveal how, far from the claims of post-neoliberal modernity, the project is in fact deepening resource dependence by channelling hydroelectricity towards the nascent Ecuadorian mining frontier.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"This article develops a critical perspective on the water-energy nexus under transformation and introduces ‘infrastructure’ as a conceptual-analytical reference point for revealing relations between water and energy and in understanding how they work. By utilizing this approach, the article focuses on the emergence of a liberalized electricity market and the launch of a hydroelectricity program under the neoliberal water and energy policies of the Turkish state. Through a case study of the hydroelectricity infrastructures in the İkizdere River Basin, the article demonstrates that the liberalized electricity market exerts implicitly ‘structural tensions’ on the hydroelectricity companies on the local level to minimize the natural variability of the river. In return, the hydroelectricity companies built infrastructures in the form of water storage and chained configurations that take the role of providing electricity to the market in a predetermined manner. Hence, they take the control of river flow and regulate it with environmental, social, economic and political consequences. This article hopes to open a door for an infrastructure-oriented direction of research addressing the social, political, economic and environmental nexus relations that are mostly hidden and unvoiced operating on the local scale, and have major implications for the environment and the livelihoods.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"Decommissioning is often understood to mark the end of an energy infrastructure, associated supply network or even an entire industry. The long-term nature of this process for large scale infrastructure offers, however, a strategic opportunity for businesses. The paper argues that pro-industry Scottish business interests have proactively reframed decommissioning oil and gas infrastructure as an investment opportunity, whereas their German counterparts in the nuclear industry have struggled to mobilize a positive reframing of the phase-out. A detailed analysis of eighteen interviews reveals critical insight into how each industry approaches mobilising support for their interests through motivational framing in the decommissioning context. Four key differences between the case studies (materiality, industry trajectories, rise of small business and national political identity) are then identified and reflected upon.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"This article identifies problematic tendencies in current analyses of the Middle East’s energy relations. All social relations are frequently seen as determined by resource extraction, use and transfer, contributing to the uniquely instable social relations of the Middle East. Social structures despite being energy rich, are seen as incapable to react to old and new geopolitical crises and the effects of global climate change, adding to a picture of chronic underdevelopment and conflict. This article offers an alternative, more optimistic perspective on the Middle East’s energy relations. Privileging the social over the material, calorific, geological or topographic dimensions of energy relations, it argues that social life developed in relation to its natural resources, matter and energy, but is not singularly determined by it. It proposes to historicise and re-politicise the Middle East’s social energy relations, including its nutritional and geopolitical dimensions. Emphasising their dynamic character, energy and its associated infrastructures are subsequently re-defined into political categories, a field of social contestation and change, rather than a limiting biophysical structure. The concept of Social Energy, thus, transforms nature from a constraining externality into an integral part of social analysis and transformation in the Middle East.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"Despite the rise and fall of the central role given to states in national development discussions, there is an emerging trend in Africa where several countries are harnessing their natural resources – at least in policy – for broad-based development. Particularly in the energy sector, there is the growing popularity of what is now termed ‘petro-developmental states’ who through the adoption of local content policies and laws seek to increase the participation of their nationals in the energy industry. The objective of our paper is to explore this phenomenon in Ghana, Mozambique, and Uganda by examining the specific laws and policies vis-à-vis the political will and institutional/infrastructural capacity of these countries to advance development. In identifying whether the developmental state model fits with the changing dynamics within Africa’s energy (mainly hydrocarbon) sector, the results were mixed or negative although Uganda is sometimes seen as a promising example. Overall, the paper underscores the intersectionality of energy infrastructure, institutions, political power, and national development.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"With the recent decline of renewable energy technology costs—most notably solar photovoltaics —off-grid energy systems are becoming increasingly attractive alternatives to grid extension for advancing rural electrification in Africa. However, there are institutional challenges to wider adoption of off-grid solutions. Combining a multi-level perspective with project funding data from the Kenyan and Tanzanian energy sectors, we assess the extent to which these new off-grid technologies have been incorporated into the existing energy regimes in both countries. Using a qualitative assessment of academic literature and official documents, and a quantitative assessment of energy investments, we find that although international development agencies have provided financial support for niche, off-grid companies, both global donors and the regime electricity sector operators in Kenya and Tanzania continue to favor on-grid and grid extension activities. While landscape influences on both countries are similar, we find that differences within the institutional regimes result in different development pathways for off-grid niches. In Kenya, unbundling and privatization efforts have attracted private investment in both on- and off-grid projects. Tanzania has more relaxed regulations for off-grid power producers, and a clearer regulatory framework for allowing off-grid operators to impose cost-reflective tariffs, which creates a supportive environment for niche innovation.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"To date, challenges to renewable energy transition have been discussed largely based on the cases and experiences from the Global North. In this paper, we aim at broadening our understanding of this specific socio-technical transition by incorporating the case of wind power development in China. Based on the analysis of policy and legal documents, we examine how institutions are organized and incentives are distributed among relevant stakeholders. We argue that China’s significant wind curtailment problem has been produced and exacerbated by multiple axes of institutional misalignments stemming from China’s fragmented energy bureaucracy. Through the study of the Chinese approach to renewable energy transition, our goal is to demonstrate the institutional plurality of socio-technical transition and the context specificity of its challenges.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"Following the rapid growth of wind power in Denmark in the past 20 years, energy infrastructure has become increasingly politicized. Fluctuating renewables not only contest the dominant ‘logic’ of operating the system, namely ‘supply-follows-demand’, but it also introduces new actors like aggregators and reconfigures existing market actors. In this paper, we study a case, EcoGrid 2.0 on the Danish island Bornholm, as a case of a ‘marketized’ solution to the infrastructural concerns emerging from the large share of fluctuating wind power in the system. The market design involves transforming ‘flexible consumption’ into an exchangeable good, as well as a transformation of households into ‘distributed energy resources’, making it possible to capitalize on the existing infrastructure in new ways. We end the paper with a discussion of the implications for infrastructure; when households become balancing entities and a digital and smart infrastructure is made indispensable to the operation of the system, the infrastructure grows significantly in terms of scope and complexity eventually introducing yet new challenges.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"Member states of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)) are undertaking a number of energy policy reforms to cope with challenges from low oil prices, intensifying regional conflicts, increasing domestic energy consumption and inefficient power generation. This article offers a perspective on energy policy reform and its implications for energy infrastructure in the GCC. It outlines an observed paradigm change in the rentier social contract where energy subsidies – as the key instruments of rent transfer – are been gradually replaced by a premium associated with state-provided jobs. The new paradigm allows efficient and effective distribution of rent to the growing higher-income national population while mitigating the substantial opportunity cost associated with energy subsidies. The paradigm change is being facilitated by the extension of state control from the oil sector to the non-oil energy sector. The article discusses the theoretical implications of the paradigm change and the near-term institutional setting of energy infrastructure development in the GCC.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"Multiple forms and spaces of energy are enrolled in nation-building projects. In this cross-disciplinary paper, we outline how struggles to govern the relations between climate and the human body have shaped nation-building efforts and electricity infrastructure in the settler-colonial society of Australia. Focused on Australia’s tropical zone, notably the hot, recalcitrant, militarized region of the Northern Territory, we explore how questions of climate have slowed, undone and accelerated efforts to securely settle its capital city, Darwin. In doing so, we highlight the multiple links between electricity infrastructure and air-conditioning that have made it possible to hold ‘climate’ and ‘body’ together, co-producing indoor microclimates and habitable territory while contributing to the warming climate that is now raising questions about the limits of this electricity-enabled habitability. By examining the intersecting spatialities of electricity, we help advance more ‘thoroughly geographical’ (Bridge, 2018) accounts of the relation between energy infrastructures and nation-building, highlighting the multiple forms, frontiers and feedback loops through which energy – broadly defined, as foundational category – acts as hindrance, enabler and side-effect of nation-building projects. We show how this perspective reveals troubling paradoxes and tensions, including accelerating feedbacks between energy use and climate change extending far beyond Australia’s borders.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9

"The young Republic of Kosovo sits atop the fifth largest geological lignite reserve on the planet. In the face of an unreliable electricity supply, the Government has promoted the New Kosovo Power Plant as a key project for energy security and national economic development. Efforts to add new coal-based generation capacities have sparked a debate over appropriate approaches to achieve a reliable and affordable electricity supply. Drawing on a governmentality-inspired analytics of protest, we explore how critical civil society organizations engage with and challenge the rationalities and practices that establish the New Kosovo Power Plant as a project of major national importance. We conceptualize dissent as a counter-conduct—resistance enacted in the context of ‘the conduct of conduct’. We find that critics employ different notions of energy security to promote alternative paths to governing a reliable energy system. We argue that critics simultaneously challenge and reinforce a political strategy of securitization, which constructs power plants fuelled by domestic resources as backbones of national economic development. The case helps illustrate possibilities for and constraints on enacting dissent against a project of national prestige, which are also likely to occur in comparable conflicts elsewhere.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"Neoliberal trends are a part of the sociopolitical contexts that shape present-day energy transitions. Economic arguments extensively used in nuclear energy discourses regarding the Nuclear Renaissance period may indicate that neoliberal trends have penetrated discussions about energy transitions. This article examines the presence of neoliberal rationality in the official nuclear energy discourses coming from Russia and Poland. These countries are interesting in respect to their relatively recent changes towards a market economy. Neoliberal rationality is defined in the article as the combination of market rationality, limited role of state, political consensus, governance structures and securitization, following Foucault and Brown. Discourse analysis of the energy policies and speeches of politicians that contain statements about nuclear energy development is carried out. The analysis confirms the significant presence of these themes in nuclear energy discourses as well as discourses reflecting the specificities of the two countries. The combination of the defining features of neoliberal rationality in official nuclear energy discourses seem to leave limited space for challenging nuclear energy development and discussing alternative energy transitions.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"This paper explores the socio-technical imaginaries surrounding infrastructures of coal mining and coal combustion in Poland. Contemporary policy makers in Poland mobilise a national imaginary inherited from communist times – encapsulated in the slogan ‘Poland stands on coal’ – that fuses infrastructures of coal extraction and combustion with the fate of the nation. This socio-technical imaginary provides support for coal futures, even in the face of contradictory evidence for domestic resource depletion, poor regional air quality, and global climate change. To examine this process, the paper brings research on socio-technical imaginaries into conversation with work on resource materialities. It highlights how certain materialities of coal (abundance, accessibility, energy density, location) were integral to the emergence of a national socio-technical imaginary of modernisation via coal; and how other materialities (declining resource quality, effects of emissions on respiratory health, coal as CO2-in-waiting) now collide with the political strategies of a government determined to reassert ‘black gold’ as a bedrock of national development for years to come. The paper considers how contemporary political efforts to rehabilitate coal and secure its future in Poland draw selectively upon a socio-technical imaginary of coal-fuelled national modernisation.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"Turkish energy infrastructures have recently gone through an unprecedented expansion. The country’s energy production capacity more than doubled in a decade; the Turkish energy market became one of the world’s fastest growing by attracting USD 50 billion between 2008–2015. This aggressive growth was met with opposition in the countryside, setting in motion an encounter between capital and society along energy infrastructures and land-use disputes, bestowing state a new role of brokerage along with new legal tools and authorities. In order to better understand this encounter, I first examine the fragmentary neoliberalization of the energy sector over the past three decades and highlight the uneven, variegated, piecemeal and conjunctural nature of its outcomes. Then I discuss, through the notion of energopolitics, the role of energy in enabling an authoritarian mode of power, which can help us to think through the arrival of a post-neoliberal future.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"Analyzing Japan’s situation, this study examines how shifts in national government prioritization of infrastructure for large baseload electricity sources influence the political power of entities responsible for maintaining and expanding this infrastructure. Applying two theoretical frameworks – the theory on co-evolution of technological systems and institutions, and the advocacy coalition framework – the study shows how infrastructure prioritization leads to economic vested interests and political power that combine to shape energy system trajectories in complex ways that can enable both stasis and change after external shocks. Findings generate insights on how shifts in electricity infrastructure priorities and utility empowerment affect economic considerations for energy systems. Findings also provide lessons for policymakers on how linkages between infrastructure prioritization and political power can promote energy system lock-in. The study suggests that energy system adaptability requires framing of energy system goals in ways that enable necessary infrastructure investment while creating flexibility that allows future infrastructure changes.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"Energy poverty remains an enduring challenge in Bangladesh, with 41 million people lacking electricity. Foreign states, corporations, and financial institutions have historically shaped the form and terms of the country’s energy system, which is predominantly fossil fuel based. Shifting geographies of energy extraction and processing continue to reflect this past and influence current national energy debates in Bangladesh. The Rampal coal-fired energy project, a joint initiative with India, exemplifies these tensions. Opposition to the Rampal plant, proposed in the ecologically sensitive Sundarbans region, and other controversial energy extraction and processing projects led some activists and impacted stakeholders to promote the idea of “our energy, our rights.” The articulation of an energy rights discourse asserts that Bangladesh should extract and control national energy resources in a manner that respects rights and provides the basis for analyzing the energy justice landscape in the nation and beyond. The rights discourse rejects the nation’s legacy of poor energy decisions, and the associated realities of energy poverty. Contributing to emerging ideas around the geographies of energy justice, this research paper explores the practical application by activists and stakeholders of rights discourses to contested energy projects in Bangladesh. It shows how distributional energy justice activism critiques the historical political economy of economic liberalization and energy exploitation in the country and centers the rights concerns of energy poverty while also considering climate change vulnerabilities.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"We employ infrastructuring as a verb to highlight contested processes of infrastructure expansion to extract, store, transport, and transform natural gas (into liquefied natural gas, LNG). As faculty members and students embedded in mid-Atlantic universities in the United States (US), we conducted participatory action research to record nearby infrastructuring for Dominion Energy’s Cove Point LNG Export Terminal and Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We documented how frontline and impacted populations seized opportunities when infrastructuring was visible to challenge and erode the excessive economic and political power of Dominion, one of the US’s largest energy providers, who sought to maintain regulatory privilege through lobbying, campaign contributions, and delegitimization of public health and environmental risks. Extending Tsing’s concept of frictions (i.e., engagement in difference-based encounters), we highlight (1) coalition-building among unlikely allies (collective encounters), and (2) conflictive interactions between proand anti-gas stakeholders (oppositional encounters). Impacted populations collaborated with proximate and distant allies to publicize and legally challenge distributional, regulatory, racial and other forms of injustice from gas infrastructuring. Our critical energy justice (CEJ) framework helps to identity and defend interconnected components of justice under threat due to profit-oriented global gas infrastructuring based upon reckless disregard for climate science and public health.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"This paper examines the impacts of land acquisition for a gas processing plant at Atuabo on the livelihood of affected farmers. The paper explores the extent to which affected farmers participated in the determination of compensation paid out to them and whether and how the compensation package adequately caters for the lost livelihoods. Using the livelihood approach as a guiding theoretical tool and data produced through interviews, observation, cases studies, and informal discussions, the study found that farmers' involvement in the compensation process did not go beyond identification and measurement of their farms. With limited participation in the acquisition and compensation process, the farmers felt deprived of their entitlements and viewed the compensation as inadequate for their lost livelihoods and generational inheritance. It is recommended that the government actively engage with community members and traditional authorities to ensure that farmers are allocated new parcels of land for cultivation.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"This paper investigates from a socio-technical and energy justice perspective the lack of coordination of international, national and local developmental priorities and inclusion of local needs in the decision making process of large dam construction in the global South. The paper argues that the analysis of energy infrastructures as socio-technical systems requires an energy justice approach to capture the true environmental and social nature of energy production and consumption. In doing so, this paper proposes a conceptual framework called “The Energy Justice Framework for Dam Decision-Making” as a tool to inform energy decisions on infrastructure development based on energy justice principles and social impact assessment. The proposed framework is used in this paper to analyse distributional, procedural, restorative justice, and power relations throughout the entire dams’ energy system in the case of four large dams located in Africa and Asia, namely Kamchay dam in Cambodia, Bakun dam in Malaysia, Bui dam in Ghana and the planned Zamfara dam in Nigeria.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"Greenhouse-gas-emission-reductions to prevent dangerous levels of climate change require a global transition away from fossil-fuel energies. Sustainability transitions of such scale present a major redistribution process, and pose severe challenges to national policy-making. While power and politics have recently been addressed by scholars of sustainability transition, the role of labour as a central political actor is still underexplored. This article aims to close this gap by engaging theories from Comparative Political Economy, asking: How does labour power influence energy transitions? Specifically, we introduce power resources theory to Kuzemko et al.’s (2016) “forces for continuity” of fossil-fuel regimes and “forces for sustainable change”. We illustrate the resulting framework with the case of the German electricity transition. Our findings include a) the potential of organised labour to tip the scales in energy transition politics towards continuity or change, b) the relevance of unions’ political access and their internal homogeneity of interests as power resources, c) the aspect of potential changes in unions’ positions over time, and d) avenues for labour in green sectors to gain power resources by organising in small but homogeneous organisations, and/or by prevailing in the internal power struggles of larger but heterogeneous organisations.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"Reimagining energy infrastructures for the 21st century increasingly means choosing between competing economic futures, a dilemma that is now provoking conflicts across many places and realms. In the United States, one critical clash is unfolding among tech sector advocates for a clean energy transition, as U.S. cleantech has worked to regroup from Silicon Valley’s failed clean energy manufacturing push of the late 2000s and to navigate an ongoing solar trade war with China: about what that transition might look like, how it might be achieved, and, critically, what economic sectors and rents might emerge from it. One set of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists argues that “breakthrough” clean energy technologies are needed to produce an energy transition and to bolster U.S. economic power into the 21st century. Meanwhile, a competing set prioritizes deploying existing technologies and infrastructures at scale. The latter argues that new kinds of innovation can accomplish this task, and in the process defend embattled U.S. hegemony: notably, so-called financial innovation, and new articulations between finance and high tech. This debate has major implications for the nature and global politics of a green economy.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"Since 2015, the Indonesian solar electricity sector has witnessed unprecedented attention from international investors and developers, with planned solar photovoltaic (PV) projects announced in 2017 set to increase existing installed capacity from 9 megawatts (MW) to over 240 MW. This article examines the emerging geographies of renewable energy generation resulting from the rapid influx of foreign investment into Indonesia’s solar PV sector. While foreign investment may prove successful in increasing the country’s solar PV capacity, it may also produce several contradictory outcomes for Indonesia’s energy transition. Efforts to reconcile demands of risk-averse, profit-driven investors and developers with the needs of the approximately 25 million Indonesians who currently lack access to electricity has resulted in a geography of renewable energy generation characterized by large-scale centralized generation facilities that constrain opportunities for local ownership and control over the energy system. The result – a major contradiction when viewed through the lens of Indonesia’s energy transition development objectives – is not only a flow of economic benefits out of the country and limited improvement in energy access for much of the country, but a missed opportunity in terms of maximizing the socially and politically transformative potential a broader energy transition may entail.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"In 2014, China announced an ambitious plan to help alleviate rural poverty through deploying distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in poor areas. The solar energy for poverty alleviation programme (SEPAP) aims to add over 10 GW capacity and benefit more than 2 million households from around 35,000 villages across the country by 2020. This article investigates the implications of the initiative through discourse analysis of policy documents and a case study of its implementation in the remote and largely pastoralist county of Guinan, in Qinghai province on the Tibetan plateau. The study illustrates the constraints on implementing SEPAP and contested local perspectives on the buildout of ostensibly low carbon infrastructure for electricity generation. In particular, it raises new perspectives on the limits of a state-led push for energy infrastructure in rural and underdeveloped areas, without proper incentive mechanisms for local bureaucrats and non-state actors, or independent oversight of a “top-down” policy implementation process.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"The development of universal electricity networks remains a challenge for public authorities and energy utilities in many African cities characterized by rapid urbanization and high poverty levels. This article looks beyond the technicalities of recent electrification programs to explore the politics of introducing new socio-technical rules and practices in unplanned settlements. Our empirical study investigates the implementation of the Kenya Slum Electrification Project in Kibera, one of the most deprived areas of Nairobi, and the regularization of electricity services promoted under the scheme. Approached through a political perspective at a local micro-scale, attempts to control and regulate electricity supply and use in the slum appear to be highly conflictual and reveal considerable power struggles over this marginalized territory. The analysis confronts the socio-technical strategies of the Kenya Power and Lighting Company with the everyday tactics and resistance of subaltern actors. It allows for an in-depth understanding of electricity networks as political terrains and conflict zones, and as junctions that mediate particular socio-spatial relations. Based on our exploratory study on the negotiations surrounding the project and the circumventions by slum dwellers we suggest perspectives for addressing the local politics of slum electrification and malfunctions in their design.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"This article explores the emergence of public controversies around the development of a new technological zone and its associated energy infrastructure. It focuses on the moment when Niger became a new oil producer in 2011, and traces its historical genesis, to show how new oil-related infrastructures were contested in a series of socio-technical disputes. These controversies centered on connecting, counting and knowing oil and were produced, at least in part, by the standardizing effects of the oil industry and its role in the formation of a technological zone. The way the disputes unfolded opens up an epistemic window onto larger questions related to the oil industry in Niger. Going beyond the resource curse and rentier state models’ focus on rentseeking and greed, I argue that disputes over the oil infrastructure in Niger reveal what is at the heart of everyday politics and society at the moment of entering the oil-age, namely local content and participation. I identify three common strategies adopted by host countries to gain a foothold in the oil industry and to achieve national development: resource control, sector links, and indigenization. Analyzing these strategies allows us to gain a nuanced understanding of resource politics and standardization in Africa.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9
"The growth and development of solar energy, which is so important in the current global context, is determined by political economic factors, and in turn, has varied implications for energy justice. India’s western region presents a complex context within which to examine why these trajectories unfold in particular ways and to what end. This article first situates India’s renewable energy policy within the dynamics of its federal politics. It then focusses on the trajectory of renewable energy development in two Western Indian states, Rajasthan and Gujarat, highlighting how regional particularities and path dependence have shaped the emergence of solar energy, often in ways that run counter to both expected and hoped for results. The idea of energy justice is subsequently introduced as a way to evaluate whether solar energy infrastructural growth in its present form is best serving the multi-pronged needs of climate justice, economic development, and social equity. By combining a political economy of renewable energy that accounts for the political and institutional factors conditioning the growth of solar capacity with the normative arguments embedded in the energy justice literature, this study contributes to a growing understanding of the intersection of solar power and development.","Volume 41, Pages 1-278 (July 2018)",July 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/41/suppl/C,9

In the global South, knowledge is far less developed regarding reasons for opposition to wind power. Physical and economic marginalization of affected people, whose lands may be appropriated for wind farms, from the positive benefits of renewable power is thought to motivate opposition. We analyze results of pilot research on the planning and licensing process and mitigation policies responding to negative impacts of a wind farm in Ceará state, Brazil.

Our framework of three inter-locked subsystems – Localization, Affordability, and Saturation – explains how localization, affordability, and saturation emerge from a structure of feedback mechanisms and interact to drive adoption and sustained use of solar PV systems in resource poor communities.

"The primary social challenge of offshore wind power development may be local community members’ struggle to come to terms with the transformation of the ocean. In this study of local residents’ perceptions of the first wind power project off the North American coast, we consider whether factors such as aesthetics and place attachment, dependency and identity might serve as barriers or gateways toward an offshore wind power future. Respondents are 420 coastal Rhode Island and Block Island residents who were randomly sampled by mail or internet prior to turbine installation and after project commissioning. Data were analysed using weighted descriptive statistics and multiple imputed regression analysis. 87% of respondents who live in census tracts bordering the coast support or lean toward supporting the project despite paying significantly above-market prices for the electricity generated. Regression models show that support for the project is influenced, at least in part, by general disposition toward wind power and whether a respondent likes the turbines’ appearance, with place-related measures having less influence. Descriptions of the wind turbines that resonated with supporters and opponents include respectively, “Symbolic of progress towards clean energy” and “Cause the loss of something intangible, where all you see is the ocean”.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"Wood fuel remains the most widely used domestic fuel amongst resource poor groups in many low-income countries, despite the environmental and health problems associated with exposure to wood smoke. Studies on household air pollution concentrate predominately on socio-economic and behavioural factors and health with little emphasis on socio-cultural factors. The study contributes to the understanding of household air pollution (HAP) and wood fuel harvesting for domestic activities in low-income countries from a cultural perspective that draws on householders’ wood fuel selection and cooking practices in Ado Ekiti, Nigeria. In this paper, we explore how cultural norms influence households’ cooking practices, energy choices and perceptions of the causes of ill health and misfortune. The research draws on household surveys, participant observation and semi-structured interviews with householders of four different ethnic origins in nineteen villages. Key findings reveal low levels of awareness of HAP-related illness coupled with high levels of attachment to traditional biomass-fuelled cooking systems for a range of cultural and pragmatic reasons.

"Energy consumption statistics for countries of the Global North and South support the idea that an increasing standard of living and level of technology is coupled with a rise in per capita energy consumption. What might be true on a national level looks different at the household level. In a first step, we compared the household energy consumption of Kenya, Germany and Spain with the result that the energy used per capita in households in Kenya (0.31 toe pc) is estimated to be even higher than in Spain (0.16 toe pc) or Germany (0.23 toe pc), if energy for heating is disregarded. The same is true for the household CO2 emissions in the three countries. The use of firewood or charcoal as main cooking fuel is the main driver for the overall household consumption in Kenya; our result is therefore transferable to a number of countries where firewood and charcoal consumption is at a comparably high level.

"Against the background of a global energy transition, resource-rich Russia embarked on renewable energy policies (REPs). Having set a renewable goal of 4.5% in the electricity mix (2009), Russia’s government introduced support schemes on the wholesale (2013) and retail (2015) electricity markets. This raises the question of how Russia’s elite explain this rollout of REPs, as a global shift towards renewables may threaten hydrocarbon exports. Common drivers – security of supply and ecological considerations – seem unconvincing given Russia’s substantial fossil fuel reserves and limited implementation of international climate change agreements.Building on a self-compiled database of 395 Russian texts dealing with renewable energy, this article maps Russia’s elite discourse through argument comparison between actors, audiences and over time. By doing so it critically assesses resource-geographic, financial, institutional and ecological enabling and constraining factors.The article concludes that the main elite arguments for REPs are as an attempt to avert the green menace by establishing a Russia-based RE industry.

Based on model studies conducted by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), we present socioeconomic and environmental criteria to question whether such projects are mutually beneficial or constitute an asymmetrical exploitation of solar resources. Furthermore, we analyse the risks discussed in the literature about the MSP and Desertec, and identify that they are actually European misrepresentations of Middle East and North African (MENA) countries with negative implications for Concentrating Solar Power investments in the region. Finally, we present a conceptual definition of “institutional orientalism”, arguing that such distorted perceptions of risks are rooted in historical imbalances of power.

"This paper examines the impact of environmental regulations on the stock price of listed fossil based energy companies in China. Based on the event study methodology, we found that environmental regulations have a variety of impacts on the stock prices of China’s listed fossil based energy companies. While legislative regulation has negative impacts on the stock prices, both environmental information disclosure (EID) and administrative regulation have positive impacts, and the impacts of market-based regulations (MBR) are firstly positive, then become negative. Further, the negative impacts of legislative regulation and the positive impacts of EID are the greatest. These results suggest that close attention should be paid to EID by policy makers. Moreover, we found that the impacts on firms vary depending on their nationalization level and scale. A surprising finding is that the negative impacts of environmental regulations are greater on listed fossil based energy companies with higher level of EID than on those with lower level of EID, which poses a challenge for policy makers in designing EID policies.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"Improvements in energy efficiency and reductions in energy demand are expected to contribute more than half of the reduction in global carbon emissions over the next few decades. These unprecedented reductions require transformations in the systems that provide energy services. However, the dominant analytical perspectives, grounded in neoclassical economics and social psychology, focus upon marginal changes and provide only limited guidance on how such transformations may occur and how they can be shaped. We argue that a socio-technical transitions perspective is more suited to address the complexity of the challenges involved. This perspective understands energy services as being provided through large-scale, capital intensive and long-lived infrastructures that co-evolve with technologies, institutions, skills, knowledge and behaviours to create broader ‘sociotechnical systems’.

"The aviation and livestock agriculture sectors are major producers of greenhouse gas emissions, and have been the subject of extensive examination to develop lower impact, more energy and resource efficient technologies. Yet little attention has been paid to the challenges faced in the adoption of these lower impact technologies in these industry sectors. In this paper we seek to understand the interactions between technological innovation and socio-behavioural contexts in the adoption of more environmentally sustainable practices. Focusing on the UK (although recognising the global context of aviation and agriculture) and using a combination of literature analysis and interview data we undertake a detailed examination of these interactions. We examine why the claims of eco-modernisation theory that argue that the drive for economic efficiency will lead also to improved energy and resource efficiency appear unfounded in our cases. We identify lock-in in both sectors, finding that the barriers to greener innovation hinge particularly on the knowledge practices that pertain in the two sectors. This ‘epistemic lock-in’, rather than simple inertia and resistance to unfamiliarity, appears crucial, and must be overcome to enable adoption of lower impact technologies.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"The most critical question for climate research is no longer about the problem, but about how to facilitate the transformative changes necessary to avoid catastrophic climate-induced change. Addressing this question, however, will require massive upscaling of research that can rapidly enhance learning about transformations. Ten essentials for guiding action-oriented transformation and energy research are therefore presented, framed in relation to second-order science. They include: (1) Focus on transformations to low-carbon, resilient living; (2) Focus on solution processes; (3) Focus on ‘how to’ practical knowledge; (4) Approach research as occurring from within the system being intervened; (5) Work with normative aspects; (6) Seek to transcend current thinking; (7) Take a multi-faceted approach to understand and shape change; (8) Acknowledge the value of alternative roles of researchers; (9) Encourage second-order experimentation; and (10) Be reflexive. Joint application of the essentials would create highly adaptive, reflexive, collaborative and impact-oriented research able to enhance capacity to respond to the climate challenge. At present, however, the practice of such approaches is limited and constrained by dominance of other approaches. For wider transformations to low carbon living and energy systems to occur, transformations will therefore also be needed in the way in which knowledge is produced and used.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"This study develops research on social movements, political coalitions, and sustainability transitions with a multi-coalition perspective. The perspective begins with a typology of coalitions based on two pairs of goals—general societal change versus the sociotechnical transition of an industry or technological system, and sunrising versus sunsetting of systems and structures. Mapping the diversity of energy-transition coalitions makes it possible not only to identify the various wings of a broader industrial transition movement in a specified time and place but also to show the dynamics of how coalitions interact and change over time. Drawing on case studies of four energy-transition coalitions in New York State that approximate the four ideal types, the study shows differences in the goals, strategies, organizational composition, and frames of the coalitions. The study then shows the mechanisms that enable integration across coalitions, including the role of bridge brokers and new frames. As the networks of the energy-transition coalitions become more connected, the organizations make use of a wider set of frames, including the newer frame of energy democracy. Thus, the study develops an approach to the study of energy democracy that shows how it can serve as a frame that bridge brokers use to integrate coalitions.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"Greenhouse gas emissions are stagnating in Germany despite increasing deployment of renewable energy. This makes the government’s Energiewende appear inconsistent and has triggered a discussion on phasing-out coal. The focus has thus turned from niche technology development to the destabilization of the existing high-carbon regime. In this paper we investigate stakeholders’ framings and their perceptions of different policy options to advance the understanding of regime destabilization processes and theory-building in the context of the multi-level perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions.We find that actors still form coalitions with traditional allies and cling to established lines of reasoning, although there are indications for a beginning disintegration of the status quo-defending coalition. In their framings, core actors emphasize risks and threats. This confirms that regime destabilization is particularly conflictual and shows that for actors pushing regime change it is more difficult to offer a positive story. Linking policies for phasing-out incumbent technologies to accompanying measures for managing structural change in affected regions may facilitate compromise. The results moreover point to a tension between national and supra-national action as a core issue in destabilization debates.

Using case studies of two energy access projects in India, this paper demonstrates that these claims, while true in part, are neither simple nor straightforward. It argues that pre-existing socio-cultural processes mediate the development outcomes of energy access projects. In particular, the roles of gender, socio-economic positions and the local economy are vital in understanding the links between education, livelihoods, health and energy.This paper is important for two reasons. First, working with culture as a mediator, it provides nuanced insights into relationships between energy access and three key development goals. Second, by presenting this analysis, the paper identifies a need for further research on the relationships between socio-cultural processes, development and energy access and, how by keeping these processes in mind, the benefits of energy access could be extended to less privileged social groups. This paper is based on a nine-month long ethnographic research in five villages in India’s Bihar state. Home tours, interviews, participant observations and group discussions were used to collect the data.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"Energy poverty is an alarming problem affecting nearly half of the global population who rely on solid fuels for cooking. Numerous interventions are in operation aiming to reduce the number of affected people, yet many have not achieved the desired level of change. This paper offers a novel perspective to conceptualise inertia towards entirely abandoning solid fuels. We explain that cooking with solid fuels is a traditional practice, and, using the Capability Approach, we argue that this practice, which is influenced by persistent social arrangements, could constrain people’s capabilities to pursue a flourishing life. It is also argued, applying a practice lens, that the perpetuation of the practice is a product of human agency dominated by established knowledge and other social practices. We postulate that inertia that is holding people from giving up solid fuels is formed around people's perpetual tendency to take recursive actions and refrain from performing new acions, guided by firmly rooted social structure. The paper argues that replacing solid fuels cannot be achieved only by simply giving access to modern fuels and stoves. Instead, it is imperative to understand the social context within which the reproduction of social practices takes place in order to break the structural resistance and enable transformation.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"Energy poverty is a major societal issue with both economic impacts and solidarity implications. Although its main drivers (e.g. insufficient income, bad quality housing, high energy prices) are widely recognised, there is no common definition of energy poverty at the European level, let alone a common way of measuring the phenomenon. The energy poverty barometer for Belgium has been developed accordingly. It draws on a set of complementary indicators with the aim of grasping the multifaceted nature of energy poverty: excessive energy bills compared to available income (measured energy poverty), restriction in energy consumption below basic needs (hidden energy poverty) and self-reported difficulties to heat the housing correctly (perceived energy poverty). This paper presents and discusses the methodology followed to design this new tool in the Belgian context and its main findings.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"Energy innovation is essential for tackling climate change. However, an established set of indicators, that can support policy makers in their design of policy mixes, has not been developed for evaluating the performance of energy innovation systems. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to list and classify a large set of indicators of the performance of energy innovation systems at sectoral and technological levels. 120 listed indicators are evaluated using four usefulness criteria, demonstrating significant weaknesses in the available indicators. The indicators are also classified according to an innovation process categorization to see if they cover all aspects of an innovation system along the entire innovation chain. In order to illustrate their application, the Nordic countries are selected for an analysis at the sectoral level, demonstrating a variety in the dynamics of energy innovation systems among these countries. At the level of an individual technology, we show how 90 indicators match the seven functions in a technological innovation system and how they, therefore, can guide policy by helping to analyze the strength of each function. Policy making may be further supported by an understanding of the dynamic relations between different indicators. Finally, recommendations for further research are given.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"This paper explores how men and women’s roles in society are reflected in the way they use and perceive energy in Kenya. Drawing on qualitative data collected from 75 in-depth interviews with energy users around Kenya it suggests that there is a disconnect between the people who benefit from modern energy technologies in a household setting, and the people who purchase them. Gendered roles mean that men do not spend much time in the house; however they often make major purchasing decisions for the household as a result of traditional gender power divisions. The dominant economic position of men leads to a situation in which men do not believe they benefit greatly from modern household energy technologies, but are needed to purchase these very services in order to facilitate increased access to them. For people designing and implementing energy access programs in Kenya and beyond, this represents a significant challenge, and one that is especially pertinent today given the increased popularity of market based models for the dissemination of energy technologies.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"Scenarios are a key instrument to guide decision-making in the face of an uncertain future. In the field of energy, scenarios are often published to inform external stakeholders who are not part of the scenario development. This study explores how researchers, a key stakeholder group in shaping the energy future, use energy scenarios. It analyses the case of Switzerland, where several competing scenarios have been developed in reaction to the governmental decision to phase-out nuclear power. 16 structured in-depth interviews with researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds were conducted. While most interviewees use public energy scenarios, there are two contrasting user types. The first group, labelled divers, primarily uses scenarios as a data source, whereas the other group, the sailors, refers to them as plausible energy futures. We identified different interpretations of scenario content between sailors and divers, which result from the quantitative modelling on which contemporary energy scenarios are based. Due to a lack of guidance from modellers and missing qualitative information, energy scenarios are prone to misconceptions and distortions in their interpretation by external users.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"Electrification is increasingly proposed as a solution to the problem of Africa’s development. International organizations hope to light ‘a dark continent’, converting solar panels and global investment into jobs and thereby aiding Africa’s emergence into the global economy. Such straightforward expectations, however, are at odds with longstanding research in Science and Technology Studies (STS) and on-the-ground realities. This article examines the proposed energy transition in Senegal, drawing on over eight months of ethnographic observation at three sites: an energy conference in Dakar; the National Ecovillage Agency (ANEV), a body implementing the national energy project; and an energy development NGO designing alternative solutions for Africa’s poor. Using the STS concept of sociotechnical imaginaries, this article highlights two visions of the transition: an internationalist discourse in which technologies like solar panels, supported by foreign aid, are expected to transform society; and a locally embedded approach in which social conditions determine desirable futures, assisted by technology. The former is shown to create dependence on the universalist imaginaries of the industrial world, while the latter is reduced to a scramble for development projects and funding. Africa’s emergence, I argue, requires greater attentiveness to social and political institution building than to kW-hours and foreign dollars.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"Whilst the rapid spread of solar photovoltaics (PV) across Africa has already transformed millions of lives, it has yet to have an impact on the main energy need of poor households: cooking. In the context of falling global PV prices, recent advancements in battery technology and rising charcoal/fuelwood prices in severely deforested regions, the door is opening for a potentially transformative alternative – solar electric cooking (PV-eCook). While initial investigations focused on solar home systems sized for cooking (cooking device, battery storage, charge controller and PV array), it has since been shown that battery-supported electric cooking (eCook) can also strengthen national, mini, micro and nano grids. This paper presents a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) based methodology, accounting for a wide variety of socio-cultural, political, technical and economic factors which are expected to affect the uptake and potential impact of eCook across a variety of African contexts. It shows the concept has considerable viability in many African countries, that there are significant sizeable markets (millions of potential users), and that within the next five years the anticipated costs of eCook are highly competitive against existing ‘commercialised polluting fuels’.",Volume 40,June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/40/suppl/C,10
"Many transnational energy companies are engaged in the exploration and development of oil reserves in the Arctic, and are facing policy challenges in respect to benefit sharing with the local communities. Benefit sharing arrangements between oil and natural gas companies and indigenous communities were investigated in Nenets and Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Districts, Irkutsk and Sakhalin regions in Russia and the North Slope of Alaska. We argue that Indigenous communities are not equally benefitting from oil and gas extraction, and no one benefit sharing policy model seems to ensure a sustainable local development. This may stem from the mismatch between benefit sharing policies and local institutional frameworks. Thus, as a part of benefit sharing obligations, companies and the state must work with Indigenous peoples and other affected communities to build local capacities and human capital. There is an urgent need to improve our knowledge base about benefit sharing in the Arctic energy sector, and we urge the Arctic Council Sustainable Development Working Group and/or the Arctic Economic Council to conduct a synthesis study aiming at finding best practices, identifying lessons learned, and initiating an inclusive, multi-stakeholder process of developing guidelines for companies on benefit-sharing in the Arctic.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11

"Sociotechnical imaginaries emerged in the last decade as a potentially fruitful approach to understanding how collective social values inflect on the production of scientific knowledge and the design of technological systems. Yet insights generated to date have focused on the categories experts use to define a society’s idealized organization, either as the direct subject of analysis by documentary analysis or through the ways such categories circumscribe the field of authorized “values” open for adjudication in public engagement events. We argue that sociotechnical imaginaries require a new methodological framework for designing research in order to examine the collective values of citizens as they live their daily lives, rather than focusing on experts and the state in order to understand the shared moral, material, and scientific goals of a society. Drawing inspiration from rhetoric, corpus linguistics, and dialectology, we present the Social Energy Atlas, a new and burgeoning research project that employs such methods for studying emergent narrative patterns and variation at the local level. Advancing the theory and practice of studying sociotechnical imaginaries is of tremendous benefit to Energy and Social Science researchers, and it is our intent this commentary encourages further careful development and use of the concept.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"The continuation and exacerbation of many environmental failures illustrate that environmental and climate justice’s influence on decision-making is not being systematically effective, giving rise to a renewed emphasis on finding new, more focused, justice models. This includes the energy justice concept, which has received ready and growing success. Yet for energy justice, a key question keeps arising: what does it add that environmental and climate justice cannot? To answer this question this perspective outlines the origins, successes and failures of the environmental and climate justice concepts, with a view to both distinguishing the energy justice field, and providing cautionary tales for it. It then outlines three points of departure, which it argues increases the opportunity of success for the energy justice concept: (1) “bounding out”, (2) non-anti-establishment pasts and (3) methodological strength.

"No Canadian province has fewer regulations surrounding the controversial practice of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) than Saskatchewan. Other provinces – and some US jurisdictions and foreign countries – have banned fracking or chosen to heavily regulate it because of its environmental and public health risks. Saskatchewan has lax regulations and a political regime that favors the oil and gas industry. This paper asks where environmental non-government organizations (ENGOs) are in the landscape of public opposition to fracking. Previous research has shown the rural communities can be dependent on natural resource extraction for revenue and jobs thereby leaving citizens unwilling to speak out against the industry or the government policy that surrounds it. Through surveys and interviews with ENGOs in Saskatchewan we find these organizations are not engaged in fracking debates or policy at all. No ENGO in the province is lobbying for regulatory changes and no ENGO is presently working to disseminate information on fracking to the public or government. This suggests, in line with earlier work, that Saskatchewan will remain the wild west of Canadian fracking, while the public and the environment may pay a significant cost.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"World market fuel prices vary and have historically been very difficult to predict. Especially the price of oil has shown remarkable and unexpected increases and decreases throughout the past 5 decades. The same kind of uncertainty can be seen in many of the new cross-border markets for the trade of electricity, which have been introduced in recent decades. These uncertainties pose a challenge to the design and assessment of future energy strategies and investments, especially in the economic assessment of renewable energy versus business-as-usual scenarios based on fossil fuels. From a methodological point of view, the typical way of handling this challenge has been to predict future prices as accurately as possible and then conduct a sensitivity analysis. This paper includes a historical analysis of such predictions, leading to the conclusion that they are almost always wrong. Not only are they wrong in their prediction of price levels, but also in the sense that they always seem to predict a smooth growth or decrease. This paper introduces a new method and reports the results of applying it on the case of energy scenarios for Denmark. The method implies the expectation of fluctuating fuel and external electricity prices.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"The European Commission envisages smart home technology (SHT) as reducing energy costs and simplifying consumer engagement in a low-carbon-energy retail market without inconveniencing them. With consumers’ consent, SHT allows continuous seamless interaction between the home and the smart grid, offering the grid ongoing demand flexibility resources for reshaping the demand curve. This study assesses perceptions of a nontechnophobic segment of the Israeli public (N = 554) regarding demand flexibility and energy management through SHT. Sociodemographic variables, personality traits, and attitudes toward smart homes and demand flexibility through SHT were examined as predictors of consumers’ interest in adopting a smart home and in demand flexibility through SHT. In a hierarchical linear regression model, gender, income, openness to experience, and positive and negative attitudes toward SHT explained 64.4% of the variance in interest in smart homes. Age, openness to experience, a positive attitude toward smart homes, and perceived benefits of demand flexibility explained 31.4% of the variance in interest in demand flexibility through SHT. Regarding respondents’ willingness to allow SHT to manage appliances, dishwashers scored the highest and refrigerators, the lowest. Findings indicate that prospective adopters value the perceived benefits of comfort and convenience over risks associated with smart home technology.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"The Trondheim Living Lab is a detached single-family zero emission building (ZEB) that is planned to reach a zero-emission balance over the course of its estimated 60-year lifetime. This is achieved by a broad variety of technical strategies such as passive and active energy design and efficient installations, as well as calculations of embodied emissions. In qualitative experiments conducted between September 2015 and April 2016 six different groups lived in the house for 25 days each. Based on direct observation (mainly through sensors registering temperature, humidity, CO2 levels and energy use), participant observation and interviews before, during and after the stay, the paper analyses the unfolding domestication of the building along three dimensions; practical, symbolic and cognitive. The paper provides an account of which expected or unexpected occupant actions matter in which way for the zero emission ambitions of the building.

"This paper examines the practices advised by health authorities and performed by parents to cool infants during hot weather. The aim is to explore how health and energy efficiency imperatives can be better integrated for households. Consumption of home air conditioning is increasing around the world alongside policy concerns about energy poverty, climate change and peak demand. This paper analyses online sources containing advice to parents about temperature, hot weather and infant health. The content of this ‘know-what’ for parents was considered alongside experience-based ‘know-how’ (Royston, 2014) as described by parents in 44 interviews and home tours in Australia. Air conditioning is frequently positioned by health authorities as superior to low or no energy practices. However, understandings of infant care during hot weather are diverse and unsettled − both amongst parents and authorities. The absence of health sector consensus leaves space for energy policymakers to engage with the health sector to develop integrated cross-sectoral policy approaches. Continued circulation of adaptive, less energy-intensive hot weather practices is needed. Arresting the trajectory towards widespread reliance on air conditioning can help household finances, reduce electricity demand during hot weather, and avoid leaving parents ill-equipped when high demand or unexpected events compromise electricity supply.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"The number of consumers producing electricity at home, i.e., “prosumers”, is rapidly increasing in many European countries. This article analyses the electricity consumption and energy-saving behaviours of households that own photovoltaic (PV) systems in Sweden. Earlier studies of how home production of electricity affects consumption patterns are few and their results are mixed. We interviewed prosumers in Sweden and collected electricity-consumption data one year before and after they installed PVs. The differences between households were large and no general behavioural change could be detected. The interviews indicated that awareness of the energy system increased among all prosumers, but led to no substantial changes in how or when activities were performed. Most prosumers thought that the benefits of shifting their electricity load to other times were too small. The changes prosumers did make mostly concerned smaller adjustments. Households that increased their consumption justified this by their access to “free” electricity.

"To look at energy consumption through a different lens, we have developed the conceptual framework of habitual practices. The objective of the present paper is to propose an empirical application of this framework, with the aim of unravelling the constitutive ‘ingredients’ of energy-consuming practices. Therefore, we investigate whether discussing the relationship of people with their homes could help circumventing the methodological difficulties that inevitably arise when trying to approach less tangible (albeit crucial) elements such as norms and attached meanings. The empirical material comes from group conversations where participants discussed the extent to which a home has to be practical, comfortable and convivial in connection with a series of elements. The results confirm that this methodological setting generated useful insights for a finer understanding of energy-consuming practices and their underlying drivers. A related crucial finding is the role of key appliances – those with more contrasted use and attached meanings – which appear to mediate the interplay between comfort, conviviality, and practicality. A promising avenue for future research would thus be to further investigate the role of those key appliances as potential markers of wider tendencies in energy consumption and useful for designing segmentation strategies.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"Eco-feedback is information about resource (energy, water, food) consumption provided back to consumer(s) with the goal of promoting more sustainable behavior. Effective eco-feedback relies upon an understanding of key eco-feedback design dimensions and how they relate to behavior change. This paper develops a conceptual framework that includes a typology of eco-feedback design dimensions and maps those dimensions on to the behavioral mechanisms of attention, learning, and motivation. To develop this framework, we synthesized, clarified, and expanded on previous discussions of eco-feedback design dimensions across multiple academic disciplines. Our analysis yielded three types of behaviorally-relevant eco-feedback design dimensions: information, timing, and display. Information dimensions include granularity, metrics, valence, and contextual information. Timing dimensions include latency, strategic timing, and frequency and duration. Display dimensions include medium, modality, style, location, audience, and response requirement. Each of these dimensions has implications for eco-feedback salience, precision, or meaning, qualities that correspond to the behavioral mechanisms of attention, motivation, and learning, respectively.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"This paper explores the interlinkages between energy demand and food-related routines, to understand how routines that benefit energy demand management throughout the food system might be encouraged. Building on existing social science research, focus group data are used to examine the routines of people in three work-life situations; working parents, city dwellers, and empty nesters. A critical space in which to examine aspects of everyday life that entrench everyday routines is created by examining peoples’ feelings about their present routines and their aspirations for change. The resulting discussions illustrate the role of social and temporal commitments in shaping food routines, and how the different modes of provision, meals and methods of cooking used to navigate these commitments influence what is purchased and eaten. These aspects of everyday life therefore contribute to reinforcing and replicating patterns of energy use throughout the food system. The following discussions develop these initial findings to explore how interventions might support individual experimentation with alternative shopping, cooking and eating practices, and in so doing influence the ongoing evolution of food-related routines to the benefit of energy demand management.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"A shift to advanced cookstoves can bring significant health and environmental benefits, but only with proper and consistent use. Despite this, the empirical evidence of what drives the initial purchase, and in particular, the continued use of advance cooking technologies remains limited. This paper describes two case studies in peri-urban Kiambu County (Kenya) and urban Lusaka (Zambia) where we examine the factors influencing the purchase and use of clean biomass cookstoves over time. We apply service design methodology to build “user journeys” to illustrate the cook’s experience with the technology, from the point of hearing about it, to purchasing it, learning to use it, and making it part of their daily routine. We find that often, the primary factors influencing initial purchase do not motivate people to use the stove regularly in the longer term. From the user-journey mapping, we identify some key behaviour change techniques that could be applied, primarily by cookstove implementers, at different phases in the adoption journey to support users in the process of overcoming behavioural barriers to adopting a new technology. Our findings emphasize that complex factors affect people's decision-making around the purchase and use of clean cookstoves, and highlight the need to carefully map user’s experience to pinpoint where support is most needed in the process of change.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"Adoption of smart energy technologies, such as electric vehicles (EVs), can significantly reduce fossil energy use, provided that adopters of an EV also use the EV in a sustainable way. Hence, it is key to understand which factors affect the likelihood that the adoption of EVs promotes the sustainable use of EVs, and promote consistent sustainable energy behaviours. We argue that the motivation to adopt an EV plays a key role in this respect. When people adopt an EV for environmental reasons, this will signal that they are a pro-environmental person, thereby strengthening environmental self-identity and promoting consistent sustainable energy behaviours. We conducted two cross-sectional studies among EV adopters to test our reasoning. As expected, the more people adopted an EV for environmental reasons, the stronger their environmental self-identity, in turn increasing the likelihood that they engaged in other sustainable energy behaviours. In contrast, adopting an EV for financial or technological reasons was not consistently related to environmental self-identity and sustainable energy behaviours. These results suggest that the motivation for adopting an EV is crucial for the likelihood that people engage in sustainable energy behaviour consistently, which is key to realise a sustainable energy transition.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) suggests that while early economic development leads to increased pollution, further economic growth results in reduced environmental degradation. Many studies have sought to learn whether carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions follow such an inverted-U path, with a variety of mixed results. We use economic growth, population growth, urbanization, and energy use variables along with rarely used measures of political and economic freedom to see how they influence carbon emissions and the scope of any potential EKC. We compare a sampling of 22 OECD countries with a selection of 87 non-OECD countries, with the non-OECD countries divided up into the subcategories of free, not free, partially free, and transition. We use an upgraded dataset from the World Bank Development Indicators and the improved econometric technique Arellano-Bover/Blundell-Bond Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator to better evaluate the interactions between these variables and CO2 emissions. We find no evidence of a CO2 EKC for the OECD and non-OECD regions, and mixed results for the impact of political and economic freedom, depending on region. CO2 emissions instead tend to increase monotonically with a rising income, suggesting governments and industry need to do more to curb those emissions as development grows.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"Current Political Science approaches to the role of energy and fossil fuels in international relations are overwhelmingly based on two widely disseminated, but unhelpful practices: the artificial subsuming of other fossil fuels to oil, and the perception of energy power as state-centered influence. The issue of the differences between various fossil fuels has not been dealt with explicitly, yet it has key implications for the way in which energy is translated into power. On the basis of a structured comparison between the three most commonly used fossil fuels — oil, natural gas and coal — this article compares their key physical characteristics in order to understand how these affect secondary features (such as those having to do with and transportability, obstructability, size and location of typical markets, type of processing required, cartel possibilities, and substitutability), all of which affect relationships between actors and the ability to use energy as means of constitutive and relational power.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11

"The electric sector has undergone a remarkable transition over the past several decades, witnessing dramatic changes in the range of technologies used to provide power to consumers, the diversity of actors that have a stake in the sector, and the regulatory institutions that structure governance. In this paper, we argue that the centralized, formal, quasi-judicial regulatory approach traditionally used to regulate utilities among U.S. states is ill-suited to manage the emergent transition toward increased use of distributed resources such as demand-side management. Indeed, as the use of distributed resources has grown, states have begun to develop formal and informal ways to meaningfully engage market participants and other stakeholders in regulatory decision making. We call this trend “distributed governance,” embodying the idea that the new paradigm for electricity regulation is no longer centralized, but rather is distributed among state, market, and civic participants. In this paper, we examine distributed governance within the context of U.S. states’ demand-side management policies and programs. Using regulatory documents from Public Utility Commissions across the U.S., interviews with electric sector stakeholders in two states, and literature from public policy and management scholars, we develop propositions about distributed governance for distributed resources in the electric sector.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11

However, recent experience of such CEM regions as Güssing shows the need of holistic assessment of the transition process, including elements of participatory governance such as existing possibilities for inhabitants to engage into decision-making processes regarding energy transition in their community. The results of this paper are based on case studies of three CEMs: Freistadt, Ebreichsdorf and Baden.

"Within the current global challenges, energy plays a key role for the achievement of basic human needs, socio-economic development, environmental protection and global security. At the light of this interconnection, a proper impact evaluation metric able to assess the main effects of energy projects at local level becomes necessary in order to highlight successful strategies. Relying on the Sustainable Livelihoods concept, this study proposes an Impact Evaluation Framework (IEF) to measure project impact as changes of target community’s livelihoods. First, the IEF establishes a Capitals-Based Evaluation Hierarchy, taking its rationale from the literature: this first step responds to the needs of providing a standard and harmonized structure applicable to different projects. Secondly, the IEF develops a further Five-Step Procedure to respond to the concurrent need of flexibility and customization of specific projects. The conceptual methodology of the IEF might be used at different stages of project design: as a supportive methodology donors use in their programme of funds allocation or as an instrument experts use to quantitatively support their ex-post project evaluation. In the paper, the IEF is presented in the light of this second application and the procedure applied to a real project in Ethiopia. The set of information obtained with the IEF is compared to the final expert evaluation, commissioned by the donor and performed at the end of the project, showing the usefulness of IEF as a supportive methodology in the evaluation process.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"Rural mini-grids are viewed as a key technology for providing access to electricity to the billion or more people that lack it by 2030 (in line with the UN’s Sustainable Energy for All commitment). But at present no model for the sustainable management of rural mini-grids exists, which contributes to high failure rates. This paper makes a number of contributions. First, it explores how electricity in mini-grids might be understood as a Common Pool Resource (CPR), opening up potential to learn from the extensive literature on institutional characteristics of sustainable CPR management in the natural resource management literature. Second, it refines Agrawal’s (2001) overarching framework of enabling conditions for sustainable CPR management institutions to develop a framework applicable to rural mini-grid management in developing countries. Thirdly, the utility of this refined framework is demonstrated by applying it to analyse data from 27 semi-structured interviews with actors with expertise in mini-grid development and management in Kenya and 2 field visits to rural mini-grids there. This contributes a nuanced basis for future application of CPR theory to mini-grids and a systematic analysis of institutional challenges and possible solutions, which have hitherto received limited attention in the energy and development literature.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"Increasingly, there are calls for the owners of photovoltaic (PV) systems to pay additional charges on the basis that they are not contributing their fair share to network revenue. Air conditioners (A/Cs) are even more widespread than distributed PV systems, and their use has increased demand peaks and the size of networks required to meet them, the cost of which is typically recovered from all customers. There appears to be limited analysis in the literature regarding the impacts of A/C and PV on the electricity bills of customers who do not have these technologies. While the impacts of renewable energy on centralised electricity generation have been explored in the literature, this paper proposes a methodology to estimate the financial impacts of PV and A/C that flow through network operators to other customers. The analysis indicates that, in the datasets used, A/C systems have most likely resulted in significant bill increases for customers who don’t have them. In contrast, PV systems have most likely had a minimal financial impact on customers who do not have them. While these analyses were undertaken using Australian data, the method is applicable to most countries with modifications to suit the local regulatory environment.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"Many people agree on the need for energy system change, and that innovation is a pivotal component in attaining these changes. For this reason, a flurry of activity exists – by scholars, policy makers and practitioners – about how to realize these changes most effectively. Emerging concepts and activities underway on the ground point to systemic changes afoot. By contrast, policy makers and their advisors often rely on outdated assumptions when espousing advice about policy, investment and markets.Through an examination of a number of sustainable energy experiences, this paper argues that conventional ways of approaching innovation are inadequate at effectively understanding innovation systems; by doing so, we miss important sources of innovation. This is important because to realize these transitions further alignment between these scholars, policy makers and practitioners is required. We must look beyond frontier technologies, experts and money by taking a broad view of innovation that also attempts to capture less orthodox innovation sources. To do so we must apply a comprehensive approach to energy system change; one that acknowledges that aspects such as culture, social, environmental, and political issues can play as important roles in understanding change as economic and technical aspects.",Volume 39,May 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/39/suppl/C,11
"With this paper, I want to raise attention to the value of social conflict in energy policy and planning, and the limitations of participatory processes for including different normative appraisals in energy policy and planning. I first discuss three perspectives on the value of social conflict. Although invited participation is generally considered as a way to ameliorate, or anticipate social conflict on energy projects, this ‘participatory reflex’ goes past the fact that social conflict can itself be considered a form of participation, i.e. self-organized participation. Second, I discuss two basic characteristics of social conflict that show the limitations of invited participation in identifying and including divergent normative appraisals: 1) social conflict challenges institutions, and 2) social conflict involves emergent positions and groups. I propose to see social conflict as self-organized participation that serves as an source for identification and inclusion of normative appraisals in energy policy and planning. This not only necessitates the study of these phenomena as such, but also suggests a different approach to deal with such phenomena in research and practice. I will lay out three directions for further research.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"Since natural gas emits less carbon than does coal per unit of electricity generation, some analysts suggest natural gas will help to mitigate climate change. However, sociological research has found that the substitution of one natural resource for another often does not happen as anticipated because of political and economic factors. Here, we analyze cross-national time-series data to examine the connection between growth in emissions from natural gas consumption and changes in emissions from coal use, controlling for several structural factors. We find that CO2 emissions from natural gas sources do not displace CO2 emissions from coal. These results cast doubt on whether the growing use of natural gas is likely to help substantially reduce CO2 emissions.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12

"Which can more quickly displace fossil-fueled electricity generation—nuclear power or modern renewables? Contrary to a persistent myth based on erroneous methods, global data show that renewable electricity adds output and saves carbon faster than nuclear power does or ever has. However, some literature asserts the contrary, based on a peculiar per-capita metric—perhaps useful for comparing countries but not technologies —applied to selected countries while ignoring others with the opposite outcome. Further flaws include cherrypicked and incomplete data, restrictive redefinitions, inconsistent comparisons, and omitted institutional lead times and dry-hole risks. Careful dissection of the reasons for contradictory results (even within the same paper) from absolute and per-capita metrics of growth in carbon-free electricity generation reveals the need for care in calculating and assessing claims about which technologies can and do deploy most quickly.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"Can history and historical thinking help us to strategize key transition challenges ahead?Most transition thinkers make use of historical perspectives, sometimes obliquely, to frame their energy and society research. Yet, specific socio-historical forces driving accelerated energy use, climate warming, biodiversity loss and systemic inequities are often left to speak for themselves; summoned, there they hover, ghost-like and haunting this transition thinker.In particular, we give wide berth to questions of historiography; that is, different theories and disputes over the interpretation of historical change. In this discussion piece, I introduce four perspectives on the history and theory of long-term structural social change and argue how they could advance our transition work: environmental history, historicizing the Anthropocene, history from below, and plural time.My intent is to encourage greater engagement with historical thinking as a form of knowledge about transitions, as we work towards accelerating alternative, low carbon and just futures.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"The solar photovoltaic (PV) installation industry comprises thousands of firms around the world who collectively installed nearly 200 million panels in 2015. Spatial analysis of the emerging industry has received considerable attention from the literature, especially on the demand side concerning peer effects and adopter clustering. However this research area does not include similarly sophisticated spatial analysis on the supply side of the installation industry. The lack of understanding of the spatial structure of the PV installation industry leaves PV market research to rely on jurisdictional lines, such as counties, to define geographic PV markets. We develop an approach that uses the spatial distribution of installers’ activity to define geographic boundaries for PV markets. Our method is useful for PV market research and applicable in the contexts of other industries. We use our approach to demonstrate that the PV industry in the United States is spatially heterogeneous. Despite the emergence of some national-scale PV installers, installers are largely local and installer communities are unique from one region to the next. The social implications of the spatial heterogeneity of the emerging PV industry involve improving understanding of issues such as market power, industry consolidation, and how much choice potential adopters have.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"Germany is planning a 4GW electricity grid superhighway (EGS) called Suedlink to bring wind power from the north to the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, via a large under-used distribution hub near Schweinfurt, in Lower Franconia. Strong local objections to this project were investigated in an empirical study in the affected regions of Lower Franconia using document research, semi-structured interviews and public event attendance. Much existing literature on acceptance of EGSs problematizes local objectors as barriers to necessary progress, but several recent studies frame objectors as important participants in socially and technologically advantageous governance. Using a grounded theory approach, this study found intense concern that Suedlink, by terminating in Lower Franconia, would compete unfairly with Lower Franconia’s own renewable electricity production, threatening the local economy and the delicate threads that maintain a Lower Franconian way of life against increasing challenges. Local actors also brought technical critique to the appropriateness of the EGS for its stated objectives and the government’s apparent claim that it would only transport renewable energy. The study’s findings support the approach of framing local actors as essential participants in energy governance who could improve planning and outcomes if more effective processes of consultation are devised.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"This paper investigates the public and professional attitudes towards an innovative energy efficient façade refurbishment system, in Mediterranean countries, including Greece, Italy and Spain. Two types of multiple choice questionnaires were developed and addressed to two different target groups: building professionals and users. The survey questionnaire was created so as to elicit information on the interviewee’s background and explore attitudes and perceptions towards the proposed system. Results signify that both potential users and professionals are generally positive towards the system’s energy performance; however, the increased cost of acquisition, maintenance issues and the replacement of natural ventilation by mechanical means consist significant constraints that induce hesitations for the users. Professionals are willing to apply a ventilated façade in a future project but the lack of the corresponding knowledge may be an important obstacle to face.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"There has been, in recent decades, a concerted effort to promote energy efficiency as a means to reduce energy consumption. The general thesis is that, ceteris paribus, an increase in energy efficiency leads to a decrease in the consumption of the good or service rendered efficient. This is in opposition to Jevons’ Paradox which states that “It is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth…” This study examines whether Jevons’ Paradox holds when all available factors that could affect consumption of an efficient good/service are controlled for. Using vehicle fuel economy as a measure of energy efficiency and vehicle miles travelled (VMT) as a measure of consumption, the study examines whether, other things being held equal, a more fuel efficient vehicle accrues greater Vehicle Miles Traveled. The findings indicate that in this case Jevons’ Paradox does hold true; a 1% increase in fuel efficiency was associated with a 1.2% increase in VMT.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"Flexibility is vital to the operation of electricity systems. It ensures that the system can keep supply and demand in balance in real time. Until recently the provision of flexibility was a fortunate by-product of thermal power generation using fossil fuels as a convenient storage medium. The rapid emergence of renewables poses a major challenge to this model. As thermal power stations are increasingly displaced with more variable renewable sources of electricity, new forms of flexibility are urgently needed. Two promising candidates for this role are energy storage and demand side response.This paper argues that in low carbon systems flexibility may at times and in certain places supersede the need for component efficiency, in order to improve overall system efficiency. We reach this conclusion after reviewing the origins of flexibility on the supply and the demand side. In both domains the concepts of material redundancy, tolerances and skills are pertinent and help our understanding of the potential for and limitations to flexibility.On the demand side new capacities may need to be developed, including skills and societal norms, if the gap between technical and realised potential is to be closed.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"Over the last decade, concerns have been raised about increases in the electricity used by information technologies, other consumer electronic devices, data centres, and to a much lesser degree, Internet distribution networks. At the same time, ‘smart’ innovations are widely anticipated to help reduce energy demand across diverse sectors of society. Yet such potential savings, as well as the increasing use of other digital services, are predicated upon continued expansion of digital infrastructures. This paper focuses on the phenomenal growth in Internet traffic, as a trend with important implications for energy demand. It outlines an agenda to better understand how data demand is changing. Drawing on findings from our own research in combination with secondary data analysis, we examine the alignment of peak demand for electricity and data. Peaks in data appear to fall later in the evening, reflecting the use of online entertainment, but this is far from fixed. Overall, the paper argues that a better understanding of how everyday practices are shifting, in concert with the provision and design of online services, could provide a basis for the policies and initiatives needed to mitigate the most problematic projections of Internet energy use.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"The luminous environment affects how office workers perceive their work setting. However, research on how the lighting commissioning process associates with psychosocial variables relevant to office settings is lacking. This case study explored the extent to which employees working on a recently retrofitted floor of an administrative office building believed they could control the new lighting system. It also measured their levels of perceived productivity and affective organizational commitment to examine correlations between these variables and levels of satisfaction with the lighting commissioning process. Satisfaction with the commissioning process did not significantly correlate with perceived productivity, controllability, affective organizational commitment, or the average number of productive work hours reported after the retrofit. However, perceived productivity significantly and positively associated with perceived controllability and affective organizational commitment. Also, controllability and affective organizational commitment both significantly correlated with the number of productive work hours perceived. Results support interdisciplinary studies emphasizing the importance of lighting controllability in improving employees’ perceived performance and satisfaction at work.

"In order to decarbonize the energy sector, there is a widespread consensus that the role of end-users in the energy system should change from passive consumption to active prosumption and engagement. This is of particular importance as an increasing number of technologies and business models are focusing on the end-users. These developments provide new opportunities for further technical and social innovation to smarter, flexible and integrated systems such as community energy systems (CESs). Through system integration and community engagement CESs assist in transition to a low-carbon energy system. Despite the high importance, there is limited knowledge on willingness of local citizens to participate in the local energy systems such as CESs as well as associated factors determining such willingness. Through a survey among 599 citizens in the Netherlands, this research analyses the impact of demographic, socio-economic, socio-institutional as well as environmental factors on willingness to participate in CESs. Factor and multi-variate regression analysis reveals that the environmental concern, renewables acceptance, energy independence, community trust, community resistance, education, energy related education and awareness about local energy initiatives are the most important factors in determining the citizens’ willingness to participate in CESs. Citizens should be empowered to take active role in steering the local energy initiatives.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"The study addresses the question of how to achieve and sustain well-functioning local service delivery in institutionally difficult contexts, characterised by low levels of generalised trust, widespread corruption and poor institutions. We study a relatively successful case of decentralized electrification in Tanzania, and the process whereby an international NGO establishes a small-scale hydropower system with a local utility to own and operate it. Building on institutional theory, we investigate how to build trust in an organization, through a strategy of credible commitment; and how free-riding problems can be handled in a local development project. The qualitative study includes 119 semistructured interviews with project staff, villagers, and local and district government, observations and document analysis. The results indicate the importance of a positive ‘history of play’, sustained over time, and keeping distance from corrupt institutions, in order to build trust. Strict enforcement of rules was decisive for handling free riding behaviours, and impartiality in enforcement for perceptions of legitimacy and trustworthiness. Deviations undermined relations of trust. The results add nuance to more generic theoretical propositions and provide insights on un/intended consequences of institutional strategies.

"Following the ‘practice turn’ in energy research, increasing attention is being paid to the practices of policy making. However, energy policy implementation remains under-researched. Using auto-ethnographic and extensive interview data, this paper provides a narrative account of ‘Sustainable Routes’: a project offering grants and advice to small business in the UK to reduce their transport-related emissions. The project exemplifies the model of Multi-Level Governance (MLG), implemented by a coalition of actors, across multiple scales.Research data is analysed using practice theory. Building on recent debates over researching large-scale phenomena, the notion of connected situationalism is used to analyse policy implementation as a bundle of practices. ‘Zooming in’ on periods of disruption following project audits, findings trace how tension and conflict arose in the relationships between actors, played out through the changing constellation of meanings, materials and competences. They highlight for example, how the reinterpretation of policy documentation led material elements such as bicycles to become associated with meanings of risk and liability, requiring a new set of competences on behalf of the carriers of practice.This empirical account demonstrates the value of practice theory for analysing multi-actor, multi-scalar research data, and indicates potential for future research on policy implementation.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"This paper studies a Danish smart grid experiment, EcoGrid EU, designed to sustain the increase of wind power in the electricity system. EcoGrid EU is designed as a real-time market, through which engineers seek to realize price responsive electricity consumers through the introduction of smart meters, variable short-term price signals and training users. Based on observations and interviews with scientist, consumers and technicians, this paper analyses the attempt to produce a new kind of electricity consumer. Drawing on social studies of markets, we argue that the project entails constructing a new form of calculative agency. We illustrate the extensive work put into the creation of a new, reconfigured electricity consumer, as well as the challenges associated with the construction of consumers willing and able to act in accordance with the EcoGrid script. On one hand, this study adds to the growing critique raised by practice scholars, most prominently, regarding technically trained system designers’ ‘reductionist’ approach to users. On the other hand, the paper argues that the social sciences must move beyond a mere identification of complexity and ‘messiness’ to provide constructive contributions to the ongoing work of designing and producing new well-functioning sociotechnical systems, including new types of ‘sustainable’ users.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"The diffusion of socio-technical systems is more complex than that of discrete products and cannot be understood solely with adoption models that have come to dominate the diffusion literature. The paper makes two contributions. First, it aims to broaden the conceptual repertoire by distinguishing two analytical families: adoption models and socio-technical theories of diffusion. We distinguish four adoption models (epidemic, rational choice, socio-psychological, increasing-returns-to-adoption) and three socio-technical models (system building, circulation/replication, societal embedding), and discuss their phenomenological characteristics and causal mechanisms. Second, the paper shows that system diffusion is a multi-dimensional process that is best understood with a modular approach that combines insights from different conceptual models. To demonstrate this second contribution and explore the temporal salience of different models, we apply them to the diffusion of Austrian biomass district heating (BMDH) systems (1979–2013). The paper ends with integrative suggestions by temporally positioning different diffusion models in a broader framework.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"This article draws on actor network theory (ANT) and assemblage to interrogate the potential future manifestation of open conflicts due to unresolved latent local socio-economic and political grievances associated with oil exploitation near fishing communities and the implications of oil-related environmental degradation on local livelihoods in the Western Region of Ghana. Drawing on network geographies, this paper argues that the impact of oil on the environment and conflict is conditioned and shaped by a ‘globalised assemblage’ – interactions between and among states, national, local and transnational actors. Bad policies and (in) actions of government and its agencies, oil companies, and local actors damage the environment and livelihoods and generate displeasure among locals. Consequently, violent conflict can later emerge in Ghana if the latent fisher-folks’ grievances remained unresolved because conflicts are not events, but they build over time through complex processes. Unresolved environment challenges compromise livelihoods and create dissatisfaction among locals and can ferment conflicts in communities near the oil fields. Thus, inadequate engagement with locals to appreciate environmental challenges and covert conflicts between locals and government/companies highlights the temporality of oil impacts, where current tensions result in a future open display of resource-infused conflicts.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"Prioritising human well-being while avoiding further damage to the planet is a key challenge in the era of climate change. This paper examines the role of energy as an intermediary between climate change and socio-economic outcomes, with the ultimate goal of identifying ways of decoupling human well-being from energy use. Building on Max-Neef’s “Human Scale Development” framework and conceptualisation of human needs, we propose a novel community-level participatory approach to identify connections between energy services on the one hand and human need satisfaction on the other. This approach then enables communities to collectively consider and propose alternative ways to provide energy services. We compare the outcomes and reflect on the process of two exploratory workshops, undertaken in an urban and a rural area in Medellín (Colombia). Our results indicate that these communities view energy services as satisfiers of human needs, with significant differences between the communities. Furthermore, our approach enables the communities to broaden the solution space of energy service provisioning possibilities, thus constituting a promising alternative to the top-down technocratic perspectives currently prevalent in research and policy. We argue that this type of bottom-up approach is necessary to address the complex sustainability challenge of living well within environmental limits.",Volume 38,April 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/38/suppl/C,12
"Since 2008, China has become the dominant force in solar cell production in the world. But what about technological development and innovation? This paper contributes to a better understanding of the accumulation process of indigenous innovation capabilities in emerging economies. It empirically analyses the case of photovoltaic (PV) technologies in China between 1988 and 2014 using patent indicators with a comprehensive definition of the entire system value chain. The contribution tracks the technological catching-up trajectory of the PV innovators in China and their collaboration networks against institutional milestones of industrial policy. Theoretically, the research draws on the concepts of innovation capabilities and technological systems. Methodologically, the paper uses patent indicators and network analysis to study patent co-application activities. The analysis shows a gap between China’s share in the global PV market and its modest share of transnational patents. However, it gives evidence for a gradual technological catching-up in the 1G cell technologies, solar panels, and electronics. This catching-up is being driven by an increasing population of Chinese patent applicants clustered in isolated communities.

"There is increasing sensitivity to the importance of gender in energy poverty literature, although there remains relatively scant analysis of energy and gender from feminist development scholars. The purpose of this article is to contribute to addressing this gap. Its aims are two-fold; firstly, it provides a brief introduction to feminist development literature, and its relevance to the field of energy poverty. Secondly, the article presents the findings of a gendered or feminist Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) of energy poverty scholarship. It is argued that, at present, energy poverty discourse in academic literature constructs problematic ‘gender myths’ of women, gender equality and its relationship with energy. In doing so, the discourse instrumentalises women and gender for particular energy interventions, and does so at the expense of gender equality outcomes.

"What are ‘disruption’ and ‘disruptive innovation’? And what relevance do they have for energy transformation? Ten critical perspectives offer ten contrasting responses to these questions. The relevance of Christensen’s canonical definition of disruptive innovation is highly contested in its applicability to energy and climate challenges, as is the usefulness of analysing discrete business models or technologies rather than socio-technical systems. Further research on disruptive innovation and energy transformation needs to tackle: (i) the social, systemic and emissions impact of widespread adoption; (ii) how to mitigate the adverse distributional consequences of disruption; (iii) the consumer appeal of ‘good enough’ products for users marginalised or excluded from mainstream markets; (iv) the role of incumbents in system transformation; and (v) the reasons for geographic variation in disruption processes currently underway.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"This perspective article considers the potential for disruptive innovations to transform the market for energy-related goods and services in line with emission reductions required for stringent mitigation. Its rationale is that consumers are a neglected constituency in societal efforts to meet climate policy objectives. First, I review Christensen’s canonical definition of disruptive innovation as low-end products offering novel sources of value to users marginalised or over-supplied by mainstream markets. Second, I apply disruptive innovation concepts to the challenge of climate change mitigation and the necessary contribution of low-carbon innovation. There are both potentials for disruptive low-carbon innovations but also problems in achieving social benefits through the consumption of private goods. Third, I set out a series of criteria for disruptive low-carbon innovations and apply these to identify sets of potential innovations relating to mobility, buildings & cities, food, and energy supply. A wide range of consumer-facing innovations offer goods or services with novel attributes currently valued only in small market niches. Fourth, I report on the findings of two workshops on disruptive low-carbon innovation involving innovators, market intermediaries, policymakers and researchers.

"For many observers we are entering an age of heightened disruption in energy systems – a ‘disruption narrative’ is now prominent and seemingly widely-shared. The energy disruption narrative often goes beyond the merely descriptive: it is also often used in a normative way, in that system disruption is seen as a necessary and welcome enabler of the shift to more sustainable and more rapidly decarbonised energy systems. While not denying that there are significant changes underway in the operation and governance of energy systems, I reflect here on the assumptions associated with the disruption narrative and its value as a guide to policy and research. I firstly review some theoretical and empirical research on disruptive innovation, consider some empirical evidence on historic energy system change, and then reflect on the value of a disruptive narrative in ‘energy futures’ research and policy. The disruption narrative is a contestable framing for researchers, across both ‘whole systems’ analysis and more specific technological and organisational level study, and is a problematic guide for policy. Researchers and policymakers should be sceptical of uniform narratives about change, and seek more balanced attention to both disruptive and continuity-based dynamics of energy system change and sustainable transitions.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13

The largest disruptive potential lies in the combination of these three innovations, i.e., in the shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEV). While shared mobility per se might not have the potential to truly disrupt the transport system it is necessary to steer electrification and automation in a more sustainable direction.

It is better understood as describing one specific mechanism of technological and industrial change that contributes to a broader framework of understanding transitions. It should also be understood as a warning and reminder: businesses, policy analysts and energy modellers alike are prone to overlook potential shifts in user demands, and the technological changes that chase and enable them.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13

If we take stock of what is possible or even likely to happen over the next decades, I conclude that we would do well to be more open-minded with respect to the nature and impact of disruption, and broaden the discourse of innovation beyond technical and business innovation.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13

In this paper, we argue that the municipal level will play a crucial role in a rapidly changing energy system and that the impact of this development can be labelled disruptive if we apply an adapted definition of the term disruptiveness that refers to system change. We illustrate this based on the example of implementing renewable district heating systems, which depend strongly on community support.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
Retrofitting cities provides major challenges for decision-makers and planners seeking to provide strategic management of urban transitions. Recognising the implications of disruptive innovations for the urban energy sector is key to understanding how transition management can be operationalised. This also requires an integrated urban foresight approach to engage with city stakeholders in exploring the construction of socio-technical urban retrofit processes across a variety of scales and domains,Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"In this perspective article, we critically explore ‘disruption’ in relation to sustainability transitions in the energy sector. Recognising significant ambiguity associated with the term, we seek to answer the question: What use has ‘disruption’ for understanding and promoting change towards low carbon energy futures? First, we outline that different understandings and dimensions of ‘system disruption’ exist with different linkages to institutional and policy change. This variety points out a need to research in more detail the particular effects of differing low-carbon innovations in terms of their disruptive consequences for whole socio-technical systems. Thus, disruption can be utilised as a useful conceptual tool for interrogating in more detail the ways in which energy systems are changing in particular contexts. Second, we reflect on the relationship between ‘green industrial policy’ and disruption. In some contexts ‘energy disruption’ has been facilitated by green industrial policy, and it would seem that the profound changes said to be on the horizon in terms of disruption are also a motivator of green industrial policy. New industrial policy can be an important way in which the negative consequences of disruptive change, such as job losses, can be managed and facilitated.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"Disruptive innovation offers significant promise regarding expedited global low-carbon transition, set against currently inadequate efforts. In order to appreciate its significance, however, disruptive low-carbon innovation must be analysed in the light of three key shifts in perspective: to an analysis of system transition and low-carbon innovation itself in terms of power/knowledge; to appraisal of the significance of digital innovation (similarly reconceptualised) and its embryonic convergence with disruptive innovation; and to a geographical focus on innovation happening not (just) in locations usually presumed as leading in hi-tech, but to developing countries and especially China. Indeed, exploring disruptive innovation in this way shows that assenting to the commonplace discourse through which Silicon Valley Tech innovation is identified as ‘disruptive’ is to conflate problem with solution. Conversely, this approach shows just how significant disruptive innovation is likely to prove to low-carbon transition, effecting a disruption of innovation itself, and thence of capitalism, from which any such transition must ultimately emerge.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"A public survey of energy users across Japan was conducted in March of 2017. It is almost one year since liberalization of the low voltage electricity market for households and small retail premises, for whom we identified an opportunity to play a positive role through their choices and participation in the energy market, which may influence the ongoing energy system restructure in Japan. The survey asked about changing to a new power provider, and about the installation of rooftop photovoltaic systems to identify the reasoning behind these choices. Additionally, future hypothetical energy scenarios were tested. The results show that a significant portion of the public make participatory decisions to gain an economic benefit, while another group appears curious about new technology, seeking information before reaching a decision in order to satisfy their curiosity. Both groups are larger than the third significant group, whose decision making is guided by environmental reasoning. The results also show that a large portion of the public are relatively conservative in their energy choices, leading to a very passive approach, while a small portion of respondents demonstrated a more active stance. These findings have ramifications for the future energy system and implications for energy policy development.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"The U.S. coal industry has experienced economic decline over the past several decades, which has resulted in a loss of mining jobs and severe economic hardship in many coal communities. Recent efforts to relax environmental regulations are ostensibly intended to help relieve this hardship and to revitalize this industry. Based on evidence gathered from focus groups and interviews conducted in U.S. coal communities, we argue that coal communities that have experienced mine closures have already begun an economic and social transition, one that is based on reshaping their culture and sense of identity, and false promises to return coal jobs can be destructive to the progress that has been made.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"This paper focuses on threatened future intrusions of energy infrastructure on rural landscapes. In recent years there has been a large outpouring of publications apparently related to “the energy landscape” and “urban energy landscape”. In the author's view this is a misleading use of the word “landscape”. Here the words “rural landscape” refer to rural and countryside, as distinct from town, as they have done in the English language for over 400 years (according to the Oxford English Dictionary).There are many reasons for concern about the future of our rural landscapes due to human initiatives, among which are scarcely constrained developments of onshore wind turbines, ground-mounted solar PV, and “modern” biomass and biofuels. Guidelines and regulations aimed at protection are frequently evaded. Those supposed to apply guidelines and regulations often fail in their duty. Areas supposed to be protected from intrusion by international, national, or local regulations are exploited. A sustainable future requires us to preserve scenic values and protect many rural landscapes. This will require much stricter limits on the location of renewable energy developments in the countryside.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"Interdisciplinary whole systems research (WSR) is attracting increasing interest as a way to address to complex societal challenges such as sustainable energy. However, WSR typically involves challenging research elements (radical disciplinary scope, integrative knowledge production and transdisciplinary design), which are seen by some as intellectually and institutionally flawed. Drawing on the interdisciplinary studies literature, this paper considers WSR strategy and practice in the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) over its first two phases (2004–14) and compares UKERC to other similar UK-based initiatives. WSR strategy and practice face a number of tensions: integration versus diversity, stability versus flexibility and independence versus engagement. The emphasis in UKERC was on integration in the first phase and diversity and flexibility in the second phase – a pattern largely imposed by funders, assessors and stakeholders, rather than by internal strategy. Though granted ambitious remits, WSR is often funded, practised and assessed in the margins of disciplinary based research systems, rather than as a distinctive research form. There is a need to better attend to the choices and trade-offs involved in WSR strategy and practice, drawing on the experiences of UKERC and other initiatives. As a guide, the paper introduces a number of interdisciplinary WSR archetypes.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"While studies show that biomass-based ‘traditional’ cookstoves adversely impact health and environment, governments and nonprofits have struggled to achieve sustained adoption of cleaner cookstoves. Most cookstove diffusion programs focus on cookstove design, process of technology introduction, or market mechanisms. While such mechanisms are important, we postulate that a socio-cultural approach will go farther in informing programs that aim to diffuse cleaner cookstoves in developing countries. With our study, we step back from problems surrounding diffusion and deconstruct cultural beliefs that drive fuelwood and cookstove use in Lug Valley of Himachal Pradesh, India. The goal of this research is to understand the degree of consensus in shared beliefs regarding fuelwood use and cookstoves. Using cultural consensus analysis, we found an agreement amongst people for using fuelwood from forests and preferences for various cookstoves. We found that fuelwood use is driven by availability, lack of alternatives, and lack of infrastructure. Household factors like seasonality, cleanliness, smoke emitted, costs, taste of food influence choice of cookstoves at a household level. Cultural domains for fuelwood and cookstoves were independent from each other, therefore a holistic diffusion program focusing on cookstoves and fuel types is needed for diffusion of sustainable energy alternatives.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"This article develops concepts of what the home is and reflects on smart home technology and the research literature on smart homes in relation to these concepts. The focus is on the aspects of smart home technologies related to energy management within the home (end-uses) and at network or grid level (system). Four aspects of a home are distinguished: a place for security and control, for activity, for relationships and continuity, and for identity and values. These aspects of home are used to discuss approaches to, and ideas of, the smart home, as reflected in the research literature. It is shown that technical and ‘prospective’ research literature focuses on aspects of security and control in the home as well as on activities, whereas research papers that are more conceptual and evaluative are more likely to include questions of relations, values and identities. The paper concludes that a broader understanding of the home in all aspects is needed when conducting research into smart homes. This can be valuable when evaluating how smart home technologies work in real homes, as well as in the more technical and prospective approaches to developing new socio-technical configurations.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"Whether China can slow the growth of emissions of greenhouse gases and ultimately reduce them has become a central question for climate mitigation. In previous research on India, we developed a theoretical framework to assess the structural characteristics of different sectors and identify which ones were most amenable to mitigation. In this article, we extend that approach to China and review the nine sectors responsible for most of the country's emissions. These include electricity (disaggregating renewables, nuclear, and coal), road transportation, four disaggregated industry sub-sectors (steel, cement, fertilizers, and oil refining), and buildings. We identify two sets of attributes, what we called political/organizational feasibility and techno-economic feasibility, that together shape the possibilities for emissions mitigation. Our central intuition is that fragmentation − on the government or market side or both − makes collective action more difficult. Cement, steel, and oil refining possess favorable characteristics on both political/organizational feasibility and techno-economic feasibility, while fertilizers and renewables pose the most difficult challenges on both dimensions. Buildings and road transport are mixed cases, where techno-economic feasibility is high while political/organizational dynamics are more challenging. Finally, coal and nuclear are mixed cases where political/organizational feasibility is high but techno-economic aspects are more challenging.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"The speed and progress of transitions towards renewable energy systems varies greatly between European member states. Among others, these differences have been attributed to the emergence of grassroots initiatives (GIs) that develop radical ideas and sustainable practices. The goal of this paper is to understand the differences in the emergence of GIs for renewable energy in relation to the institutional characteristics of Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden. We analyze the possibilities of GIs to emerge and act within three dimensions: the material-economic, the actor-institutional and discursive dimension. We conclude that conditional factors lie within the material-economic dimension in terms of the biophysical conditions, the structure of the economy, energy dependency and the energy market. Within the actor-institutional dimension, we conclude that the presence or absence of fossil fuel incumbents, such as regional utilities, strongly influence the possibilities of GIs. Within the discursive dimension, openness for alternative discourses proved to be enabling for GI-activities, as well as democratized knowledge production. In addition to these conditions of possibility, GIs can also act despite dominant institutions, albeit limited. Finally, GIs need a strong network with knowledge institutes, technology developers and political parties in order to achieve institutional change that enables GIs to flourish. Without institutional space, GIs remain subjected to the dominant power-relations, and cannot exert much influence upon the energy system.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"Self-organization has been previously coined as a concept that describes the shifting relationships between citizen groups and institutional stakeholders in various fields, including sustainability and energy transitions. Yet, little has been known about what exactly the transformative power of self-organization is. The present article discusses processes of self-organization associated with small-scale, decentralized energy projects, such as local energy initiatives. By building on prior literature on energy initiatives, self-organization, and niche-regime interaction, attention is given to the mutually reinforcing relationship between local initiatives and the institutional context in which this relationship is situated. In analyzing the relationship between the internal aspects of the initiatives and their institutional arrangements, this article suggests that the processes of self-organization facilitate socio-institutional practices that are observable not only within the initiatives but also traceable in wider institutional contexts. These socio-institutional practices are essential for a better understanding of the interface between the citizen-driven energy projects and local governance. The analysis further supports the idea that processes of self-organization, along with market-led and state-led mechanism, underpin innovative and pragmatic pathways which could enhance the energy transition towards a carbon neutral future.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"We examine the unique challenges pertaining to organizational governance and decision-making in Renewable Energy Cooperatives (REC). We find that internal governance frameworks often overrule competing external frameworks, leading to decision-making processes in the RECs that conflict with the external governance framework stipulated by law. Although results were based on a single-country (Germany) analysis of 15 different RECs, the data we gathered from 38 problem-centered interviews and 15 participant observations, when positioned within the broader context of social-political governance, reveal problems and challenges that likely pertain to all RECs. RECs have helped propel the energy transition, and now they are being challenged to integrate their sizable social capital into the broader energy system. Expertise is often called for beyond what a volunteer organization can support. This leads to strains in the democratic approach to decision-making. These strains can be analyzed using transaction cost theory. Efforts at transaction cost minimization lead to decisions being made by the internal governance framework, even though these decisions conflict with the existing governance framework stipulated by law. This perspective yields insight both for policy makers and for REC managers seeking paths to growth.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"Despite the drastic reversal of decarbonization effort by the Trump administration, the majority of U.S. states continue policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing renewable energy technology (RET) deployment. Although electrical power utilities are required and/or encouraged to comply with these policies, their executives lack direct incentives to do so. In this study, a novel incentive mechanism is evaluated for aligning utility executive compensation with such policies. First, an overview is provided on chief executive officer (CEO) pay and the GHG emissions of utilities. The relationship between GHG emissions, renewable energy diversification, and CEO pay is examined using the case study of three of the largest electric utilities in Michigan. The results show that the regulated utility market is not consistently rewarding CEOs with higher compensation for decreasing GHG emissions and that both an approach incentivizing RETs adoption and an approach encouraging GHG emissions have deficiencies. A combined approach is then analyzed that results in a compensation equation allowing for utility executives to receive incentive pay for reducing overall emissions and increasing renewable generation. The results indicate that by careful calibration of the proposed incentive equations the harmful effects of emissions can be prevented through CEO incentive pay.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"Transition pathways have attracted increasing interest as a useful analytical lens through which to capture the interlocking processes, patterns, and directions that might constitute substantial movement toward sustainability. While recent research has elaborated the political character of pathways, there is still room to further scrutinize the role of critical choices and branching points in defining diverging pathways. Contributing to the growing body of research on pathways, this study develops an approach that: (1) elaborates the dynamics that open branching points and (2) illustrates how critical choices help define the direction taken at these openings, giving rise to diverging decarbonization pathways. As part of this, the contested nature of critical choices is examined, revealing how actors struggle to shape possible trajectories. This approach is demonstrated by exploring unfolding low-carbon pathways in Canadian electricity systems, drawing lessons for the practice and theory of pathways. In particular, findings indicate that attending to branching points more explicitly exposes the implications and trade-offs embodied within choices by linking near-term decisions to long-run low-carbon configurations.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"Energy policy is beset by deep uncertainties, owing to the scale of future transitions, the long-term timescales for action, and numerous stakeholders. This paper provides insights from semi-structured interviews with 31 UK experts from government, industry, academia, and civil society. Participants were asked for their views on the major uncertainties surrounding the ability of the UK to meet its 2050 climate targets. The research reveals a range of views on the most critical uncertainties, how they can be mitigated, and how the research community can develop approaches to better support strategic decision-making. The study finds that the socio-political dimensions of uncertainty are discussed by experts almost as frequently as technological ones, but that there exist divergent perspectives on the role of government in the transition and whether or not there is a requirement for increased societal engagement. Finally, the study finds that decision-makers require a new approach to uncertainty assessment that overcomes analytical limits to existing practice, is more flexible and adaptable, and which better integrates qualitative narratives with quantitative analysis. Policy design must escape from ‘caged’ thinking concerning what can or cannot be included in models, and therefore what types of uncertainties can or cannot be explored.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"Despite each level of the multilevel perspective of sociotechnical transitions reflecting a different degree of structuration, structuration perspectives have been little used to help explain sociotechnical change and stasis. Here we show how ‘strong structuration’ can be used to theorise the role of agency in sociotechnical systems in a way that brings together psychological and sociological perspectives. Strong structuration gives weight not only to actors’ practices, but also to their experiences. Practices and structures are viewed as mutually influencing, as in Giddens’ original conception, but the role of situated, subjective experience is also explicitly acknowledged. Applying this perspective, we show how individual attitudes and beliefs in relation to a niche energy technology are influenced by experience of national economic and innovation policy environments, with in turn implications for expectations of action by self and others. The overall aim is to illustrate a framework that connects individual psychology to practice, with implications for sociotechnical structure. For this purpose we draw on case study data of European R&D stakeholder opinion of stationary hydrogen fuel cell applications for heat and power, focusing particularly on the contrasting situations of the UK, Germany and Spain.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"Economic development, technological innovation, and policy change are especially prominent factors shaping energy transitions. Therefore explaining energy transitions requires combining insights from disciplines investigating these factors. The existing literature is not consistent in identifying these disciplines nor proposing how they can be combined. We conceptualize national energy transitions as a co-evolution of three types of systems: energy flows and markets, energy technologies, and energy-related policies. The focus on the three types of systems gives rise to three perspectives on national energy transitions: techno-economic with its roots in energy systems analysis and various domains of economics; socio-technical with its roots in sociology of technology, STS, and evolutionary economics; and political with its roots in political science. We use the three perspectives as an organizing principle to propose a meta-theoretical framework for analyzing national energy transitions. Following Elinor Ostrom's approach, the proposed framework explains national energy transitions through a nested conceptual map of variables and theories. In comparison with the existing meta-theoretical literature, the three perspectives framework elevates the role of political science since policies are likely to be increasingly prominent in shaping 21st century energy transitions.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"The emerging transition to renewable energy, such as wind and solar photovoltaics, creates winners and losers in electricity markets. The political battle unfolds largely between incumbent electric utilities on the one hand and challenger firms such as independent power producers on the other. Here, we provide the first cross-national study of renewable energy ownership, based on an original dataset of fifty-nine jurisdictions in Europe and the United States. We find that independent power producers operating utility-scale generation dominate renewable energy capacity across electricity markets. Incumbent utilities and small producers of distributed generation hold substantially less capacity. Counter to expectations, this global trend is largely independent from two basic policy choices: the choice of support policy—feed-in tariffs versus renewable portfolio standards—and the choice of electricity market policy—liberalization versus regulation of power markets—only explain marginal effects on distributional outcomes. Rather, the resource potential of jurisdictions, relative technology prices, and the market effects of technological disruption likely account for the rise of medium-sized and large independent power producers as the dominant players in the transition to renewable energy. The transition to sustainable energy thus follows a substitution path, in which challenger firms prevail over incumbent utilities in renewable energy.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"How can the interests of extractive industries and indigenous communities in the Arctic be balanced through benefit sharing policies? This paper analyses how the international oil consortia of Sakhalin Energy and Exxon Neftegaz Limited (ENL) on Sakhalin Island in Russia have introduced benefit sharing through tripartite partnerships. We demonstrate that the procedural and distributional equity of benefit sharing depend on corporate policies, global standards, pressure from international financial institutions, and local social movements connected in a governance generating network. Sakhalin Energy was profoundly influenced by international financial institutions’ global rules related to environmental and indigenous people’s interests. The benefit sharing arrangement that evolved under these influences resulted in enhanced procedural equity for indigenous people, but has not prevented conflict with and within communities. In contrast, ENL was not significantly influenced by international financial institutions. Its more flexible and limited benefit sharing arrangement was shaped predominantly by global corporate policies, pressure from the regional government and the influence of Sakhalin Energy’s model. The paper closes with policy recommendations on benefit sharing arrangements between extractive industries and indigenous communities across Arctic states that could be further developed by the Arctic Council Sustainable Development Working Group.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"Despite many years of substantial government research funding, advanced bio-energy technologies in China have seen limited commercial application. Chinese policy makers are increasingly critical of academic organizations for neglecting their role in the transfer of scientific results into industrial applications. We interviewed a selection of Chinese research groups working on bio-energy technologies, and asked them to describe their efforts at commercialization. We found that they focus their research on technological pathways with commercial potential, they patent and attempt to license their technologies, they are highly involved in large scale demonstration plants, and have created a number of new firms. Industry and government may have unrealistic expectations on the maturity and scale of technologies that academia can develop, however. These findings contrast with many earlier analyses of early commercialization stages of novel technologies, which have commonly identified lacking academic entrepreneurship as a root cause in stalling development.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13
"Canada’s proposed Northern Gateway Pipeline would carry unrefined bitumen from the Alberta oil sands to the coast of British Columbia for international export. Socio-political acceptance or opposition can determine the fate of such projects, and media coverage offers insight into public discourse, including how the project is framed. We analyzed print media coverage of the project in six Canadian newspapers, including 2097 articles published from 2008 to 2014. The objectives were threefold: 1) to characterize media framing of the project using a risk/benefit framework; 2) to identify regional differences in framing between the two affected provinces; and 3) to investigate the framing of environmental risk. Our findings demonstrate that public debate is dominated by environmental risk of the project with a tendency to frame the project as a trade-off between economic benefit and environment risk. Despite a strongly regional distribution of risks and benefits, we did not find substantial differences in framing between newspapers in the two affected provinces. Finally we found that the environmental risk frame was presented predominately according to potential local impacts due to pipeline or tanker rupture. The global impacts of climate change were rarely mentioned despite the large carbon footprint of the Alberta oil sands.",Volume 37,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/37/suppl/C,13

Second, it presents an overview of this field of research with consideration of the papers included in this special issue. The argument has three parts: first, there is an analysis of the growth of relational perspectives on space and energy looking at current debates within the literature; second, there is an analysis of visual representations of different energy features to demonstrate the empirical importance of a grounded understanding of relational space; third, there is an overview of the papers in this special issue as a means to put forward a diverse research agenda in this area.

"Energy research in the social sciences has embarked on a ‘spatial adventure’ (Castán Broto and Baker, 2017). Those setting out on this journey have started from different disciplinary and theoretical locations, yet a “map” of sorts has begun to emerge. Made up of epistemological positions, conceptual vantage points and lines of enquiry, this map demarcates and structures the growing field of energy geography providing a more-or-less agreed guide to the territory. In the paper's first half I reflect on the scope and significance of the spatial turn in energy research. I describe the map now guiding much spatial research on energy, identifying core ideas around which spatially-sensitive social science energy research has come to cohere, notwithstanding its heterogeneity and internal diversity. I offer a supportive reading. In the second half, I offer a more critical reading of the adventure so far, arguing that it is unnecessarily limited in its reading of space. The full potential of a spatial perspective for social science research on energy has yet to be realised. I outline three pathways for realising some of this potential – geographies of knowledge production, differentiation and disassembly – and show how each takes energy research's spatial adventure in new directions.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"Understandings of space as not an objective surface or container but rather a set of relations that are continually made and re-made have become well established within the social sciences, yet they remain noticeably absent in how energy demand research is understood and undertaken. This is, in part, because relevant vocabularies and methodologies remain minimally developed. This paper therefore establishes a conceptual approach, vocabulary and set of methodologies that offer new opportunities for understanding the spatial deployment of energy. In doing so, it works at the intersection of energy geographies and theories of practice, engaging in particular with the concepts of place, anchors and settings from Schatzki’s site ontology. After introducing these concepts, the paper outlines how they can provide a more conceptually sophisticated understanding of the energy demand dynamics of a range of changing social practices. It then presents methodologies capable of foregrounding the relational spatialities of practice and energy demand. It argues that carefully working through how energy demand arises as a consequence of social practices, and how spatialities of practice matter for understanding energy service provisioning, helps in developing methodologies that push energy research into refreshingly unfamiliar explorations, analyses and strategies for addressing associated challenges.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"Sub-Saharan Africa is seeing an influx of international interest and investment in energy projects designed to address the energy poverty and climate agendas. Often missing from these energy initiatives is an acknowledgement that bringing about energy transitions will require more than just the creation of efficient energy markets and technological leapfrogging. This article explores how we may begin to add an historical dimension to the spatial analysis of contemporary energy systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Drawing on the seminal article by Bridge et al. (2013) on the spatial dimensions of energy transitions, on energy geographies literature and on various strands of social science research on Africa, the article examines the usefulness of a historical and spatial perspective to researching how energy systems in sub-Saharan Africa came to be the way they are today. This historical and spatial understanding of energy systems is necessary if we are to make sense of future energy transitions, yet the connections between past, present and future remain understated in current policy interventions.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"Years of civil war in Lebanon (1975–1990) resulted in considerable destruction in its towns and cities, with significant impacts on buildings and infrastructure. Notably, the electricity sector continues to suffer from power outages long after the war ended, and the country’s citizens have adopted various strategies for maintaining desired electricity services in their homes. This has given rise to informal infrastructures, such as diesel-powered generators run by commercial actors or co-owned by urban residents.This paper uses a qualitative approach to explore the multi-faceted experience of power outages in urban areas of Lebanon, the nature and practices of the resulting informal electricity services that have filled that gap, and their impact on everyday life. It argues that the different practical solutions that households have adopted in order to augment electricity provision to their homes create a differentiated experience of infrastructural services in the city, its neighbourhoods and buildings. It explores these impacts through three junctions: the network of informal electricity providers, new routines and practices of households and the objects and artefacts that constitute the energy landscape in the city. This research contributes to an understanding of relationships produced by these ‘new’ and informal infrastructures.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"Rural dwellers face a series of considerable, inter-locking challenges in the coming transition to a low-carbon society. As the highest emitters of domestic carbon per head of capita in Britain, understanding how and why rural households use energy in the ways that they do, and how this changes through time, is critical to gaining an insight into the ways in which we might reduce domestic energy demand.Although a plethora of conceptual approaches exists for enriching our understanding of the social drivers of energy use and demand, it is also important to better elucidate processes that give form to lives as lived in relational rural spaces. The article deploys complementary concepts of biography, practice and lived relational space, utilises them as part of a bespoke methodology for studying extended case narratives, and reports original analyses of more nuanced understandings of sense-making about dynamic changes in life processes and lived spaces. Insights are offered into difficult to resolve narrative tensions arising when expectations, uncertainties, aspirations and imaginaries work in a relational way to frame energy use in the present, and when socio-cultural ideals and identity-forming processes manifest in rural dwellers’ energyscapes are involved in the making of the future present.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14

Using the UK as a case study I unpack the global socio-economic and ecological inequalities inherent in the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions on a territorial basis under the international climate change framework. In so doing, I problematise questions of distribution, allocation and responsibility with regards to the pressing need to reduce global GHG emissions and the consumption that generates them. I challenge the disproportionate emphasis that energy policy places on supply as opposed to demand, as well as its overriding focus on the national scale. Consequently I argue that any low carbon transition, in addition to a technological process, is also a geographical one that will involve the reconfiguration of ""current spatial patterns of economic and social activity"" (Bridge et al., 2013:331), as well as relationships both within countries and regions and between them.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"The South African Department of Energy launched the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Program (REIPPPP) in 2011 to secure additional renewable energy generation capacity for South Africa’s national electricity grid. The procurement framework included expenditure targets to drive socio-economic (SED) and enterprise development (ED) in local communities, together with requirements related to job creation through local employment as well as local community shareholding [2]. The article explores the opportunities opened up for alternative configurations of urban energy governance given the emergence of new dispersed and decentralised socio-technical infrastructure and the accompanying place-based investments by Independent Power Producers (IPPs). What follows is first an analysis of the relationship between the spatial realities of energy transitions and the political dynamics of the urban. Thereafter the article presents an exploration of the developmental implications of the programme together with three scenarios which might contribute towards enhancing the development outcomes of the REIPPPP, integrating IPPs into local economies or building sustainable energy democracies. In this way, we try to demonstrate how the expansion of utility scale renewable energy infrastructure might catalyse the emergence of new ‘spatial imaginaries’ [12] and the possibility of building ‘new forms of collective life’ [13] in South Africa.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"The challenges of climate change and energy security, along with problems of fuel poverty and energy justice bring imperatives to create transitions in energy demand. Academic research and theory have begun to highlight the ways that government policies, strategies, and processes across wide-ranging areas of policy, from health to work and the economy, shape everyday practices with significant implications for energy demand. This brings focus on the role of governance in shaping energy demand far beyond what might traditionally be characterised as ‘energy’ policy. Situating these ideas in terms of relational geographical concepts of governance, this paper analyses qualitative interview data with actors involved in governing along with documentary material, to highlight four different ways in which non-energy related governance can have important implications for energy issues. The central contribution of the paper is to set out a distinctive analytic framework for making visible ‘non-energy’ policy impacts, which might otherwise be obscured within analysis. The article concludes reflecting on the implications of the analysis for rethinking the governance of energy demand to meet contemporary challenges.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"Recognition of the negative impacts of fuel poverty, a lack of sufficient energy services in the home, has generated considerable interest in how the phenomenon can best be measured. Subsequently, the most well-known indicators deployed in policy-making, the established 10% indicator and the recent Low Income High Cost (LIHC) indicator, have generated considerable discussion and critique. One facet of the debate that remains unexplored is the effect of a change in indicator upon the spatial distribution of fuel poverty. Using spatial analyses we interrogate sub-regional estimates of the two indicators in England, where the LIHC indicator was first conceived. Three principle findings are discussed, enhancing understanding of the geographic features of fuel poverty as understood by each indicator. Firstly, the reduction in fuel poor households has disproportionately affected areas with lower housing costs. Secondly, there is a higher prevalence of fuel poverty in urban areas. Finally, the condition is more spatially heterogeneous with fewer ‘hot-spots’ and ‘cold-spots’. As a result, each indicator captures different notions of what it means to be fuel poor, representing particular vulnerabilities, losses of wellbeing and injustices. This has implications for the targeting of limited alleviation resources and for alternative national contexts where the LIHC indicator might be deployed.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"One of the main drivers of landscape transformation has been our demand for energy. We refer to the results of such transformations as “energy landscapes”. This paper examines the definition of energy landscapes within a conceptual framework, proposes a classification of energy landscapes, and describes the key characteristics of energy landscapes that help to define an over-arching typology of origins and expressions. Our purpose is to inform scholarly discourse and practice with regard to energy policies, decision-making processes, legal frameworks and environmental designs. We exam the existing literature, provide a critical perspective using imagery from the USA and Europe, and combine the disciplinary perspectives of geography and landscape architecture. We propose three main characteristics that contribute to the development of a typology: (1) Substantive qualification: General types of energy landscapes distinguished by dominating energy source; (2) Spatial qualification: The appearance of energy landscapes, ranging from distinct spatial entities to less recognizable subsystems of the larger environment; and (3) Temporal qualification: The degree of permanence of energy landscape ranging from relatively dynamic to permanent. Addressing these and a growing number of associated questions will promote more thoughtful protection of the landscapes we inherit while paying closer attention to the relationships between ourselves and the landscapes that surround us.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"Drawing on empirical material from two Italian regions, we show how various material dimensions have affected the spatial distribution and deployment of renewable energy (RE), in particular solar and wind energy. The paper draws on an approach to the analysis of materiality originally developed in the extractive industries literature, including fossil fuels. The paper acknowledges that RE forms have significantly fewer material components compared with coal, oil and gas and the other extractive industries. Nevertheless, the deployment of RE, the process of turning renewable ‘natural resources’ into productive use as viable forms of energy through stages of energy conversion, storage, transmission and distribution has material aspects like those involved in the deployment of fossil fuels. This paper aims to show how understanding these aspects of renewable energy offers an opportunity to unpack and explain how particular RE paths come to be favoured or hampered, and yields useful insights into the spatial unevenness and variation of RE deployment at the regional level. Italy has introduced a system of renewable energy incentives and between 2010 and 2012 experienced impressive growth in the renewable energy sector. The paper shows how the significant spatial variation in renewable energy deployment in the regions of Apulia and Tuscany can be explained in terms of the influence that the material dimensions exercised in relation to renewable energy deployment processes. The paper suggests that understanding the material dimensions of renewable energy offers useful insights into how and why RE realises – and quite often fails to realise – its potential in specific forms, spaces and places.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"An increansing number of quantitative works stresses that a main driver of land use change is the on-going large scale development of renewable energies. Taking this observation seriously, the paper's aim is to investigate the critical interactions with earth forces (soil, climate, ocean, air, etc.) that ensue from the progressive dissemination and scaling up of wind power projects. It is to assess how the wind power expansion makes earth matter and if innovative earth politics emerge from these entanglements with these forces. The paper assumes that sites have a strategic role as it cannot be learned from these entanglements everywhere. To this end, it proposes to articulate Simondon's spatial approach to the emergence of technological objects (from 'intensive' to 'extensive' sites) with Latour's approach to the politics of Gaïa through the notion of 'critical zone'. Two onshore and offshore wind power cases (France and Germany) are studied. Their spatial expansion interferes with polymorphous earth intensities (e.g. strong marine currents, coastal fish highways, moving seabed, large bird migrations), and raises critical issues about the fragmentation of the ecosystems. They point out the fact that these earth forces when observed, monitored and discussed could open the way to local experiments that provide them with a new relational existence and a new political status. Drawing on these observations, the paper challenges Simondon's approach to extensive diffusion of technological objects and emphasises that intensive relational work could as well underpin the expansion of technological objects. It also expands Latour's notion of critical zone in pointing out that projects scene are related to broader large scale environments.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"Community low carbon transitions – studies of the ways in which community is used to pursue environmental aims and objectives – are closely linked to arrangements of energy production and use. Community is used as a way to pursue particular energy agendas. Yet, as is often pointed out, the trajectory of transitions imagined, the ambitiousness of the envisioned transformation, and especially the implied community invoked within this, all remain gloriously inconsistent. Within community transitions attention increasingly focuses on the tensions emerging or smoothed over as competing agendas are brought together through capacious words and concepts: for example between so-called top-down government deployed community, and so-called bottom-up emergent community action. This paper offers one way to explain and explore these tensions, where they come from and, thus, help in understanding ways in which they may be overcome. Using the case study of an attempt to target one ‘street community’s’ environmental footprint in Scotland, the paper argues for taking an explicitly geographical and spatial lens to analyse these processes. The paper uses three forms of space—perceived space, conceived space, and lived space—to outline how three distinct but overlapping communities were spatialised. The contention of the paper is that tensions in community transitions often result from different spatial imaginaries, informing one’s approach to, and ‘common sense’ understanding of, community. In reflecting on the spatial implications different forms of community produce (and are in turn produced by), the article argues for greater appreciation of the imbrication of space, community, and energy as mutually co-constitutive.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"This paper analyses the spatial and scalar dynamics of a community-based campaign called Clean Energy for Eternity (CEFE), which has successfully promoted the use of solar and wind power on the far south coast of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. In this article we deploy three different approaches to understanding the role of scale; namely locational, relational and strategic rescaling. For the past decade, multi-scalar interventions by CEFE have provided a platform for community energy generation projects, facilitated by the development of social infrastructure that engendered new ideas, interactions and potentials, engagement and participation. These interventions have transformed the region's multiple, multi-scalar geographies of community engagement, energy use and climate change. Analysing CEFE assists in thinking about the relational aspects of energy demand, supply and use, as well as the spatiality of political mobilisation. As a grassroots movement that subsequently tried to scale up and out its activities, CEFE also alerts us to the relational nature of both barriers and opportunities for any transition towards a low carbon economy. Perhaps most significantly, the example of CEFE demonstrates how existing notions of the geographies of energy in Australia can be challenged and transformed.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"This paper examines the possibilities for significant energy innovation in rural locations in developed countries. It thereby questions the dominant framing of energy experiments and ‘living labs’ as urban. We discuss findings from empirical research with a rural community on Bruny Island, Australia, where a 3-year research project (2016–19) – CONSORT – funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), is underway with approximately 35 householders trialing a new residential battery storage and photovoltaic energy system. Bruny Island has a problem of peak demand for electricity during tourist periods, and a back-up diesel generator is currently used to supply electricity during peaks. An alternative solution is being trialled through CONSORT: household-level battery storage, which can be drawn upon by the utility to supply the grid as required. In this paper we explore two energy geography issues: first, how global and national energy challenges are manifesting on Bruny Island through the CONSORT project, and, second, the ways in which the particular sociotechnical context of Bruny Island has influenced the CONSORT project, creating tensions as well as opening up opportunities for energy innovation.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"Urban China provides a unique setting to examine the urban energy transitions. Rizhao, the Chinese ‘solar city’ is known for the rapid spread and popularization of solar hot water systems since the 1990s. In this paper we seek to understand how the specific urban conditions in Rizhao have favored the adoption of solar hot water systems to the extent that we can speak of an urban energy transition towards solar energy. To do so, this paper introduces a novel framework – the Dimensions of Urban Energy Transitions (DUET) framework – building upon theoretical thinking of both transitions studies and urban studies. The Rizhao case illustrates the dimensions of the DUET framework, analyzing specially the dynamic interactions between urban development processes and energy transitions. The case of Rizhao shows that transition possibilities are continuously shaped by the ongoing conflicts and alignments between industry interests and territorial priorities.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"Long dependent upon imported fossil fuels, the islands of the Caribbean have recently been targeted by initiatives meant to hasten a shift to more renewable forms of energy. In this paper, we provide an overview of this ongoing energy transition, focusing on the experiences of Jamaica and the Eastern Caribbean. To do so, we develop the concept of the ‘island energy metabolism’ as a way to conceptualize relationships between the biophysical properties of different energy sources and the distinctive territorial, infrastructural and geopolitical characteristics of islands. We trace the development of the prevailing fossil fuel-based metabolism in the Caribbean region, and highlight some of the resulting energy dilemmas faced by island territories in the region. We then turn our attention to the ongoing renewable energy transition, focusing on the opportunities and barriers posed by islands. We highlight the role of island imaginaries in attracting international interest, and point to the ways in which island geographies can hinder the transition. Drawing on examples gleaned from fieldwork in the Caribbean, we discuss the financial, logistical and infrastructural challenges posed by the region’s fragmented sovereignty and island territoriality, and suggest how a metabolism lens can shed light on the trajectories of low-carbon transitions.","Volume 36, Pages 1-174 (February 2018)",February 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/36/suppl/C,14
"The futures of energy are cosmopolitan, dynamic, and full of contradictions. There are multiple actors and institutions with multiple aims and interests advancing the futures of energy; at the same time, these futures are envisioned differently and will, therefore, be produced and negotiated heterogeneously. This context highlights that energy futures are not free of cultural, political, and economic influence, and hence can be best-approached with cosmopolitan and plural lenses. This collection evidences plurality in terms of the disparate geographic locations, disciplinary foundations, conceptual frameworks, and methodological choices of our authors and their papers. This breadth points to the many roads of imagining the sociotechnicality of energy futures and of making these expectations real and durable. We suggest embracing plurality and reflexivity, and understanding the politics of energy futures, at the same time that we also issue a caveat on the complexity of these processes. Claiming no comprehensiveness or closure, our collective contributions should be taken as works-in-progress in the unending quest to understand, analyze, and critique the plurality of the futures of energy and the ways we imagine, navigate, and contest them.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"Persistent mismatches between problems, policy framings, and solutions point to unsettled ethical conundrums in the ways that the energy transition is being imagined at the centers of global power. First, development is too often seen as the means to achieve more sustainable futures, even though experience points to complex and uncertain relationships between prosperity and sustainability. Second, while technological change is seen as essential to the transition, less attention is paid to the fact that disparities within societies demand differentiated solutions. Third, there are few principles in place for how to effect an energy transition with due attention to social justice in an unequal world.

"This article unpacks the institutional bottlenecks and path dependency holding back energy transition in two part-desert states with a sixth of India’s land, despite potentially high scope for solar growth and a systemic move towards a sustainable profile. As heavily-indebted electricity distribution companies in Rajasthan seek to emulate thriving counterparts in Gujarat and turn to technology adoption, efficiency enhancement and loss reduction measures, this study offers an in-depth stakeholder analysis, reflecting on implications for energy futures. Based on 56 expert interviews, it pries open the political economy of distribution within energy transition in Western India, spanning concerns of various consumers and providing insights into the roles played by several institutions, from regulatory commissions to renewable energy agencies. The article adds to existing scholarship by explicating how institutional conditions promote and hold back transitions to sustainable energy futures, bookmarking stakeholders’ expectations with regard to current developments on tariffs, renewable energy growth targets and compliance, the advent of competition, and public participation. It contributes a comparative understanding of the current issues, concerns and ideologies that characterise this transforming sector at the state level, interweaving electricity distribution trajectories and regional political economic developments to explain the dynamics of change and nature of resistance.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"Electricity systems are so strongly path dependent and deeply embedded in society that vertically integrated monopolistic or oligopolistic supply are justified. However, over-incentivize for capacity investment, excess dependency on fossil fuel, inefficient supply, and lack of customized services, accountability and participation raise dissatisfaction with the prevailing system, urging system transition. Given high potential of renewable energy in breaking the lock-in and generating positive feedback effects, this paper aims to explore how niche innovators and incumbents capitalize on their resources and power to create, augment or weaken prevailing political path-dependencies and lock-in of the prevailing electricity supply system to prospect a future energy transition, taking China as a case. Main findings are: (a) renewable energy has generated feedback effects in China; (b) regime actors have capitalized on their resources and power to organize alliances to be consistent with the government policy orientation while blocking institutional reforms for energy transition; and (c) their resources and power are derived from the monopolistic or oligopolistic electricity supply system and the government price control, both of which are justified for the sake of energy security and economic stabilization.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"Nearly a decade after the Philippines began promoting renewable energy through legislation, the country has seen gains and encountered roadblocks in its transition to low carbon. This paper examines the Philippines’ experience in attempting to escape conditions of lock-in and path dependency on fossil fuels, and attempting a governed transition to low-carbon energy sources. The Philippines is a developing country with substantial economic growth aspirations, yet it is among the most vulnerable to climate change, so it has great interest in mitigating global carbon emissions. Yet, the country itself is heavily dependent on imported coal for its energy needs. In the context of its existing regulatory and techno-institutional landscape, the authors examine the Philippine experience in governing its energy transition. The paper discusses challenges in balancing the trilemma of energy security, equity, and sustainability. It then identifies some priorities for the Philippines as it attempts to move away from fossil fuel dependency and accelerate its transition towards low-carbon energy. The authors consider developments beyond the energy sector, particularly the early entry-into-force of the Paris Agreement, as a tool to favor the trilemma’s sustainability pillar. The Philippine case may provide lessons for other developing countries undergoing their own transitions.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"The futures of energy in developing countries need to be catalyzed, created, and nurtured in a process hinged towards achieving the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement. This paper looks at how Thailand produces this normative energy future. Using the STS concept of sociotechnical imaginaries and empirical evidence gathered through interviews and document analysis, this paper critically engages, describes, and compares the dominant and resistant imaginaries in the ongoing production of Thailand’s energy future. I highlight three core imaginaries and describe how they intertwine with political economy, are determined by value sets and value systems, and present either visions of continuity or transformation. The dominance and/or marginalization of an imaginary, it appears, are contingent upon issues of power and resources. This entails that the production of energy futures in Thailand and beyond would be an ongoing process intertwining with heterogeneous actors and institutions, their value systems, interests and politics. Understanding these tensions and allowing alternative imaginaries to permeate policy-setting processes would be key in delivering a coherent and effective public policy.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"Despite significant natural potential for renewable energy in Argentina and the political intention to generate 8% of electricity from renewable sources by 2017, by 2016 the share was only 1.95%. Although this aggregated picture appears unfavourable, several diverse initiatives promoting the development and application of decentralised renewable energy technologies are in place across the country. The aim of this study is to characterise those initiatives promoting decentralised renewable energy and to assess their potential role in inducing the wider transformation of the Argentinian energy system. To achieve this, we apply conceptualisations for the development of sociotechnical niches and use qualitative research techniques to characterise the sociotechnical dynamics of the decentralised renewable energy sector in Argentina. A niche in an advanced stage of development, in which lessons are systematically aggregated in networks, was identified and examples of generic lessons being used to frame new projects or programmes were also found. In addition to considering the internal niche development processes, we investigate how external factors affect the development of the niche. Finally, we suggest two possible development pathways by which the niche might exert stronger influence on the broader sustainability transformation of the Argentinian power system.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"Agro-industries have the potential to catalyse energy access and promote development. Mauritius is one of the most advanced countries in the use of waste from sugar processing (bagasse) to simultaneously generate heat and electricity (cogeneration) to feed into the grid, but developments have evolved over several decades with complex dynamics between different actors. A multi-level perspective is used in this paper to examine this process and to extract policy lessons for other countries. The analysis shows how policies influenced the development of the bagasse cogeneration niche and changes in the sugar and energy regimes over time. The formation of independent power producers, centralisation of sugar mills, the use of a complementary fuel (coal) in the off-crop season, and targeted financial incentives were important for the development of bagasse cogeneration in Mauritius. Mauritian sugar mills are at the forefront of niche technological and organisational innovations in response to recent reduction in sugar prices. The country has been able to respond to changes and manage niche innovations strategically due to the deployment of finance, technical expertise and strong governance structures which enabled the government to coordinate with industry. Therefore, local capacity and institutional context are important for managing transitions towards sustainable energy.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"Inspired by the energy democracy movement, this conceptual review critically explores relationships between concentrated or distributed renewable energy and political power. Advocates assert that because the renewable energy transition is fundamentally a political struggle, efforts to shift from fossil fuels and decarbonize societies will not prove effective without confronting and destabilizing dominant systems of energy power. The objectives of this paper include: 1) theorizing and exploring the relationships between renewable energy and political power, 2) critically assessing tensions associated with an energy democracy agenda, and 3) drawing out the implications for democratizing renewable energy development in practice. Distributed energy-politics posits that distributed energy sources and technologies enable and organize distributed political power and vice versa. Efforts are underway to find ways to re-organize distributed energy flows into aggregated and concentrated stocks of energy and other forms of political power. More democratic renewable energy futures may benefit from strengthening democratic practices and outcomes, extending democratization of energy systems across all components, stages and end uses, and sharpening positions relative to dominant pressures of capitalism and market ideology, the ideology of unlimited growth, and the modernist/industrialist agenda. Renewable energy systems offer a possibility but not a certainty for more democratic energy futures.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"This paper considers the potential significance of ‘clean energy communities’ (CECs) in the transformation of the present socio-technical regimes underlying our centralized energy systems, towards a more distributed and decentralized future. It explains the centralized, distributed, and decentralized sub-structures, embedded in current energy systems and energy markets. We analyze long-term dynamics and possible pathways of this transition, and the co-evolution of energy systems and communities, using an exploratory structure, drawing on insights from transition theories, innovation studies, and social network concepts. This includes analysis of the various forms of CECs – including virtual power plants, peer-to-peer trading, microgrids, and community-scale energy projects – emerging in a number of developed and developing jurisdictions, including Australia. This analysis suggests that low-carbon transition pathways will be varied, driven by social, technological, and organizational contexts, and shaped by institutional change processes, and interaction with the existing regime and incumbent actors. Social and technological entrepreneurs, and utilities, operating within an environment increasingly defined by energy consumers, industry groups, and policy actors, will need to be adaptable and innovative in choosing strategic directions, associated investment decisions, establishing appropriate alliances, and acquiring resources, to meet their goals in this low-carbon energy transition.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"This paper investigates the development of, and changes in, the field of community renewable energy in Denmark since it commenced in the late 1970s. The focus is on community wind projects. We use an organisational and institutional theory perspective following Fligstein and McAdam’s concept of strategic action fields. Within this framework we explore the rise, decline and revitalisation of CRE fields and respond to the research question of ‘how and why the field of CRE in Denmark changed’. Input data comprise document analysis supplemented by quantitative and qualitative data analysis. The results indicate the following: firstly, the mobilisation of CRE action is closely related to normative elements of shared identification and objectives that go beyond environmental and technology motivations. Secondly the state dependence and growth trajectory requires some additional support structures that are able to reflect the unique nature of CRE projects. Thirdly, top-down measures accompanied by local approaches ensure that the acceptance of RE can be fostered through the CRE approach.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"When a Renewable Energy (RE) power system is owned, operated or maintained by a community organisation, some of the problems associated with other rural electrification implementation models e.g. private or utility, can potentially be solved; including: lack of utility investment, barriers relating to social integration of RE technologies, lack of local maintenance capabilities, and end-user education. However, a range of challenges for community-based energy initiatives in developing countries are identified in the literature, often compromising the long-term operation of RE technologies and the sustainability of the project as a whole. Hence, questions arise around the set of community capabilities required, appropriate project design, and enabling external environment for sustainable Community RE (CRE) projects. Relatively longstanding CRE rural electrification experiences in Central America can offer useful insights on the challenges, capability requirements, and future perspectives for further deployment and governance of CRE initiatives in the developing world. In this study, a comparative analysis from case studies across Panama, Nicaragua and Costa Rica was undertaken after field investigation conducted over eight months. A cross-disciplinary method combining qualitative social research and techno-economic analysis of RE power systems was then used for data integration and sustainability assessment of selected case studies.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"Issues of societal engagement in the energy system pervade both the study and the doing of energy policy. In both realms, narratives as persuasive ‘vehicles of meaning’ help us both to make sense of society’s role in past and current energy systems, and shape these roles in future energy systems. However, our eagerness to simplify complex histories and unwritten futures means that the narratives we create are often reliant on assumptions. This has implications for the degree to which narratives can find pragmatism, and thus be valuable, to a wide range of stakeholders.Drawing both on historic accounts of societal engagement in energy systems alongside emerging discourses around future energy systems, this paper offers several points of caution for the use of narratives of engagement. In terms of historic narratives, these relate to hindsight bias, predictability, and normative positioning, the combination of which depict histories of engagement as retrospectively obvious, and falsely suggest a controllability of past events. In terms of forward-looking narratives, while optimism and ambiguity play key roles in garnering interest in visions among stakeholders, they also mean that narratives vary in their relevance, and thus value to, different stakeholders. Fundamentally, narratives must find legitimacy in the actors they purport to recruit, and must thus simultaneously attend to regulative, normative and cognitive aspects of energy system engagement.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15

The framework contains basic categories and reflections that, from a governance design perspective, are crucial for refining, shaping and creating governance arrangements, which aim at changing individual energy behavior. The framework not only serves analytical purposes but can also inform practitioners in designing real-world governance arrangements.

"The future of energy depends on present decision-making, and present decision-making depends on assumptions about future effects of energy policy. Individuals have two roles in this: In their citizen-role they have to consent to measures and support their implementation, in their consumer-role they have to adopt and implement measures in their behaviour. Our question is, how distinct these roles are with regard to how they inform individuals’ perceptions and concerns related to energy policy options. By applying the “Futures Wheel” method we explored how individuals think future energy policy measures would impact their lives (consumer-perspective). By asking them whether and for what reasons in a voting they would say “yes” or “no” to them we inquired into their assessment of these measures from a citizens' perspective. Our results show that the two roles consumer and citizen trigger different patterns of thinking. Energy policy design and decision-making should consider both. Life quality and justice are important for individuals in both roles. The “Futures Wheel” method helps uncovering assumptions about the future individuals are unaware of and is a suitable method to explore anticipated effects of energy policy options. It might be useful to facilitate societal debate about the future of energy.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"Controversial mining projects are being proposed across the U.S. in the quest for supplies of precious and rare earth elements to fuel green energy technologies, like wind turbines and electric vehicles. This new prospecting is, in part, the result of geopolitical tensions over China's export limits. While the U.S. has ample resources of rare earths, the main challenge is a lengthy permitting process that pits environmental opponents, especially native tribes, against developers who claim a ""responsible"" mining agenda. The article examines these tensions through a case study of Polymet's proposal for an open pit mine along Lake Superior in Minnesota. Over 80,000 public comments were submitted for and against the project, making it the most contested project in state history. The research is based on interviews, field visits, media reports and participant observation at siting hearings. The article synthesizes two emerging areas of energy social theory, the geologic turn in geography/anthropology and STS interests in responsible innovation, to reveal the new vulnerabilities and opportunities that are being coproduced with the new energy economy. I examine how stakeholders are making sense of mining's landscape and livelihood impacts, while addressing the need for just energy futures that balance short-term resource needs with long-term sustainability.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"By analyzing the discourses in carbon governance texts, this paper identifies visions for the built environment in carbon neutral urban futures and the storylines driving those urban imaginaries. Local authorities have begun aiming for ‘carbon neutral’ transformations, but it is not clear what kind of city will result. Different imaginaries about the futurity of energy will send cities down divergent sociotechnical paths. Using discourse analysis, this paper identifies the storylines underlying sociotechnical imaginaries of urban carbon neutrality among the 17 founding members of the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, which is a network of local governments mainly from Europe and North America pioneering deep decarbonization. This paper elaborates on five storylines in urban carbon governance texts: 1. The diverse meanings of carbon neutrality 2. The new economy of carbon control 3. The city as a laboratory 4. Technological fixes and the modern city and 5. Reframing what it means to be a ‘good’ urban citizen. The developing sociotechnical imaginary of urban carbon neutrality is structuring shifts in policy and practice. Trends include a focus on technological fixes and innovation as solutions where private capital is a fundamental partner, as well as reflexivity about the experimental nature of achieving carbon neutrality.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"Bioenergy development in the Southern United States was said to promise a future with renewable energy, energy independence, expanded wood markets, and rural development. We view this vision of wood-based bioenergy as a sociotechnical imaginary involving a future where energy and rural development needs are met using sustainably-harvested local resources. While this vision has led to bioenergy development, it has not been universally shared and counter-narratives have circulated. Local people receive multiple messages and have diverse experiences with bioenergy, which affect how they interpret the imaginary. We use cultural models to examine the extent and ways that elements of the national bioenergy imaginary occurred in everyday talk in three communities where bioenergy plants had recently been developed. We show how local people articulated, responded to, and altered the national bioenergy imaginary while simultaneously drawing on diverse experiences, values, and other important social discourses. While local people had limited opportunities to alter the national imaginary, they contested and diluted it in ways that indicated that they were not fully in support of the imaginary and the development it spurred. Ultimately, this may hinder bioenergy development.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"In 2010 an initiative was launched to realize a competitive single EU market for natural gas through the use of a future vision. This Gas Target Model (GTM) aimed to provide direction for concrete market development through regulatory structures as well as an overarching scope of what a functioning gas market would entail. This paper assesses the use and impact of such sectoral visions. We develop a framework that builds on the sociology of expectations and foresight studies and distinguish between the envisioning process, vision content, and vision use (output). The analysis follows the development of two versions of the GTM: 2011 and 2015. We find that the GTM has a contradictory nature. The vision that feeds into regulatory structures requires a stable and uniform rule set. The overarching vision requires incorporation of long-term uncertainty and adaptability. Moreover, the sectoral focus requires alignment to adjacent sectors and wider policy considerations. This makes it difficult to set boundaries, to identify relevant actors, and to ensure commitment from these actors. We conclude that the former vision was actively pursued and materialized in Framework Guidelines and Network Codes, while the latter vision is just being identified and framed.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"Energy transitions are complex transformation processes, which involve different actors and unfold in a deeply uncertain future. These features make the long-term planning of energy transitions a wicked problem. Traditional strategic planning approaches fail to address this wickedness as they have a predictive, deterministic, and reactive standpoint to future issues. Modelling approaches that are used within conventional contexts are perceived to be inadequate too. They often simplify the qualitative characteristics of transitions and cannot cope with deeply uncertain futures. More recently, new ways of qualitative participatory planning, as well as new approaches to quantitative modelling have emerged to enable policy analysis under deep uncertainty. We argue that qualitative participatory and quantitative modelling approaches can be complementary to each other in different ways. We operationalise their coupling in the form of a practical approach to be used for long-term planning of energy transitions. The suggested approach enables energy decision makers to test various policy interventions under numerous possibilities with a computational model and in a participatory process. We explain our approach with illustrative examples mostly from transitions in electricity sectors. However, our approach is applicable to different forms of energy transitions, and to the broader context of transition in any societal system, such as water and transportation.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"This paper tracks the development of climate justice discourse around leaving fossil fuels in the ground. It then looks forward to the questions of equity that calls for the decline of fossil fuel production raise. It argues, following the Lofoten Declaration for a Managed Decline of Fossil Fuel Production around the World, that global distributive justice requires rich countries, who have benefited the most from fossil fuel extraction, and who have most alternative available development pathways must lead in leaving fossil fuels in the ground. However, the paper shows that equitably managing the end of the fossil fuel era is complicated by how economic efficiency or the interests of frontline communities might at times diverge from global distributive justice. In response, the paper argues that a useful short-term strategy is to focus on how equity and economic efficiency both suggest that wealthy historically polluting countries should leave high-cost, carbon-intensive fossil fuels in the ground. Beyond that, the paper highlights how difficult questions and trade-offs emerge at points where considerations of equity and economic efficiency diverge. Such points of divergence represent a considerable challenge for advocates of an equitable decline of fossil fuel production, and are areas of significant interest for future research and advocacy.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15

Will the transition be fast enough? Will the transition be driven by 21st Century institutions and governance, or will it be stuck in the 20th Century?

"Looking back from 2050, this article is written in the form of a fictional speech reflecting on the impressive progress made by 2050 towards achieving the global goal of zero net emissions. The speaker also highlights the severe and ongoing ecological damage and human suffering caused by the failure to reduce emissions with sufficient urgency in the first quarter of the 21st Century – and the ongoing challenge of implementing the actions required to bring global temperatures back below 1.5 degrees.The speech identifies the following key drivers of the ‘great 21st century energy transition’.  i) Sustained leadership from national and sub-national governments, business, civil society and the military in ratcheting up and accelerating implementation of the Paris Agreement.  ii) The escalating frequency and severity of catastrophic climatic events.  iii) Disruptive, game changing technological innovation including in energy efficiency, renewable energy, energy storage and distribution, transport, construction and agriculture.  iv) Disruptive, game changing innovation in social, economic and political institutions and relationships including:    • increasing recognition of the importance of reducing the global consumption of goods and services;    • an ongoing shift towards more distributed and collaborative economic paradigms and systems;    • growing popular and political support for the global climate justice movement;    • radical improvements in the transparency and accountability of democratic and governance processes; and    • the mobilization of millions of citizens driving transformational change in investment flows, electoral outcomes and political choices.","Volume 35, Pages 1-232 (January 2018)",January 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/35/suppl/C,15
"The tragedy of the commons provides a powerful narrative for a class of environmental problems, and serves to frame them in a way that allows people to identify effective solution strategies. But the problem frame also rests on a set of factual and value-based assumptions, and is inappropriate to guide decision-making when these assumptions are violated. The climate change mitigation challenge – reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from the energy sector, to limit global warming to less than 1.5 or 2 °C – violates these assumptions. Climate change requires us not to reduce, but to completely prohibit greenhouse gas emissions. Before any such prohibition is feasible, it is first essential to develop a clean energy system that can meet our basic needs. The main barriers to this are not economic, but rather are associated with evolving knowledge, networks, and institutions. Framing climate change in evolutionary terms can help us to appraise policy options more effectively, and ultimate identify those that get us where we need to go.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"In 2007, the European Union (EU) set goals to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, called H2020 targets, by 2020. Following the adoption and implementation of policies related to these targets, this study surveyed 187 experts from 25 EU countries to analyse their perceptions regarding the achievement of the H2020 targets. The experts' countries are grouped in five geographical regions: Central European countries (CEC), Western European countries (WEC), South-Eastern European countries (SEEC), Nordic countries (NC), and East European countries (EEC). The survey results demonstrate a broad scepticism among those interviewed: 49% perceive that the renewable energy (RE) target will not be accomplished, 60% perceive that the EU's GHG emission policies are not sufficient to fulfil the GHG reduction target, and 85% state that the EU's energy efficiency will not succeed. The regional comparison reveals that an overwhelming majority (82–93%) from SEEC, NC, and EEC feel that consistent and sufficient incentives are necessary to meet the RE targets for biomass. Contrary to the majority opinion among WEC experts, the majority from all other regions perceive that the EU GHG policies are insufficient and that the H2020 targets will not be achieved.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"For many years, energy market design has held great promises as a solution to current energy issues; ranging from increasing international trade to emissions reduction, the securing of future electricity capacity, and increasing flexibility amid growing intermittent renewable energy resources. The emerging economic understandings of the energy infrastructure motivate conceptual and methodological innovations in the social sciences, which this paper pursues. Its first part describes recent advances in social studies of markets, which seek greater appreciation of the role of economics in the formation of markets via economic theories, instruments, and many other means. The second part focuses on emerging studies which draw on these approaches to examine energy systems including their markets, liberalisation, and sustainability. The essay brings together social studies of markets with energy and opens up important topics for understanding current energy transitions. These include how financial systems can be treated as key components of the socio-technical energy system in transition; and conversely, how the case of energy adds to the theories of social studies of markets and economics by highlighting manifold interdependencies between economics, engineering problems, existing infrastructures, and political contentions when market-based energy is at stake.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"Modelling the energy use of buildings during the planning process is a well-established practice within the construction industry today. This article studies how these models are handled in practice and the issues that arise around them. This is a case study that follows the planning process of a block of rental buildings in Sweden. With an Actor Network approach this article shows how the complexity of the energy model affects the relationships between the energy consultant and the professionals from the construction company. Since the construction company professionals do not understand the calculations behind the model, they have to trust the energy consultant’s expertise. Furthermore, the energy modelling practices create tensions when proposed architectural designs are at odds with the energy efficiency goals. Lastly, the article shows how the uncertainties connected to the model’s calculations provide an arena where personal feelings are allowed to be part of the process. From the perspective of the involved professionals, energy modelling is shown to entangle social and material relations in ways that have not previously been studied in relation to energy efficiency in the process of planning new buildings.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"National-scale polls demonstrate high levels of public support for developing renewable energy while local opposition has led to delays and cancelations of renewable energy projects around the world. What makes for robust public engagement processes to reject or site renewable energy projects? A literature review reveals numerous considerations, with complexity that impedes their application by practitioners. In this study, we conducted interviews and document analysis to assess the extent to which design principles from the analytic-deliberative process literature arose during public engagement on three New England islands adjacent to proposed offshore wind farms. In our study sites—amongst the array of criteria in the literature—good public engagement boiled down to two key themes: enabling bidirectional deliberative learning and providing community benefit. Decision processes perceived as effective occurred when (1) participants, including experts and local stakeholders, learned from each other while reconciling technical expertise with citizen values; and (2) outcomes included the provision of collaboratively negotiated community benefits. Our findings highlight that community benefits are not the same as benefits to groups of individuals. Attending to these key themes may improve the quality of interactions among communities, government authorities and developers when deciding if and where to site renewable energy infrastructure.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"The transition towards a low-carbon economy has led to a growing demand for renewable energy. However, while publics are often supportive of renewable energy they are often more critical of the infrastructure required to generate and distribute energy. Although transmission lines are necessary to carry renewable energy, they are often highly visible and frequently meet strong public opposition. This is especially true in areas with a high degree of perceived aesthetic naturalness, which are often valued landscapes for nature-based tourism. While nature-based tourism in Iceland has increased greatly, so also has energy production. There are plans for reinforcing the distribution system by building transmission lines in either existing areas or new locations, such as the relatively pristine Central Highlands. Due to tourism's economic importance, and the growing necessity for a stronger transmission system, it is imperative to identify tourists' opinions on transmission lines in natural areas. Attitudes were analysed by employing a questionnaire at seven locations where power plants are proposed. Results demonstrate that tourists are generally negative towards transmission lines, especially in the Highlands and consider them one of the least desirable infrastructures. Nevertheless, there is considerable variance between different markets, with opposition highest among domestic tourists.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"This paper, based on UK practice, sets out a series of examples of previous studies of low energy housing and housing modernisation which illustrate the main approaches to studying housing and energy issues. The four approaches exemplified are technical assessments, building oriented research, people oriented research and in-depth qualitative studies, each of which sit at different points along a spectrum running from positivism to phenomenology, with the former two examples sitting further towards the positivist end and the latter two further towards phenomenology. Through an assessment of examples of each approach, we explore the argument that qualitative and discursive research methodologies have a useful role to play, complementing more quantitative approaches in the field of domestic energy. The paper supports this view, underlines the importance of triangulation and recognises the continuing relevance of studies of building performance. It goes further, however, by questioning which of these approaches should take priority. It is concluded that open-ended qualitative research, exemplified by phenomenological and hermeneutic traditions, are better equipped to investigate the home, as experienced and, in doing so, to identify the range of factors that influence domestic energy consumption.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"Does a person’s health impact their opinions about energy sources? This article tests whether people with health problems prefer less physically harmful energy sources using data from a 2011 survey of 1382 U.S. residents. 19% of respondents reported their health as “only fair” or worse, and a smaller proportion of these people supported coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy than of respondents who had “good” or “excellent” health. The analysis finds significant differences in opinion by gender, age, and other demographic characteristics. These findings are consistent with previous U.S. studies on energy preferences. After controlling for political party, ideology, sex, age, education, race, religion, and geographical region, this article shows that people with health problems are not more likely to back renewable energy, but that they are significantly less likely to support coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. These results may be utilized by a variety of policy-oriented groups. They can help shape interest groups’ advocacy strategies, advise decisions about what communities to avoid when developing energy facilities, and guide policymakers’ attempts to initiate energy policy that will be supported by the public by increasing understanding about how energy preferences are formed.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"Carbon Dioxide Utilisation (CDU) technologies convert Carbon Dioxide (CO2) into carbon-based products. CDU technologies are viewed as a means of helping to address climate change while creating commodities that can be sold to generate financial revenue. While technical research and development into CDU options is accelerating, at present there has been little research into public acceptance of the technology. The current study presents the findings of a series of 28 exploratory interviews conducted with lay people in the United Kingdom and Germany. The results show that awareness of CDU is currently very low in both countries but that there is tentative support for the concept. This support is, however, caveated by considerations of the techno-economic feasibility of the technology and the societal consequences that might result from investment. While the thematic content of discussions was similar in both countries, where appropriate any notable differences are outlined and discussed. In addition to providing fresh insight into the emerging nature of public perceptions and acceptance of CDU, it is reasoned that the findings of this research could help to benefit the design of communication materials intended to engage lay-publics in debate about the nature and purpose of CDU technologies.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"Management research recognizes that companies’ investment decisions are driven not only by objective techno-economic models but also by emotion. Alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) investments offer an appealing context in which to study this interaction in energy source decisions, as they are influenced by a diverse set of analytical and emotional elements ranging from fuel costs to environmental values. This study examines companies’ vehicle investment decision making in Finland and focuses on the interaction between objective facts and subjective feelings along with the process of choosing the vehicles’ energy source.This article is based on an interventionist case study. Switching path analysis technique (SPAT) was used to investigate companies’ switches from conventional fuels to natural gas or biogas. This article contributes to the discussion of AFV adoption by unveiling companies’ decision-making triggers, investment criteria and the use of information sources in the decision-making processes. The findings regarding the decision-making dynamics between these factors are transferable to other energy investments.

"This research seeks to address the gap in studies of energy consumption in developing countries from a social science perspective. The research uses Social Practice Theory (SPT) to gain better understanding of homeowners’ practices and resulting electricity demand in middle-class households in Pakistan, with broader implications for other developing countries with similar climatic and socio-material contexts. Drawing on the works of Bourdieu (1984, 1997), Schatzki (2011) and Shove and Pantzar (2005), the study aims to unravel the connection between familiar domestic practices and the ‘uncanny’ electricity demand. Material and social constructs of ‘homely’ household practices related to comfort, lighting, cleanliness, cooking and ICT were studied in ten middle-class households in Lahore, Pakistan. The material arrays of the intermittent electricity provision system, modernistic prefigurations of spaces preferred by the middle-class and electrical appliances play an intrinsic role in shaping, and in turn being shaped by, everyday practices. Practices shaped by specific socio-cultural dimensions, such as social acceptance within the neighbourhood community, religious meanings, joint family structures, age disparities and gender segregation.

"This study introduces an interdisciplinary framework for investigating building-user interaction in office spaces. The framework is a synthesis of theories from building physics and social psychology including social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behavior, and the drivers-needs-actions-systems ontology for energy-related behaviors.

This study attempts to expand state-of-the-art understanding of: (1) the environmental, personal, and behavioral drivers motivating occupants to interact with building control systems across four seasons, (2) how occupants’ intention to share controls is influenced by social-psychological variables such as attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control in group negotiation dynamic, (3) the perceived ease of usage and knowledge of building technologies, and (4) perceived satisfaction and productivity.

"This study—addressing the absence of a specific and focused analysis of energy sanctions in current literature—provides a longitudinal and quantitative study of economic energy sanctions based on a global perspective. We unpack the design of economic energy sanctions by distinguishing their goals, their measures, and how they are imposed and evolve over time, with the aim of better understanding their effectiveness, cost, and implementability. Drawing on a dataset of officially reported sanctions from 1938 onwards, we find that energy sanctions were particularly frequent between 1973 and 2002, with key senders being the US, Russia, and the UN, each using different sanction regimes, goals, and measures. Analysis reveals that energy sanctions target the distribution segment of the supply chain, and are paired with non-energy sanctions. Further, when variations and changes take place in the design of sanctions, they tend to trigger counter-sanctions. Thus, a possible explanation for senders’ preference not to change or intensify sanctions is the high transaction cost associated with each change in the sanction design. We conclude that transformations and changes taking place in the global energy market are likely to influence the design of future sanctions.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"Used nuclear fuel must be safely disposed. One solution to this complex challenge are deep geological repositories. Participatory approaches accompany the selection of suitable sites for these repositories in many countries and have been studied by risk perception scholars. However, most research has used quantitative cross-sectional data to explain the relationships among the variables of interest (particularly risks) and to inform nuclear policies. In this paper, we introduce a complementary perspective highlighting two fundamental factors: public opinions and their dynamics or stability. We provide results of a longitudinal survey (2 measurements 1 year apart) on plans for a nuclear waste repository in Switzerland. The respondents (N = 841) submitted their own arguments with which they would discuss the site selection process. In addition, we surveyed the respondents’ general opinions. We found a focus on values and responsibility. Those in favor of the repository used different arguments than those who opposed it or were undecided on it.

The year 2007 represents a period of rapid and stable economic growth, while the year 2016 represents the immediate time after a prolonged recession that resulted from both international economic crises and domestic political decisions. Theoretically this study was based on the theory of stealth democracy, and the methodology used was postal surveys and expert interviews.The attitudinal distance between the elite and the citizenry decreased regarding the substance and the process of the energy policy. The citizenry supported stealth democracy more than the elite; people prioritized the experts and businessmen more than elected officials as energy policy-makers, while the elite prioritized the elected officials more than experts and businessmen.

"On the 13th of December 2015, the leaders of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India officially inaugurated the TAPI pipeline, which is set to be the largest cross-country energy infrastructure project undertaken in South Asia with an expected completion date of 2019. The limited literature on TAPI has almost exclusively focused on security impediments to the pipeline from the perspective of the member countries of the project. This paper argues that the solution to these impediments is greatly constrained by a reductionist rather than a multistakeholder approach. Using a broader understanding of the concept of energy diplomacy, this paper argues that energy infrastructure such as the TAPI can be used to encourage interdependency by expanding the number of stakeholders beyond the member countries of the project. While including the interests of external countries and institutions may build consensus on political issues, identifying ways by which the interests of communities can be addressed may reduce the explicit emphasis on the physical security of the pipeline by including human security concerns within the project’s blueprint. The cumulative impact of such an approach may create a shift in the perception of energy projects from the purview of security, to one of inclusive cooperation.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16

This study presents an analysis of the domestic coalitions in support of and those in opposition to renewable energy policies from a discourse network perspective. Discourse networks reflect actors and the arguments they share to advance or hamper the policy process.The analysis draws on a data set of 560 coded statements in support or opposition of renewable energy from media articles, policy documents and interviews. Findings show similar structures of competing coalitions in all three countries, with the discourse in all three countries revealing strong linkages between environmental and economic considerations.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"This article explores the legal aspects of risk governance using the Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. Legal ways of thinking – based on realist risk conceptions requiring a showing of simple causation before granting relief – may derail efforts to address uncertainty. Courts filter risk questions through legal procedures and epistemologies to become legal-scientific risk conceptions. At the same time, lawyers and judges have disproportionate power in violation of the normative goals of risk governance. Furthermore, litigation narrows the number of concepts and parties while adding complexity to already uncertain and multifaceted risks. I argue that the majority’s reasoning in Massachusetts v. EPA suggests that judges can make existing legal mechanisms more responsive to risk governance by incorporating the judicial precautionary principle into case law. This subtle insertion of the precautionary principle into precedent governing legal standing tempered aspects of the law that made responding to systemic risks more difficult. The dissenting opinions reveal underlying ambivalences towards globalization that could impact whether institutions choose to confront systemic risks.

In many instances, these policy tools fail to deliver on their promise, while nonetheless influencing professional and user behavior. This paper draws on Foucault’s theory of governmentality and the Sociology of Standards to explore the effect of voluntary policy tools. Whereas most research focuses on the effect of tools on either intended outcomes or formal policies, this paper considers their effect on the people who directly engage with them. The paper uses the case of the Building Research Establishments Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) to consider the embeddedness and reach of policy tools across communities of practice. The contribution of the paper lies in its focus on the way in which organizational features of BREEAM contribute to its effect on the definition of green building and peoples’ engagement with them. Theoretically, the focus on organizational aspects of governing techniques draws attention local variations in the power/knowledge effect of techniques, thereby contributing to a relatively neglected aspect of governmentality. The paper concludes with reflection on the relevance of this approach for research into other types of policy tools and technical standards.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"Energy markets are in a state of considerable transformation. As a result of new smart energy technologies, novel services can now be offered to customers. The adoption of innovations is often conceptualized in terms of technology diffusion, the success or failure of the new technology depending on how it is able to move across a market. It is taken as given that novel technologies diffuse from innovators to the mass market – a transfer in which non-use is thought to disappear over time. The article challenges the received approach to non-use, building on a typology by Satchell and Dourish, who suggest that non-use is more than lagging adoption: it can also manifest as active resistance, disenchantment, disenfranchisement, disinterest and displacement. The article draws on a survey carried out in Finland in 2013. We proceed from examining the non-adoption of smart energy services to analysing the attitudes linked to the many types of non-use. Thereafter, we will consider forms of non-use that are closely linked to assets and housing. We find that in the case of smart energy services the most important dimensions of non-use are disinterest and disenchantment, alongside lagging adoption. Moreover, disenfranchisement also has a role in explaining non-use.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"The growing penetration of distributed energy generation (DEG) is causing major changes in the electricity market. One key concern is that existing tariffs incentivize ‘free riding’ behavior by households, leading to a cycle of rising electricity prices and DEG adoption, thereby eroding utility revenues and start a death spiral. We developed an agent based model using data from two cities in the U.S. to explore this issue. Our model shows worries about a utility ‘death spiral’ due to the adoption of rooftop solar, under current policies and prices in the U.S., are unfounded. We found, consistently for a number of scenarios, that, while the residential segment is impacted more heavily than the non-residential segment, the scale of PV penetration is minimal, in terms of overall demand reduction and subsequent tariff increases. Also, the rate of adoption would probably be smooth rather than sudden, giving the physical grid, the utility companies, and government policies enough time to adapt. Although our results suggest that fears of a utility death spiral from solar systems are premature, regulators should still monitor revenue losses and the distribution of losses from all forms of DEG. The concerns should lead to a more focus on tariff innovations.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"To achieve UK government targets to reduce carbon emissions by 80% on 1990 levels by 2050 will require a radical shift in domestic heating practices, which are currently dominated by gas central heating,1 installed in 82% of UK homes (Palmer and Cooper, 2014).Using a socio-technical systems analysis, based on Actor Network Theory, this paper examines what can be learned from previous transitions in heating, in particular the series of changes which led from the majority of UK homes being heated by open coal fires in the middle of the twentieth century, to a very high proportion of gas central heating by the end of the century. Two stages of transition are investigated: the expansion of central heating use in the 1950s and early 1960s, initiated by new technology development by the coal industry, followed by the dramatic increase in the use of gas for home heating as the supply was converted to North Sea gas in the late 1960s through to the 1970s. How did a new technology (small bore central heating systems) spread rapidly and effectively, and how was a fundamental change to a natural gas fuel infrastructure achieved? What does this tell us about the establish of strong and stable heating networks, and what are the lessons for future transitions to low carbon heating systems?",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"Energy is not solely a techno-economic question, but has implications for the whole of society – its culture, values, lifestyles, and power structures. Changes in energy systems affect societies over decades, and long-term social and cultural processes in turn affect energy systems. Thus, energy systems should be studied from socio-cultural and futures-oriented perspectives. The purpose of this article is to describe the relationship between energy transitions and social change, and to offer one plausible socio-cultural vision of the era of renewable energy. The article addresses one of the emerging topical areas of energy research – that of rhetoric and sociotechnical imaginaries of energy transitions − surrounding emerging energy systems. Through a literature review, the article first deals with how energy transitions and societal change are related, and then maps out connections between energy and communication technology transitions. It proposes a decentralised peer-to-peer society as an emancipatory and transformative socio-cultural vision of the era of renewable energy systems. Opening up energy futures allows possible and desirable societal futures to be pursued. However, future visions need not be utopian. In order to deal with the possible contradictions of a peer-to-peer future, a critical stance is taken by using the concept of postnormality.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"This paper investigates the changing role of an integral but often overlooked technology within our energy systems: the meter. Empirical cases from the United Kingdom and Australia demonstrate the repurposing of the energy meter. No longer just an instrument of metrology, the meter is increasingly seen by utilities and governments as a key enabling technology for a raft of objectives, from tariff reform to peak load reduction. We draw on the Science and Technology Studies concept of a boundary object to explore these changes. A boundary object is conceptualised as positioned between different social worlds – such as those of householders, government, and utilities – and as having sufficient interpretive flexibility to mediate between their distinct interests. Here we use the boundary object concept to explain the ways in which the meter is being reconfigured, and in particular to analyse the role of householders in the transition to digital meters.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as earlier targets set down in the EU Low-Carbon Road Map, requires a major transformation in the way energy is generated, marketed, and distributed that we call the clean energy transition. The clean energy transition is a social process and its success will be determined by the actions of key actors such as policy makers, energy suppliers and businesses. In this paper, we apply integrative research approaches to engage stakeholders in the renewable energy (RE) sector in knowledge co-construction activities for the case of Spain. Established modes of energy production are very resilient and powerful actors are effectively blocking the energy transition on the basis that it threatens the status quo. Innovation is unlikely unless that veto can be overcome. The work has implications elsewhere, especially for other EU countries, where institutional structures and power relations are similar to those in Spain. To move forward requires a better understanding of the clean energy transition as a social process, and in particular, systematic identification of barriers to innovation and a serious effort to negotiate with the most powerful players.",Volume 34,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/34/suppl/C,16
"Around the world, more than two thirds of the population persist with traditional cooking practices that are deeply embedded within cultural and social norms. This paper discusses insights from a qualitative study on how changes emerge and unfold in these socially embedded energy practices. The research draws on social practice theory to help make sense of the motivations and social processes behind shifting away from a traditional and social norm, and adopt alternative, modern energy practices. Insights are drawn from primary data collected across two study phases in 2015 and 2016 from the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Findings suggest the importance of energy poverty interventions to integrate and consider both intrinsic and extrinsic incentives, practice leadership and positive relations between communities and the institutions that provide support.

"Security of power supply is a crucial element of energy system planning and policy. However, the value that society places on it is not clearly known. Several previous studies estimate the cost of electricity interruptions for individual European Union (EU) Member States – as the Value of Lost Load (VoLL). In this paper, we use a production-function approach to estimate the average annual VoLL for households in all twenty-eight EU Member States. This is the first time that a unified approach has been applied for a single year across the EU. VoLL is further presented on an hourly basis to better understand the impact of the time at which the interruption occurs. Finally, we analyse the impact of ‘substitutability factor’ – the proportion of household activities that are electricity-dependent – on the VoLL. Results from this study show that the differences in VoLL between EU Member States is significantly large, ranging from 3.2 €/kWh in Bulgaria to 15.8 €/kWh in the Netherlands. The annual average VoLL for the EU was calculated to be 8.7 €/kWh.

"Energy transitions face multiple barriers, lock-in, path dependencies and resistance to change which require strategic policy efforts to be overcome. In this regard, it has been increasingly recognised that a multiplicity of instruments – or instrument mixes – are needed to foster low-carbon transitions. In addition, over the past few years a broader conceptualization of policy mixes for sustainability transitions has emerged which we adopt in this special issue. Such a broader perspective not only examines the interaction of instruments, but also captures corresponding policy strategies with their long-term targets and pays greater attention to the associated policy processes. It also encompasses the analysis of overarching policy mix characteristics such as consistency, coherence or credibility, as well as policy design considerations. Furthermore, it embraces the analysis of actors and institutions involved in developing and implementing such policy mixes. To explicitly consider these further aspects of policy mixes, this special issue includes fifteen papers with different analytical perspectives drawing on a range of social science disciplines, such as environmental economics, innovation studies and policy sciences. It is our hope that the conceptual and empirical advances presented here will stimulate diverse future research and inform policy advice on policy mixes for energy transitions.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"To limit global warming to 1.5–2 °C, EU needs to eliminate emissions of CO2 equivalents over the next decades, which necessitates that a range of new technologies develop, mature and diffuse on a massive scale. To create conditions for this, effective instrument mixes have to be designed and implemented. However, the choice of such mixes depends on the analytical rationale for policy intervention. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to scrutinize the analytical base of the EU Commission, contrast it with the work of classical economists and recent innovation scholars, and draw lessons for how effective mixes of policy instruments may be identified. We show that the Commission’s focus on market failures, static efficiency and technology neutrality does not cover all possible obstacles and leads it to neglect the centrality of dynamic efficiency and the structural build-up of innovation systems around new technologies.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"The sheer complexity of sustainability transitions makes it vital to develop simplifying conceptual frameworks. Starting from the contrast between the mainstream innovation-economics and systems-innovation/evolutionary literatures, this paper begins by summarising the “Three Domains” framework, which relates technology innovation and adoption choices to different domains of socio-economic decision-making, at successively larger scales of time and social structures. We note the high-level implications for policy mixes and illustrate the main themes through three electricity technology examples (lighting, fossil fuel generation, and low carbon power systems), and use these also to show that the relative importance of different policy pillars may differ substantially according to the technology and context. We then relate this to the “innovation chain” (another simplifying framework) approach to vertical innovation and show how this can help to explain radical differences in innovation intensities between different sectors. We then expand the innovation chain framework from technology to the multiple journeys required for successful innovation, ordered according to levels of decision-making and hence domains. We conclude by indicating how this can help identify key blockages in energy transformations, and potentially help to reconcile the classical innovation-economics with systems innovation/evolutionary perspectives, and explain their currently divergent policy recommendations.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"Energy democracy is an emergent social movement advancing renewable energy transitions by resisting the fossil-fuel-dominant energy agenda while reclaiming and democratically restructuring energy regimes. By integrating technological change with the potential for socioeconomic and political change, the movement links social justice and equity with energy innovation. Through a policy mix lens, this research examines the energy democracy agenda in the United States to understand how and to what extent the mix of policy instruments currently proposed among energy democracy advocates corresponds to the overarching goals of the movement. This assessment compares 22 policy instruments to 26 intended outcomes for energy democracy. The mix of policy instruments holds potential for advancing renewable energy transitions based on the combined goals of resist-reclaim-restructure, although current policies relate unevenly across the set of intended outcomes. Bolstering the energy democracy agenda will likely require developing new policies, strengthening existing policies, and integrating efforts to simultaneously resist dominant energy systems while also supporting their democratic and inclusive replacement. This research increases the visibility of the energy democracy movement and clarifies and assesses the core claims and policy instruments advanced by its advocates, contributing to policy design for renewable energy transitions and energy democracy.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"Climate and energy targets and instruments coexist in many countries, leading to interactions. In particular, the combination of CO2 targets, the European Union (EU) emission trading scheme and promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) have raised significant concerns in the past, given the allegedly negative influence of RES-E support on CO2 prices. This (negative) interaction has been analysed with modeling techniques, but an assessment of the impact of specific instruments and design features on those interactions has so far been neglected. The aim of this paper is to provide an initial attempt to cover this gap. An analytical framework to discuss the impact of instruments and design features on the interactions is provided and the comparative impact of different instruments and design features on the interactions between RES-E support and CO2 mitigation instruments is evaluated. Our results show that, while negative interactions can be mitigated through coordination, adaptability depends on the choice of instruments and design features. The negative interactions are more likely under quantity-based than under price-based CO2 mitigation instruments. In contrast, they are more likely with price-based than with quantity-based RES-E support instruments. Notwithstanding, the choice of design features critically affects this result.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"China has decided to rely on a variety of policy approaches to achieve its ambitious greenhouse gas mitigation targets, with carbon emissions trading as the latest policy alongside many existing policies, such as GDP CO2 intensity reduction, energy efficiency and renewable energy policies. This article is intended to elucidate from a qualitative perspective the interactions between emissions trading and other relevant policies in China through the analysis of their elements, policy processes, characteristics, dimensions, performances and impacts. Intensive interviews were conducted with more than 50 major stakeholders involved in the policy formulation and implementation process, including policy makers at different levels, experts, industries and verifiers. The authors themselves were also deeply involved in the policy formulation and implementation process. The analysis shows that coordination between emissions trading and other policies, which is urgently needed from many aspects, is lacking in most aspects in practice for many reasons, among which institutional vested interests are possibly the most important. It is proposed that coordination should be conducted at both political and technical levels to achieve the full benefits of emissions trading, and starting from technical aspects may be a practical approach.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"For promoting innovation in the context of sustainability transitions, research emphasizes the importance of combining technology-push and demand-pull instruments in a coordinated policy mix. Designing such policy mixes, however, remains challenging, due to path dependencies, interacting market failures, and uncertainty regarding eventual economic, environmental and societal impacts of innovations. This results in the need for a learning and flexible policy design, but simultaneously, stable political framework conditions are required to bring about lasting changes in production and consumption behaviour. This paper undertakes an economic assessment of how this trade-off between flexibility and stability has been addressed in practice, focussing on a case study of the European and German bioenergy policy mix which serves as a prime example for the challenges of dealing with uncertainty (e.g. regarding land use impacts, GHG balances, cost developments). Informed by the theory of second best, new institutional economics and the interdisciplinary policy mix literature, we identify dimensions for assessing whether relevant uncertainties, interactions between market failures and other constraints on first-best policy making have been handled in a rational manner. From the case study, we derive lessons for bioeconomy policy, as a further example of a decarbonisation policy mix faced by high uncertainty and complexity.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"To meet global climate goals an energy transition is needed. However, energy transitions are complex and long-term processes and require a variety of public policy interventions to steer their direction and speed to achieve global climate change mitigation targets. One area where policy support is required is energy efficiency, which offers a high potential for carbon savings. It is widely acknowledged that energy efficiency improvements will need to be faster and deeper than is currently the case and this requires policy instrument mixes to support both those energy efficiency measures that are simple and cost-effective as well as more complex and costly technologies. In other words, policy mixes need to be well-targeted and comprehensive. In this paper, we address the issue of comprehensiveness in terms of technology-specificity and the level of complexity and costliness of energy efficiency measures. We use an existing dataset produced as part of a pan-European effort to understand instrument mixes in 14 EU Member States in the area of energy efficiency. Based on the empirical analysis and our segmentation of instrument types and their role in the overall mix, we illustrate the need for using a comprehensive instrument mix rather than single instruments.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"In this paper, we present an empirical analysis in order to identify and recommend the most effective policy combinations to steer a sustainable energy transition under alternative crisis scenarios (i.e. crisis worsening vs. crisis reduction). Specifically, focussing on a green energy niche – namely the Italian biofuel sector – we perform a fuzzy inference simulation by means of a two-step investigation. Firstly, we identified the concepts surrounding the investigated sector by means of a specifically designed questionnaire and the related literature. Secondly, we interviewed a pool of experts to map the casual effect relationships among the concepts. Then we used this map to develop the two alternative scenarios and the related most suitable policy mixes to foster the sector development. As expected, our findings show that the most effective policy mixes vary across the scenarios and according to different pursued objectives. This is particularly evident in the case of the job creation’ goal, when the policy mix in the crisis-worsening scenario differs considerably, both in terms of ranking and composition, from the policy mix in the crisis-reduction scenario. Therefore, our evidence supports the need for going beyond a simple one-fits-all approach to deploy the synergistic effect of the policy drivers’ interaction.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"This article connects the literatures of policy evaluation, policy mixes and sustainability transition. It utilises client-oriented evaluation to examine national policies in Finland from the perspective of low-carbon buildings transition. In Finland, energy efficiency has traditionally received less focus in energy and climate policy strategies compared to renewable energy. Since 2007, energy efficiency policies addressing buildings gained force. Sixteen new policy instruments were implemented during 2007–2014 and several revisions were made to the building code energy efficiency requirements. To what extent these changes contribute to ‘creative destruction’ in the policy domain is uncertain. Therefore, we conduct a client-oriented evaluation of the policy mix from the perspective of a boundary actor—integrated energy service companies—to analyse its potential for facilitating zero-carbon transition. The findings show a divergence of opinions regarding the policy mix’s disruptive influence. Where potentially disruptive policy instruments can be found, their impact is reduced due to incoherence in policy implementation processes. The usability of client-oriented evaluation for policy mix analysis is found limited on its own but useful in complementing top-down policy evaluations. We also propose an additional function to the creative destruction policy mix: ‘changes in organisational and institutional practices’, linking to the coherence of policy mixes.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"The energy sector plays a significant role in reaching the ambitious climate policy target of limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2 °C. To this end, technological change has to be redirected and accelerated in the direction of zero-carbon solutions. Given the urgency and magnitude of the climate change challenge it has been argued that this calls for a policy mix which simultaneously supports low-carbon solutions and also deliberately drives the discontinuation of the established technological regime. Yet, the effect of such phase-out policies on the development and diffusion of low-carbon technologies has received little attention in empirical research so far. This paper addresses this gap by taking the case of the transition of the German electricity system towards renewable energies – the so-called Energiewende. Based on a survey of innovation activities of German manufacturers of renewable power generation technologies conducted in 2014 it explores the impact such destabilization policies – most prominently Germany’s nuclear phase-out policy – may have on technological change in renewable energies. By drawing on descriptive statistics and combining insights from earlier regression analyses we find evidence that Germany’s nuclear phase-out policy had a positive influence on manufacturers’ innovation expenditures for renewable energies and was seen as the by far most influential policy instrument for the further expansion of renewable energies in Germany. The insights resulting from our explorative analysis have important implications for the literature on policy mixes and sustainability transitions regarding the ‘flip sides’ to innovation and the crucial importance of destabilization policies for unleashing ‘destructive creation’. We close by discussing policy repercussions for ongoing debates on policies for accelerating the phase-out of coal to meet climate change targets.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"Scholars looking at policy mixes for the energy transition and seeking to facilitate a move away from fossil-based structures are increasingly addressing the opposite side of innovation. To describe this, the article introduces the concept of exnovation, referring to attempts to end fossil-based technological trajectories in a deliberate fashion. It applies a framework that encompasses innovation and exnovation alike in order to investigate the policy mix of the German energy transition. Beside finding that energy transition policy mixes need to emphasize regulatory instruments more in order to bring about decarbonization, the article also describes some general aspects of the policy mix design required to govern the innovation-exnovation nexus.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"The notion of a ‘policy mix’ can describe interactions across a wide range of innovation policies, including ‘motors for creation’ as well as for ‘destruction’. This paper focuses on the United Kingdom’s (UK) ‘new policy direction’ that has weakened support for renewables and energy efficiency schemes while strengthening promotion of nuclear power and hydraulic fracturing for natural gas (‘fracking’). The paper argues that a ‘policy apparatus for incumbency’ is emerging which strengthens key regime-based technologies while arguably damaging emerging niche innovations. Basing the discussion around the three technology-based cases of renewable energy and efficiency, fracking, and nuclear power, this paper refers to this process as “destructive recreation”. Our study raises questions over the extent to which policymaking in the energy field is not so much driven by stated aims around sustainability transitions, as by other policy drivers. It investigates different ‘strategies of incumbency’ including ‘securitization’, ‘masking’, ‘reinvention’, and ‘capture.’ It suggests that analytical frameworks should extend beyond the particular sectors in focus, with notions of what counts as a relevant ‘policy maker’ correspondingly also expanded, in order to explore a wider range of nodes and critical junctures as entry points for understanding how relations of incumbency are forged and reproduced.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"The paper undertakes a closer look on the relation of institutions and policy mixes within the multi-level scope of the European Union in the policy field of resource efficiency and maps out different configurations. Based on an extensive analysis of scope, foci, instruments and especially the distribution of institutional responsibilities in 32 EU countries, the paper aims to amplify the categorisation of policy mix characteristics developed by Rogge and Reichardt by considerations on the institutional background of policy mixes. It specifically brings into question the potential impact of different institutional settings on the consistency and coherence of approaches in this evolving policy field. Resource efficiency is an eminently cross-cutting policy concept and a specific interesting unit of analysis due to the observable heterogeneity of implementation approaches. However, it is still mainly disconnected from energy issues and, at the same time, EU policy has shifted to the circular economy approach, indicating further need for streamlining with the resource efficiency approach. The paper stresses the need to include institutional and multi-level governance issues for policy design and the development of policy mixes, especially in the context of the now refocused resource efficiency agenda to the transition to a circular economy.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"The article discusses transition dynamics towards a Danish low-carbon society based on studies of energy production and consumption. This article shows how the Arena of Development and policy mix approaches may inform the analysis of system transition to a low carbon society. The Arena of Development approach is an actor-centred approach that focuses on how path dependencies of socio-technical systems may be challenged when controversies and matters-of-concern produce ‘arenas’ where established governance configurations and policies of a socio-technical system are challenged. Re-organising actor-constellations are constitutional for arenas and define their boundaries and the policies employed. We discuss the historic transitions in relation to four focal areas of Danish attempts to become independent of fossil energy: wind-power integration in the energy system, energy savings, biomass and sustainable mobility. The analysis demonstrates the conflicts and mixes of policy measures that have moved transition processes forward, but sometimes also stalling them. The analysis shows how changing controversies, arena configurations and policy mixes move forward the energy transition process.","Volume 33, Pages 1-186 (November 2017)",November 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/33/suppl/C,17
"“Interdisciplinarity” is one of the most “fashionable” words to be found in contemporary energy research. The hype and the fuzziness that can characterise its use conceals a bright promise for research: the possibility of opening up new research perspectives, of finding new answers, but also of raising new questions. In this article, we explore interdisciplinarity in energy research through seven questions (corresponding to seven sections): “what does it mean?”, “why?”, “who’s involved?”, “how?”, “what?”, “what barriers?”, and “what prospects?” In the “what does it mean?” section, we will try to illustrate the “degrees of interdisciplinarity” in energy research by means of definitions emanating from recent work. The “why” question focuses on the main benefits of interdisciplinarity, while “who’s involved?” raises the issue of “by whom and with whom”. The “how” section essentially looks at methods and frameworks. The “what” question introduces the main topics of interdisciplinary energy research, presenting the papers that make up this special issue. “What barriers?” and “what prospects?” conclude the paper with an attempt to identify the new research paths that are beginning to emerge.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18

Using qualitative and quantitative methods, we found that employees with a strong energy saving belief were willing to sacrifice some comfort to save energy. Likewise, employees who did not believe that comfort and productivity were negatively related expressed greater willingness to save energy, especially when they perceived organizational support. Meanwhile, positive group norms were related to perceived ease of communicating for employees with a strong energy saving belief. This study demonstrates the need to consider both attitudinal and contextual factors, including their interactions, when examining energy-saving behaviors and their communicational antecedents in the workplace.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18

Air exchange rates, more specifically infiltration rates, were quantified aiming at determining the current airtightness condition of the refurbished schools.

Most PTS research has focused on automated closed-loop systems whereby occupant feedback is automatically integrated into HVAC operations, but such systems are difficult to scale. PTS can also be implemented in a manual closed-loop system, whereby facilities management personnel analyze occupant feedback then make appropriate changes to HVAC operations. This approach may be easier to scale, but little is known regarding how to implement such a program. This paper describes lessons learned from a campus-wide manual closed-loop PTS program at University of California, Davis, after 23 months of implementation. We discuss the program in terms of three main goals: inspiring occupant participation, interpreting the data, and improving comfort and energy efficiency. Each goal requires a different set of skills and resources, which has resulted in an inter-sector and interdisciplinary project team comprised of facilities management staff and behavioral science and engineering researchers.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"Demand response can be applied in a smart grid scenario to promote renewable energy integration by regulating the electricity consumption to match the available renewable production. Buildings are relevant demand response sources for consuming significant amounts of electricity. This paper presents Green Lift, an intervention that explores the demand response potential of indirectly controlling elevators in buildings. Green Lift aims at changing the elevator usage by providing information on “good” and “bad” times to take the elevator, from a CO2 emissions intensity perspective. This is accomplished by installing LEDs beside the elevator doors, linked with real-time CO2 information: the LEDs flash red when electricity produced is CO2 intense and green otherwise. During a one-month field trial, we tested Green Lift in a 12-storey Danish student dormitory. Combining quantitative and qualitative analysis in an interdisciplinary approach, we observed that more people chose the stairwell over the elevator. However, there was no significant reduction in the elevator electricity consumption. Interviews with the residents revealed that the concept of shifting energy consumption was hard to comprehend. We concluded that the studied elevator is not a good source of flexible consumption and we discuss the implications of these results to elevators in other environments.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"The European Union seeks to reduce CO2 emissions in the residential sector by introducing ever stricter energy efficiency standards for newly constructed projects and energy-oriented modernisations. Despite these regulatory efforts, the actual energy consumption significantly deviates from these ambitious goals. Based on this observation it will be argued that it is possible to explain this deviation by putting the focus on users’ practices rather than solely focusing on building physics. In order to determine the impact of building physics and user behaviour on heating energy consumption separately, a mixed methods approach was developed. Actual heat energy consumption data of flats in two German refurbishment areas was collected and semi-standardized interviews with the inhabitants of 80 of these households were conducted. We use qualitative data to identify households’ practices related to energy consumption and measure the relative impact of these practices with quantitative data. Aside from the building physics, we can observe that preferences for thermal comfort as well as ventilation practices have the strongest influence on households’ heating energy consumption after retrofitting. Based on these findings, it is argued that future policy measures should focus on user-technology interface design rather than solely focusing on ever stricter efficiency standards.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"The energy used to construct, operate and eventually demolish buildings has accounted for 40% of total energy used globally and 9% of the world’s greenhouse emissions. When examining major energy consumers such as Europe or the United States, the amounts of energy used for buildings is even higher. The use of energy-efficient technologies (EETs), such as low-energy windows and programmable thermostats, have had many positive results, including long-term energy reductions, a healthier living environment, the creation of jobs, and better quality housing. Unfortunately, there continue to be barriers to the use of EETs. While there are dozens of strategies for overcoming these barriers, many have gotten overlooked or lost. This paper provides a review of the literature that has focused on barriers to the use of EETs and strategies for overcoming these barriers. The method used for identifying relevant literature was a systematic search of scholarly publications addressing barriers and/or strategies for EET use. A theoretical framework is presented as a means of organizing the literature. The framework includes three broad groups of barriers: knowledge of EETs, access to EETs, and desire to use EETs. Strategies for overcoming the barriers are likewise organized and described.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"Resonating with the industrial revolution of the home (Schwartz Cowan, 1989), the smart home ‘digital revolution’ reinvigorates promises for convenience. This paper analyses the industry vision for a ‘simple life’, and asks what energy implications it is likely to generate. We draw on an international magazine and online media content analysis of the 21st Century smart home, alongside 10 interviews conducted with Australian smart home industry professionals. The analysis explores the contradiction between complexity and simplicity embedded in smart home industry visions, where an expanded range of devices, services and options are marketed as a way to simplify and enhance everyday practices. A promoted side-benefit is reduced and more efficient energy consumption. We unpack the expectations embodied in this current convenience narrative to show how smart home devices may transform everyday practices in ways which result in increased energy consumption and household labour. The paper concludes by calling for energy research and scholarship which seeks to disrupt the convenience and other smart home narratives.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"Among co-benefits that energy efficiency interventions in buildings entail, occupants’ improved comfort is one of the most acknowledged. In this study, a monetary valuation of improvements in comfort conditions in accommodation facilities was carried out. With an interdisciplinary approach to the problem, the evaluation was two-folded, aimed at monetizing co-benefits and extra costs of improved indoor environmental quality. Comfort co-benefits were estimated by employing the economic-based Contingent Valuation Method. In this framework, survey results allowed calculating respondents’ Willingness to Pay for excellent comfort conditions in hotel rooms, quantified in a 14% increase of the room rate. The energy approach, based on dynamic simulations, allowed to quantify extra costs of improved thermal condition in a reference existing hotel. These findings suggest that guests’ appreciation of comfort is higher than the investment costs required to provide them with comfortable conditions and highlight that energy efficiency measures are often necessary to reach the desired indoor comfort level.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"Globally, buildings are considerable energy users. Stricter regulations and instruments such as energy performance standards aim at raising energy performance ambitions and reducing energy use. They rely on the implementation and use of efficient technologies, but technical efficiency improvements do not guarantee low consumption. A gap between estimated and actual building energy performance represents a common challenge.Over the building lifecycle, multiple professionals influence energy performance levels: architects, engineers, contractors and facility managers, but also building users. This article concentrates on the building use phase, and how building managers and end-users contribute to increasing or reducing the energy performance gap.Capturing the relations between formal standards, technologies and actual professional work requires interdisciplinary research. Taking professional practices as the starting point, the article draws on facility management and social practice theory, and case studies mapping energy management and use practices in buildings with high performance ambitions in Norway, informed by interviews with owner, facility management and user representatives. This article presents and compares results from two office buildings. It demonstrates and discusses how characteristics of and relationships between professional practices and standards influence the realisation of ambitions, pointing out opportunities for actually achieving and sustaining the targeted energy performance levels.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"The city centre of Cahors (southwest of France) is recognized as a historical heritage site and, like other city centres in Europe, it faces the complex challenge of the thermal retrofitting of old dwellings. This complexity is partly explained by the relative incompatibility of the French energy performance certificate with the retrofitting of old buildings, and by the frequent conflicts between heritage conservation policies and energy efficiency improvements. Today, the level of deterioration and the high vacancy rate of the dwellings, combined with the fuel poverty of their occupants has created an urgent need for an energy retrofit. In order to respond to this set of problems, the city council of Cahors has initiated the “Living Lab” approach, an original idea. The methodology, participants, objectives and obstacles of which are presented in this paper. Living Labs have emerged as a new research concept in which users, traditionally considered as observed subjects and end clients, become co-creators of the innovation process. As opposed to classical approaches, which may fail due to the contradictions among political, ecological, socioeconomic and technological interests, the user centred approach allows the emergence of a sustainable answer in a complex eco-system in a real life context. The first result of this study was the success associated with involving many participants – craftsmen, students, end-users, local authorities, material producers – which enabled an efficient and acceptable solution to be found for refurbishment. Another issue was the improvement of both energy efficiency and hydrothermal indoor comfort for the end-users. Longer term results will be the reduction of fuel poverty for occupants, and a city centre that is alive and enjoyable to live in again.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"It is generally accepted that energy retrofitting of existing buildings is a major challenge for CO2 emission mitigation policies in most countries. The obstacles are numerous with the main issues being well known although not all having clear solutions. The case of collectively owned properties (COP) is probably one of the more difficult challenges. The existing laws and financial assistance are not sufficient to overcome all the barriers to improving the energy use performance of COP. As such, ‘actors’ coaches’ become indispensable at the local level to accompany COP wishing to undergo an energy retrofit.The major outcome of the paper is the development of evaluation mechanisms of the coaching process. The paper analyzes the arrangement of specific stakeholders acting at the local level as “coaches” or “facilitators” for the co-owners, their associations and their trustees, through technical and financial support. The aims of this paper are:- To identify how to evaluate the effectiveness of this coaching,- To try to explain why so few buildings have been retrofit for energy conservation,- To present case studies from the Eurometropole of Strasbourg highlighting the complexities of achieving a retrofit for COP.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"Correctional facilities are some of the most energy intensive buildings and therefore offer a great opportunity for savings from high performance design. We ask the question, can integrative design positively affect building energy consumption, function, safety, and occupant well-being in a corrections building? From 2011–2015, we utilized mixed methods including: document analysis, social network analysis, interviews, focus groups, and surveys to study one correctional facility through the process of design, construction, and operations. We found that adhering to the principles of integrative design resulted in the design of a high performance building that reduced energy consumption, improved building function, increased staff productivity, increased safety and occupant well-being for both staff and offenders. We also found that the design flaws in the building were the direct result of excluding a key building occupant group, offenders. This case illustrates the potential and necessity of integrative design processes to achieve aggressive performance standards.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"Large differences between the expected and actual energy consumption have been found in energy efficient dwellings. Research has shown that these differences are partially caused by occupant behaviour. The financing and payback periods of low carbon technologies are often uncertain because of the impact of the occupants on building performance. This translates into a reluctance to invest in deep renovation projects. The goal of this design-inclusive research project is to develop a solution for zero energy renovation that reduces the uncertainty on building performance cause by occupants’ behaviour by reducing the uncertainty in design decisions and energy calculations. This investigation focuses on the identification of building type specific occupants and their characteristics, requirements and living practices. This paper presents the user research approach developed for the renovation process. The approach consists of statistical analysis of Dutch households, a monitoring campaign in the area of study and co-creation research through mock-ups, enactments and interviews. Case studies results are presented to highlight the effect of different household types on energy consumption and occupants’ requirements, and point at the importance of taking into account household typology and socio-economic characteristics in energy calculations or building simulations, as well as occupant requirements in the design process.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"Most works on the modeling of energy consumption in buildings make little headway in producing results that can be put to use in public policies. They reduce energy consumption to a quantity, without taking account of the behavioral processes and spatial variations that generate and explain them. The objective of our study is to reverse the perspective and to start from energy-related behavior rather than from intensities of consumption. Using regression methods and data from a survey on the energy lifestyles of 1950 households in the Île-de-France (Paris) region, we first model energy-related behaviors by looking at the characteristics of dwellings and buildings, as well as the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of their occupants. Second, we investigate the relationship between behavior and energy consumption by using our models to simulate domestic energy consumption at national scale. Finally, we map energy behaviors at the scale of the Île-de-France region.Energy-related behaviors turn out to be the product of complex interactions between habitat, inhabitants, and environment. Their spatial distribution is linked to territorial dynamics (metropolitanization, distribution of habitat types, etc.), as suggested by our cartographic analysis. But these results also highlight the complexity of the processes, insofar as there are no mechanical explanatory variables for behaviors.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"Energy policies implemented by local authorities and targeted at the domestic sector have focussed on interventions, which are usually selected after an optimisation procedure. This paper identifies differences and similarities between three Medium Layer Super Output Area (MLSOA) districts in the United Kingdom (UK) and draws conclusions which prove to be useful to interpret other districts in the city and provide general rules for energy efficiency measures and distributed supply interventions in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, and potentially beyond. The core argument aims at provide an important link between the energy-reducing and energy-increasing effects of four urban morphology characteristics in ‘place-specific’ neighbourhoods. Our methodology explores the potential application of the close relation between four urban morphological characteristics and the spatial aggregated building energy end-use in the roll-out strategy of interventions. Our findings first indicate that the combination of shape and size of continuous building classes (in a building class the main residential buildings are grouped by their age and building type) and their extent using patch areas potentially simplify retrofit campaigns. We argue that the whole continuous building class influences the building's thermal mass (the building massing) and their extent (the patch area or patch in short) and these are better descriptors for the energy use in the occupational phase of a building. Second, the building massing and the plot ratio (the ratio of the building floor area to the land area in a given territory) are a better descriptors of building density/mixing of land use and built form leading to the potential use of adequate distributed energy supply. Third, the way in which social and economic factors interact to shape area-based of household energy consumption leads to a possible better spatially-enabled policies for low income families; and fourth, the layout and orientation design of the neighbourhood may identify municipal sites for potential renewable energy projects. The use of the building massing and patch areas as spatial cluster operators simplify the complexity of aggregated building energy consumption by representing its spatial incidence through a smooth continuous surface. Additionally, building classes and its patch area extent show notable differences across different sub-city areas. Furthermore, the greater the number of building classes, the more diverse is the socio-economic make-up of a sub-city area.","Volume 32, Pages 1-206 (October 2017)",October 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/32/suppl/C,18
"Energy and climate change research has been dominated by particular methods and approaches to defining and addressing problems, accomplished by gathering and analysing the corresponding forms of evidence. This special issue starts from the broad concepts of stories, narratives, and storytelling to go beyond these analytic conventions, approaching the intersection of nature, humanity, and technology in multiple ways, using lenses from social sciences, humanities, and practitioners’ perspectives. The contributors use stories as data objects to gather, analyse, and critique; stories as an approach to research an inquiry; narrative analysis as a way of crystallising arguments and assumptions; and storytelling as a way of understanding, communicating, and influencing others. In using these forms of evidence and communication, and applying methods, analytical stances, and interpretations that these invite, something new and different results. This essay is a brief introduction to how, in our view, stories and their kin fit in energy and climate change research.

"High-performance buildings are designed to decrease building energy use and provide the benefits of greater comfort, health, and usability to occupants. In these buildings, control technologies have advanced over the past decades, and there has been a tendency for building designers to increase automation to mitigate energy inefficient occupant behaviors. Yet, a growing body of literature has revealed that overly-automated buildings come at a great risk: occupant tolerance for discomfort is significantly reduced as control is withdrawn. Oftentimes researchers ask “what,” “how many,” and “how often?”—but we often neglect to ask the “why” questions in energy-related research. In this paper, “survey stories” from seven occupant behavior/energy studies (which were originally conducted by the authors) are presented to offer lessons learned for future research and design efforts. The authors provide a framework in which stories were categorized into five overarching themes: social concerns, economic concerns, misalignment between designer intent and reality, lack of control over comfort, and pure discomfort. Ultimately, findings indicate that (1) occupant stories are important for understanding how and why occupants use buildings and (2) researchers and designers alike need to increase the frequency and quality of post-occupancy evaluations to improve future building designs.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Fuel poverty in Scotland is currently measured using a definition based on the Boardman ‘10% of income’ conceptualisation of the condition. However, the definition and the metrics used to identify and target fuel poor households are now under review. What is needed is a reconceptualisation of the condition that reconciles the Boardman definition with a wider assessment of vulnerability to fuel poverty and its impacts, and which could reasonably be implemented as part of Scottish Government policy. This study uses observational ethnographics to examine and challenge the current qualitative characterisations of vulnerability, based on fifteen illustrative case studies from Renfrewshire, Scotland. It demonstrates the value of observational studies as a mechanism to provide a fuller picture of how poverty impacts on householders, through gaining insights into underlying factors which are difficult to disentangle through purely quantitative research. It highlights the diversity of the situations of the fuel poor, as well as the high prevalence of poor mental health and wellbeing, and questions how those needs are addressed through current policy. Finally, it sets out the direction of on-going research to develop a complexity science and risk-based assessment of influences on the vulnerability of householders to fuel poverty and its impacts.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Following the shale gas boom in the United States, unconventional natural gas extracted from organic-rich shale rock formations has generated increasing attention in the European Union (EU). This considerable interest has been spurred by a range of optimistic volumetric appraisals of shale gas resource potential trapped beneath the European continent. The paper critically examines rationalities and practices through which states of resource availability and recoverability are made visible, measurable, intelligible, and thus rendered governable, namely open to new fields of possibilities to act upon. By implementing the concept of socio-technical imaginaries as governmentality approach, the analysis is guided by two objectives: first, to identify visions of shale gas potential contained in a range of resource estimates; second, to scrutinize rationalities of government, that is how shale gas resources are made knowable and purposeful, as well as technologies of government that operationalize these rationalities via practices of calculation, visualization, and inscription. The paper illustrates that, these highly speculative and uncertain assessments can forge powerful volumetric imaginaries of shale gas potential that yield specific governing effects concerned with securitization of unconventional hydrocarbons availability. Consequently, these imaginaries prescribe and legitimize techno-political hopes for certain post-conventional energy futures underpinning the fossil fuel abundance narrative.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"In communities on the front lines of energy facilities, citizen science has been seen as potent tool for environmental justice, giving residents access to quantitative data and, as a result, greater credibility with regulators and other experts. However, as in other realms of energy and environmental policy, greater access to data brings with it increased interpretive challenges—challenges which are especially acute for environmental justice-oriented citizen scientists seeking alternatives to scientists’ frameworks for understanding pollution and environmental health. Drawing on Miranda Fricker’s (2007) theory of epistemic injustice, this paper shows that frontline communities’ struggles to understand air quality data manifest “hermeneutic injustices,” or inequities in resources for meaning-making. Following research showing storytelling as one vehicle for making meaning, it argues that the stories told by frontline communities—stories of harms to health, systemic danger, dissembling, and disrespect—can in some circumstances serve as a crucial hermeneutic resource for making sense of air quality data for which scientific frameworks are inadequate. At the same time, it documents the limits of stories in giving meaning to data, pointing to areas of “narrative mismatch” which call for further hermeneutic invention by community groups working in collaboration with sympathetic scientists.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Great expectations have been expressed for carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a key climate change mitigation option, primarily because CCS possesses the political capital to reconcile continued use of fossil fuels with greenhouse gas emissions reduction. However, technological innovation of CCS has recently stagnated, and therefore, CCS still exists largely as a technological imaginary, is shaped more by narrative than by physical reality. This study examines how narratives or imaginaries of CCS technology were constructed in four major Japanese newspapers from 2006 to 2013. Based on a discourse analytic approach, we identify three dominant storylines of CCS: (1) the promise of large CO2 storage capacity; (2) the compatibility with the fossil energy regime; and (3) the forefront of high-tech innovation. The results show that all three storylines are strongly in favor of CCS, inflating blind optimism in the technical prospects of CCS while ignoring the many risks and uncertainties around it. Given the complexities of CCS as a socio-technical system, however, the role of media narratives is to enhance broader social learning about CCS. The paper argues that more plural, balanced, and critical narratives are required to sustain a sound balance between uncertainty and optimism over CCS.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"The European Union (EU) has set its sights on becoming a circular economy, envisaging a transition that implies systemic changes in natural resource transformations and material flows; and offering a response to what is commonly labelled as the ‘take-make-dispose’ conventional economic model. What does the transition toward a circular economy entail and what can it do? This paper analyses the emergence and mobilisation of expectations that are shaping the EU transition to a circular economy. It traces the narrative elements through which the circular economy is configured through an analysis of position papers presented to inform the debate on the European Commission’s circular economy package. Expectations for the circular economy are articulated as: (1) a perfect circle of slow material flows; (2) a shift from consumer to user; (3) growth through circularity and decoupling; and (4) a solution to European renewal. Extending boundaries of what is ‘in’ benefits actors driving the circular economy as, in the short-term, they can actively support a deliberately vague, but uncontroversial, circular economy. On the one hand, the expectations present a strong sense of a collective ‘we’, on the other hand we are yet to see the contentions and contestations being full playing out.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Examining past examples of rapid, transformational changes in energy technologies could help governments understand the factors associated with such transitions. We used an existing dataset to assess government strategies to connect new energy technologies with national narratives.Analyzing the diffusion stories told by experts, we demonstrate how governments connected the new technologies with their national narratives. The United States government supported the development of nuclear power after World War II with the national narrative that the United States was destined to improve creation, increasing the potential of raw materials exponentially for the nation’s good (“atoms for peace,” electricity “too cheap to meter”). In Brazil, the development of sugar cane ethanol was supported by the government’s invoking the national narrative of suffering leading to knowledge and redemption, coupled with the quest for improved societal well-being (technological development to produce ethanol and employment for farmers). In Sweden, biomass energy was tied to the national narrative of local control, as well as love of nature and tradition (the use of natural products).We found strong evidence that the pairing of technological transformations with national narratives facilitated the successful development and implementation of these major energy technologies in the three cases analyzed here.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Climate change narratives often evoke scary scenarios. But in business discourses, the climate change narrative often emerges as an opportunity rather than a threat. This paper examines the predominant business storytelling ploys used by Brazil’s sugarcane industry association, UNICA to promote the industry as environmentally and socially responsible. We used both qualitative and quantitative narrative analysis to analyze thirty-five videos and multimedia presentations produced as part of UNICA’s marketing communications. Drawing on insights about tropes variously evoking hero stories, learning stories and horror stories, we conclude that the sugarcane industry has developed hero and learning stories that portray the sugarcane industry as a sustainable business and ethanol as a ‘green hero’, a green, renewable energy that helps reduce greenhouses gas emissions and thus saves humanity from climate change.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Incumbent socio-technical regimes based on fossil fuels probably cannot be destabilised to the extent necessary to achieve major reductions in carbon emissions without significant policy action. Policy actors, however, remain loyal to fossil fuels. Effective transitions to sustainability will therefore require the identification of political vulnerabilities in fossil fuel regimes. This article identifies one such vulnerability in the form of negative storylines. It describes the development of these storylines using the multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions, as well as four dimensions of frame resonance developed in social movement theory. It then illustrates this phenomenon using an historical case study describing the development of negative storylines portraying the American railways as abusive monopolists during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. These storylines played an important role in destabilising the railways, particularly when they also faced pressures from road transport, as policymakers were unwilling to relax regulations on a regime whose key actors they believed could not be trusted. This article argues that this pattern is unlikely to be unique to this case, but is rather a common development in incumbent socio-technical regimes. This article concludes by considering some implications of these findings for the destabilisation of existing fossil fuel regimes.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Energy is fundamental to human existence, and its ubiquity has allowed energy to enter cultural consciousness in a manner that is reflected in the stories that we tell ourselves and others. Modern society runs on fossil fuels like oil and coal, two resources that are frequently discussed in part due to their contribution to both positive and negative outcomes. This research uses a digital ecocritical approach to explore a corpus of 60 narratives, both fictional and nonfictional, published between 2002 and 2016 by US authors. We combine text mining methods, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling, with selected manual review of texts to posit that American narratives often depict oil as new and exciting, with associated dangers seen as tragic but thrilling. Appalachian coal, by contrast, is portrayed nostalgically, depicted as a nearly familial presence that has betrayed its communities and no longer represents security and prosperity. Thus, while oil is hypothetical and exciting, coal is real and disappointing. Latent cultural attitudes about these and other resources can provide insights as to how Americans view ongoing deployment of energy infrastructure. Further, understanding cultural context can help direct attention to issues of high significance to communities experiencing energy development.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"The imperative of realizing utopian visions of the smart grid puts unprecedented policy focus on standardization. Because standards are a prerequisite for deployment, the US federal government - in a departure from established hands-off practice - intervened to coordinate and accelerate standardization activities. This research uses narrative analysis to explore how such a policy of intervention was constructed. What emerges has elements of a hero story, describing a situation to be remedied: an aging electricity grid, plagued by blackouts and modernization hampered by an electric utility industry composed by stand-alone “silos”. In contrast, the vision of a future “smart grid” with promises of improved energy security, reduced carbon emissions, renewable resources, “green innovation” and jobs. The threat: without standards, the risk that sizable public investments become obsolete prematurely. The villain: unnamed companies engaging in uncompetitive behavior. The unlikely hero: The National Institute of Standards and Technology, able to act as an “honest broker”, proving that the government can as “catalyst” in partnership with industry. While succeeding in making a strong argument for government intervention, the story can be criticized for making exaggerated claims about the effects of standards, for downplaying the complexity of the process and for failure to outline policy alternatives beyond a five-year plan.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Energy transitions involve long-term structural change and are generally presented and discussed in ‘grand narrative’ terms: low carbon, sustainable growth, smart systems. Yet demand for energy services has always been highly distributed and local considerations are also becoming more prominent on the supply side, with developments in distributed electricity generation and heat networks.This paper is based primarily on interviews and observations with low-income householders and their energy advisers, carried out in a district of central Scotland whose economy had depended on coal and paraffin shale mining for over a century. Many older residents had experienced a transition from belonging to fuel-producing communities and handling solid fuels to becoming ‘consumers’ in uneasy and uncomprehending relationships with distant suppliers of gas and electricity. Their stories add texture to ‘grand narratives’ of energy transition, demonstrating, for a particular place and time, some of the complexity and path dependencies of energy systems and how they play out in social and distributional terms. They show how local resources, institutions, social networks and built environment can affect energy services and responses to them, highlighting the role of ‘middle actors’ in an energy advice service as guides to transition.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Oklahoma is an oil and gas state where residents have historically been supportive of the industry. However, a dramatic increase in seismic activity between 2009 and the present, widely attributed to wastewater injection associated with oil and gas production, is a new and highly salient consequence of development. This research engages Oklahoma residents through open-ended interviews on their experience of and reaction to earthquakes. We use these interviews to characterize how energy narratives emerge in response to conflict between environmental outcomes and economic interest associated with a long-standing industry that is personally important to many in the state. We find that seismicity has fractured the dominant narrative of oil and gas development as important for the state into descendant narratives framing seismicity as a minor problem that will be resolved without affecting the oil and gas industry significantly, as a major problem that warrants opposition to the oil and gas industry, or as a problem that needs to be addressed, but not at the cost of all oil and gas development. Trust and a sense of personal efficacy are important in determining people’s reactions, and loss of trust in government is more widely observed than loss of trust in industry.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Oral history provides a means of understanding heating behaviour through encouraging respondents to articulate the past in terms of stories. Unlike other qualitative methods, oral history foregrounds the ontology of personal experiences in a way that is well suited to revealing previously undocumented phenomena in the private world of the home. Three types of change may be distinguished: long term historical change, change associated with the life-cycle stage of the individual and sudden change. A sample of eight in-depth interviews is used to demonstrate the potential of oral history in the study of home heating. The themes to emerge from the interviews include early memories of the home, the financial struggle to heat the home, the influence of childhood experiences in adulthood and the association between warmth and comfort. For the future, domestic comfort, energy conservation and carbon reduction need to be reconciled with one another.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"To achieve energy efficiency targets, the behaviour of building occupants is critical in counteracting or enhancing efficiency measures. Yet behaviour and decisions are construed through the lens of the mental models that occupants hold. We used a mental models methodology to extend previous research in order to elicit occupants’ (N = 25) wider models around how they believe heat operates in their home. The research aim was to analyse the stories of heating, to reveal beliefs that occupants use when ‘operating’ their buildings. Twenty-five participants were asked to relate how they imagined (i) how their thermostat operated, (ii) how quickly their home heated up, (iii) where heat goes to when the heat source is switched off, (iv) how insulation works, (v) how heat flows around the home. We document the variety of mental models and specific features, e.g. how a high internal temperature can stem from a goal to feel warm fast, that when occupants use ‘technical’ vocabulary they may be imagining a different process from ‘experts’, how people use analogies such as wetsuits and weather patterns. We discuss the implications for energy efficiency. The stories of building users around how they operate their heating systems reveal assumptions that influence behaviour and can inform future communications.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"As researchers involved in projects to reduce energy demand within buildings we may differ in our discipline, approach and epistemology; however we all share in common our experiences of energy demand within our own homes and workplaces. This paper centres on our status as ‘insiders’ in the research we conduct, exploring its potential impact on the stories of energy we tell through our research. The paper considers ways in which we may craft more creative stories of energy demand by being reflexive researchers, seeking out the ‘productive moment of friction’ where universalising science meets particular personal experiences. Perspectives on the value of so-called ‘anecdote’, along with issues of representativeness are discussed. Ultimately the paper argues for greater recognition of and more explicit attention to the relationship between the stories of energy we experience in our own lives, and those we tell through our research. It does so in the hope of encouraging an acceptance of the partiality of all knowledge, a practice of pluralism, and thus opportunities to move beyond dominant discourses in policy, industry and academia of what is necessary in order to reduce the demand for energy in our buildings.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Any sociological discussion of energy consumption must necessarily deal with not only the social practices underpinning that consumption, but also the complex sociotechnical assemblages through which such consumption is enabled. Likewise any sociological discussion of climate change must necessarily deal with not only radically different contexts, but also the inherent uncertainty that accompanies any exploration of times yet to come. There are many ways in which one might narrate and/or critique such futures, but few which can handle all of the challenges mentioned above. Such work requires a medium and methodology which can: represent the social alongside the technological; move fluidly between micro, meso and macro scales; reconcile historical trajectories with extrapolated trends and speculative leaps; and – perhaps most importantly—speak across (and beyond) the disciplinary and administrative silos of both the state and the academy. This paper makes a case for the utility of prose science fiction both as a methodological tool of representation and portrayal for energy futures research which meets these criteria, and as a storehouse of tools and strategies for the critique of energy futures.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"There is unequivocal evidence that we are facing the greatest energy transition since the dawn of the industrial age. We need to urgently shift from a global fossil fuel and CO2-emitting energy system to 1) decrease our CO2 emissions and combat the effects of climate change and 2) face a future of depleting fossil fuel resources.Yet there is still a lack of collective action to start taking effective measures to meet these challenges. We argue that there is a need for narratives in general and for a special type of narrative in particular, allohistorical scenarios, that act as thought experiments whose main function is to defamiliarize us with what is taken for granted. Such scenarios invite us to explore plausible parallel paths, thereby making it possible to imagine futures that are essentially different from the path-dependence of an unyielding historical past. Such futures enable us to grapple with a present that is saturated by the inertia of past decisions and the sunken costs of existing infrastructure.We here present the design rationale for the Coalworld scenario: an alternative world where only half the oil ever existed. We also describe the methodology and the assumptions that underlie the Coalworld scenario.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Climate change has been described by Morton (2013) as a ‘hyperobject,’ meaning that its existence is too large for humans to perceive entirely. Climate change policy has been criticized as being bloodless and unimaginative (Watts, 2015), whereas stories have been used to understand climate change through lived experience (Rice et al, 2015). How can storytelling bring climate change policy into focus? Storytelling makes the symbolic visceral, creating a material experience. In many ways, stories connect the ‘out there’ to the here and now, while at the same time inspiring the critical capacity necessary to imagine a then and there, a task critical to policymakers. Using the concept of a geologic imagination as a conceptual springboard, this piece will explore the ways in which storytelling can help climate policy articulate climate change as a visceral, material experience. Though storytelling has been used to understand the day-to-day experience of climate change in peoples’ lives, this paper specifically aims to theorize the ways in which storytelling can be useful for connecting those experiences to the longer story of climate change and how these connections can enhance policy.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"This paper looks at personal transport futures in the context of greenhouse gas emissions reduction, as portrayed in documents from various stakeholders in the transport sector. It analyses the role of frames and narratives in constructing stories of the future, through the lens of two innovations: electric vehicles (EVs) and car clubs. Most of the documents draw on technological progress to tell stories of a future similar to the present but with EVs or other low-carbon vehicles, while car club focused documents stress broader notions of sustainability. A number of economic, technological and political-related frames are identified, which are used in constructing and justifying these stories. Some frames, such as ‘economic growth’, are nearly ubiquitous. Narratives support and are sometimes actively supported by the stories, such as ‘technology neutrality’. Frames and narratives play a key role in creating stories of the future, and help create and maintain expectations and legitimacy of innovations. Frame analysis helps unpick and challenge unrealistic expectations that might leave us unprepared for the future.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"The artificial world is part of an on-going negotiation of meaning, manifesting in social practice. From a sustainability perspective it is thus important to critically examine what norms are imprinted into the artificial, as well as to imagine, materialize and suggest artefacts that could afford more sustainable stories and practices to form. The project Sensing Energy is an attempt to explore how design could contribute to a re-imagination of everyday life and society, as well as what imaginaries (artefacts and related stories) could come out of such an endeavour. A critical and speculative design programme comprising the three leitmotifs Natureculture, Micro-sizing modernity, and Focal things and practices, provided a frame and foundation for a series of design experiments. The resulting artefacts were presented at two different workshops in which participants were asked to form stories that integrated one or more of the design experiments into their everyday life. Based on the material from the workshops we can conclude that the design experiments worked well as parts of or catalysts for new stories of the everyday.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"The article to follow aims to delve deeper into the underexplored but critical role visual representations play in constructing a public narrative of climate change relocation in the United States. Through a visual discourse analysis of American news sources that portray ‘America’s first climate change refugees,’ the article explores how media outlets are using images to construct perceptions of meaning, purpose, and power in stories of climate relocation. It argues that journalistic storytelling of sea level rise and relocation has employed a formula of crisis, ‘othering,’ and victimization in representing the nexus of environmental change and culture in communities across the United States. Through this, the article shows that images and aesthetic codes have constructed and conditioned perceptions of agency in America’s climate discourse that distance and disempower at-risk coastal communities from the reader.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"The actions of individuals are recognised as crucial in reducing energy demand and shifting people towards sustainable energy sources. Much of the work that has occurred within environmental psychology has been built upon a social cognitive paradigm, which attempts to explain the drives, forces and processes that explain and determine individual behaviour. Despite the volume of this work, the promotion of pro-environmental behaviour has not achieved broad transformations in energy conservation behaviours. Recently, researchers working in the field of pro-environmental research have started to draw on narrative in their work as a framework to (re)integrate individuals into their historical, social and cultural settings. However, this work, when applied to energy conservation, remains in its infancy. This paper adds to the growing literature that is increasingly asserting the key role for narrative in the field of pro-environmental psychology research. The paper articulates the foundations of the narrative turn from its development within literary theory to its adoption by the social sciences, with particular reference to psychological theory. This paper provides a review of the ways in which taking a narrative perspective can offer rich insights into complex phenomena, as well as potential ways to reconceptualise ways forward for energy research.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"In Bourdieu’s sociological classic Distinction, he theorized tastes of necessity (in contrast to tastes of luxury) as an habitualized working-class propensity toward consumption practices deduced from constrained economic conditions. These practices also had the capacity to self-perpetuate in the absence of their conditions of generation. This taste/practice may also be called frugality. I encountered this phenomenon in a qualitative analysis of N = 28 interviews with affluent climate change activists in the Washington, DC, area. Though frugality was only practiced by a minority of research participants, it was generally scripted as a motivational component in their climate change activism and imbued with deep meaning and narrative detail. Respondents also referred to an intertwined range of logics of frugality: forced, thrifty, waste-not, environmental, cheap, oppositional and more…. This analysis expands Bourdieu’s insights. There is evidence of an embodied and intergenerational frugality: a frugal habitus/disposition—an echo of once constrained economic conditions. Though frugality may be a practice of some affluent climate change activists, its capacity to reduce human impacts on the environment is questionable and deserves more attention. I also call for a greater acknowledgement and affirmation of frugality and its practitioners.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Several environmental advocacy organizations have emerged that use narrative persuasion techniques to change climate change opinions and overcome climate change inaction. Written from the perspective of parents and grandparents (particularly mothers), the narratives in these testimonials use socio-cultural values and relatable images to motivate environmental concern. This article identifies pernicious hegemonic themes in the testimonial stories that have been featured on the websites of environmental advocacy organizations and critically analyzes these narratives using feminist and queer theoretical frameworks. Two themes are highlighted for analysis: first, themes about the special knowledges, powers, emotions, and duties of motherhood; and second, themes about the importance of preserving the environment for children and their offspring in the future. The oppressive influence of these particular narratives has been argued at length in previous research. Efforts to mitigate climate change are important, but attempts to shape public opinion should not simultaneously reproduce harmful myths about women and motherhood.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"The environmental impact associated with modern ways of living is widely recognized and has been increasingly problematized. A prevailing discourse in sustainable housing tends to focus on building performance, along with compelling stories of “green” lifestyles and attractive urban housing concepts, while avoiding storylines that suggest more profound changes in society and everyday life. This paper argues that in order to address the resource-intensity of contemporary ways of living, we need to engage with perspectives of transition that go beyond technical eco-efficient solutions. Other narratives are therefore explored, based in empirical insights from home visits and in-depth interviews with people seeking less impactful and more self-sufficient ways of living in the context of an affluent society as Sweden. The paper looks at how alternative narratives are manifested in (and through) the home as a starting point for transitions to a low-impact society. Highlighting aspects of agency, situated in the everyday and in the existing built fabric, these “home front transitioners” provide another story – one that questions mainstream assumptions of a pre-defined green lifestyle, and contributes to a more diversified perspective on sustainable living.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"In Native American traditions, humans are viewed as part of the natural system. Thus, all forms of life are related to humans and must be treated with equal respect. Legends, ceremonies, songs, dances, arts, and stories are integrated parts of the spiritual system, instructing people on how to behave with each other and the environment. This perspective piece discusses the role of Native American oral tradition as it relates to Traditional Ecological Knowledge that has been carried through generations, as a means of understanding Native Americans’ role and responsibility to the earth and its resources. The paper also reviews communal intelligence and Native American sustainable design with the aim of translating such knowledge to contemporary aspects of sustainability and green design. Critical thought of the foundations of current day sustainable guidelines and ordinances is needed, along with the application of Seventh Generation Teachings and a move toward a regional perspective of defining sustainability. Finally, this paper is a call for additional nuanced research in the discovery of Traditional Environmental Knowledge held by many Native Americans, to better understand the fragile nature of humans’ relationship to the earth and its provisions and its application to sustainable design paradigms today.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Progressive planning interventions can be characterized as actively seeking to reconfigure bundles of practices. This represents a different strategy for creating momentum for change (in energy demand) compared to prevailing interventions with emphasis on regulation and information. In this article, we explore theoretical understandings of practices and translations as a means to illustrate how certain engagements with strategic work aimed at reconfiguring bundles of practices enable a different approach to establishing momentum for change through planning interventions.We illustrate how the strategic work carried out in a particular case of energy renovation seems to have involved: 1) acknowledgment of the need for reconfiguring bundles of practices, 2) actively enrolling different actors in the reconfiguring of bundles of practices, and 3) basing new practice arrangements on the identification of hidden potentials in prevailing practice architectures.Presented through storytelling, we discuss why an eclectic theoretical interpretation of new forms of planning interventions is important in order to understand and bridge the gap between theoretical insight and planners’ or practitioners’ performance.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Rural community energy projects in the Global South have too frequently been framed within a top-down technologically-driven framework that limits their ability to provide sustainable solutions to energy poverty and improving livelihoods. This framing is linked to how energy interventions are being imagined and constructed by key actors in the sector, via particular sociotechnical imaginaries through which a set of increasingly universalised energy futures for rural communities is prescribed. Projects are too frequently reverse-engineered through the lens of particular combinations of technologies, financial models and delivery mechanisms, rather than by attending to the particular energy needs/aspirations of individual communities. Assumptions over the association between energy access and livelihood enhancement have also reinforced a technocratic determination of appropriate system scale and a search for universalised ‘scaleable’ delivery models. There is, however, no necessary causation between scaleability and outcomes – appropriate implementation scales are not purely determined by technical or financial considerations, rather it is the social scale via which optimum forms of local participation and ownership can be achieved. To operationalise this concern for social space we propose a Social Energy Systems (SES) approach that is advanced via exploration of the interactions between three distinct but mutually edifying variants of energy literacy – energy systems literacy, project community literacy and political literacy.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19

This is followed with an outline of recent forms of participatory climate change initiatives within the UK. The next section presents a more detailed account of the methodology through an analysis of two recent research projects where the Narrative Workshop methodology has been used. The first case study uses examples from a number of workshops held with centre-right public audiences to demonstrate how the methodology has been applied to identify climate change narratives and vocabulary which reflect conservative values. The second case study illustrates how the methodology was used to create a template for a national climate change conversation in Scotland.

"This paper explores the creative uses of stories and storytelling to engage groups and individuals with consideration of changes in energy systems across time and place. It summarises three story-based experiments that responded to the theme of ‘energy utopias’. These are drawn from the three core strands of a much wider body of work undertaken within the Stories of Change project. This took stories as a central motif and organising device to refresh public and political conversations about energy and decarbonisation. Our hypothesis was that stories could offer a popular and engaging route into thinking about the past and present of humanity’s lives with energy and a lively way of imagining possible futures. We also wanted to test the degree to which stories could offer a shared intellectual space that might support both interdisciplinary and co-productive working for a core team that includes social science, humanities, media, computing and design researchers as well as creative and community partners. The paper considers some of the practical, methodological and theoretical considerations and reflects on the strengths and limitations of stories as both motif and technique in supporting action on climate change.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19
"Narratives can help increase experiential engagement with climate change and build support for transitions to a low carbon future. The UK’s 2050 climate targets provide indicatives frames through which emissions reductions could be translated to different contexts. The scenarios outlined in the UK’s fifth carbon budget will require lifestyle changes which may need to counter low levels of acceptance of the need to change through technological, political and behavioural initiatives. This paper explores the role of narratives of the UK’s fifth carbon budget in increasing engagement to climate change. Data are presented from thirty semi-structured interviews with UK academic, policy and practitioner communities. Six narratives are identified that could enable positive engagement with a low carbon future and better engagement on climate change: (i) showcasing investment opportunities; (ii) maintaining independence and freedom of choice; (iii) guiding audiences to visualise a low carbon future; (iv) demonstrating broader appeal, salience and impact of not doing anything; (v) supporting transitions and change; (vi) highlighting benefits to quality of life. Implications of these findings to public engagement on climate change and perceptions of how life may need to be reconfigured in a low carbon future are discussed.","Volume 31, Pages 1-310 (September 2017)",September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/31/suppl/C,19

"This Special Issue explores the anthropology of energy by highlighting the unique contributions an ethnographic perspective offers to understanding energy and ethics. We propose the term energy ethics to capture the ways in which people understand and ethically evaluate energy. The term encompasses the multiple and varied ways that people experience, conceptualize, and evaluate matters of energy. Out of the diversity of fieldsites, research methods, conceptual frameworks, and disciplinary backgrounds that characterize the articles in the special issue, three clear themes emerge. The first is that multiple, conflicting understandings of energy animate how people engage it in their everyday lives and work. The second is that diversity exists in how people make ethical judgments about the role of energy in the types of 'good societies' they imagine for themselves. Finally, the articles underscore the significance of government interests and public policy for shaping people's experiences of and ethical judgments about energy. These perspectives reveal the value of research that is attuned to the ways in which people view the world and the place of energy in it, opening up space to identify and reflect on our taken-for-granted assumptions.","Volume 30, Pages 1-116 (August 2017)",August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/30/suppl/C,20
"This article grapples with the meanings of the notion ‘energy ethics’ by looking at the emergence of what I call the ‘traditional energy paradigm.’ I begin by sketching the distinction between the notions of ‘energy ethics’ and ‘ethics of energy.’ Then, by reflecting on ideas and values implied in the modern Western conceptualization of energy, namely its metaphysical assumptions, I show how this concept is a cultural construct influenced by the natural sciences at the cost of a form of reductionism. Energy has been defined as a property of objects, primarily as the capacity of matter to do work. But this and other similar definitions are strongly dependent on geographical and historical contexts which we often dismiss. These definitions stress only certain measurable, quantifiable, and mechanistic properties of reality. By doing so they implicitly have been promoting instrumental and strongly anthropocentric attitudes toward the use of energy and nature. This traditional energy paradigm has been propagated throughout the world via cultural, socio-economic, and techno-scientific colonization. Different actors have carried out such processes, including multinational companies, educational institutions and international organizations. Meantime, on socio-political levels, this way of understanding energy (and hence natural resources), has found strong allies in neoliberal ideology and free-market capitalism. This homogeneous and colonizing understanding of energy is still prevalent in the energy debate and pervasive in energy policies, preventing different worldviews and more diverse values to be considered. In this article, I argue that the conceptual reduction of energy to what is practically useful, and physically and mathematically measurable hinders more nuanced, complex understandings of what energy might be for different social actors. Energy humanities generally, and energy ethnographies specifically, have a key role in contesting this homogenization, colonization, and hegemony. More diverse perspectives will enrich the energy discourse and hence benefit energy policy.","Volume 30, Pages 1-116 (August 2017)",August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/30/suppl/C,20
"With the advent of renewables, white-collar energy experts have embraced a holistic, intersectional politics at odds with the corporate technocratic outlook characteristic of the energy sector. Concomitantly, anti-racist activists have enfolded technocratic energy issues into their intersectional agenda, situating themselves in the technical spaces that produce electricity. In this paper I argue that renewable energy technologies and the intersectional ethos of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement have operated as a material-discursive node, enabling these coterminous shifts. These shifts are also challenging dominant understandings of what energy fundamentally is amid burgeoning efforts to “democratize” energy. I contend that BLM presents a framework through which we can more radically decolonize energy. Highlighting the historical imbrications of slavery and industrialized energy generation, I argue that colonialism transformed energy – the ability to change matter – into a commoditized form that made certain lives not matter. This framework suggests that pervasive understandings of energy reify colonial hierarchies. As such, I call for intersectional work that reconceptualizes energy in terms of vital relationality. By unleashing energy from its colonial context, we can begin to disentangle the systems through which we change matter from the systems through which certain lives are made to not matter.","Volume 30, Pages 1-116 (August 2017)",August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/30/suppl/C,20

"The UK government has made significant investment into so called ‘fourth-generation’ biofuel technologies. These biofuels are based on engineering the metabolic pathways of bacteria in order to create products compatible with existing infrastructure. Bacteria play an important role in what is promoted as a potentially new biological industrial revolution, which could address some of the negative environmental legacies of the last. This article presents results from ethnographic research with synthetic biologists who are challenged with balancing the curiosity-driven and intrinsically fulfilling scientific task of working with bacteria, alongside the policy-driven task of putting bacteria to work for extrinsic economic gains. In addition, the scientists also have to balance these demands with a new research governance framework, Responsible Research and Innovation, which envisions technoscientific innovation will be responsive to societal concerns and work in collaboration with stakeholders and members of the public. Major themes emerging from the ethnographic research revolve around stewardship, care, responsibility and agency. An overall conflict surfaces between individual agents assuming responsibility for ‘stewarding’ bacteria, against funding systems and structures imposing responsibility for economic growth. We discuss these findings against the theoretical backdrop of a new concept of ‘energopolitics’ and an anthropology of ethics and responsibility.","Volume 30, Pages 1-116 (August 2017)",August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/30/suppl/C,20
"The 2300-person community of Gloucester, New South Wales in Australia anticipated the prospect of coal seam gas (CSG) development, a form of unconventional natural gas, for nearly a decade before a 2016 decision to cancel the project. Gloucester has become well known for its extreme level of community division focused on coal seam gas development: residents report conflicts ranging from blocked access to services through death threats and active boycotts of businesses. We conducted open-ended interviews, participant observation, and mail surveys in Gloucester in late 2015 with the goal of understanding the deeper issues associated with CSG-related conflict in Gloucester. We argue that the long period of stagnant uncertainty associated with the potential development was a major contributor to the amplitude of the community divide. The major conflict focused on whether a coal seam gas development would threaten or accelerate progress toward shared goals of securing Gloucester’s future and maintaining residents’ quality of life. We posit that exacerbating factors include the existence of highly concrete visions of what Gloucester would be like in futures with or without gas and the sense that the community was not empowered to choose whether or not to pursue local gas development.","Volume 30, Pages 1-116 (August 2017)",August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/30/suppl/C,20

It reports the results of an ethnographic study performed at a utility-owned arboretum in Omaha, Nebraska and suggests a “power line poetics” may help balance the aesthetic experience of electric infrastructures and the ethics of renewable energy development.","Volume 30, Pages 1-116 (August 2017)",August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/30/suppl/C,20
"Managing the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle continues to be a systemic issue for nuclear states. This paper examines some of the rationales and justifications for communities that choose to accept nuclear waste, focusing specifically on the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico. The negotiations that the federal government undertook with residents of the town closest to WIPP demonstrate the complex interplay of scientific information, economic and cultural benefits, and trust in governance, in order to make risks from radioactive waste understandable and manageable for a local community. Using the concept of “energopolitics” (Boyer, 2014), this paper seeks to understand how residents of nuclear communities discursively negotiate their relationships to their local environment, technoscientific expertise, and visions of the future through the materiality of nuclear waste, by using interviews, site visits, and public meeting testimonies from various stakeholders.","Volume 30, Pages 1-116 (August 2017)",August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/30/suppl/C,20
"In recent years, debates about energy justice have become increasingly prominent. However, the question of what is at stake in claims about energy justice or injustice is a complex one. Signifying more than simply the fair distribution of quantities of energy, energy justice also implies issues of procedural justice (participation) and recognition (acknowledgement of diverse values constitutive of ways of life). It is argued that this requires an acknowledgement of why energy use matters in everyday life.Data from the Energy Biographies project at Cardiff University is used to explore connections between the relational texture of everyday life and the ethical significance of energy. In particular, it is demonstrated that embodiment, attachment and narrative are features of sense-making that contribute significantly to everyday understandings of the ethical meanings of different ways of using energy. Using multimodal and biographical qualitative social science allows these implicit forms of evaluation to become more tangible, along with the relationships between them. Conceiving of energy consumers as subjects with biographies, with attachments, and as engaged bodily in energy consumption can open up, it is suggested, different ways of enacting the procedural and recognition aspects of energy justice.","Volume 30, Pages 1-116 (August 2017)",August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/30/suppl/C,20
"The transition to renewable energy means a new energy subjectivity is emerging. The “green” energy consumer may now harness an array of socio-technical practices: prosumption, green energy sources, feed-in tariffs, Smart metering etc. This article presents data about three off-grid energy systems in the UK: a small-scale solar-PV system set up in a dwelling at an ecovillage; a mixed hydro-electric and Solar-PV system that served an off-grid household; and a large hydro-electric power system that supplied electricity to an entire ecovillage of nine households. In off-grid contexts there is frequent temporal and seasonal energy abundance, tempered by the perennial problem of how to store electricity. The synchronization of everyday and domestic practices with the rhythms of power generation thus defines an off-grid energy ethics. This article argues that the new off-grid energy subjectivity shows many characteristics of self-governance that are attributed to the emergent green pro/consumer, and can therefore provide insight into the partiality and rhetorical framing of the green energy consumer. Living off-grid is imagined by its practitioners in ethical terms, at the forefront of a timely reconfiguration of industrialised societies' moral relationship with energy.","Volume 30, Pages 1-116 (August 2017)",August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/30/suppl/C,20
"In Zambia, privately-owned copper mines consume more than half of the electrical energy produced. By contrast, only 22% of private households are connected to the national grid. Against this background, the paper analyses energy distribution in Zambia’s Northwestern Province, where new copper mines have opened following the hike in copper prices during the 2000’s. Unlike rural families, residents in the three new urban centres in theory have access to electricity. Since 2015, however, the country suffers from an electricity crisis partly as a result of poor rainfalls in the 2014/2015 season. In a situation of undersupply, the mine keeps unlimited access to electricity which privileges its operations and the housing areas. Daily blackouts for the rest of the town entrench existing inequalities and produce new ones.Based on long-term ethnographic research, the paper examines how electrical infrastructure and the possibility for forms of sociality relate both in the everyday and in the political discourse. I show how unequal electrical infrastructure contributes to the structuring of people into new social classes, and how, consequently, infrastructure is political from the start. By reflecting on the political and social consequences of unequal electricity supply, I provide preliminary thoughts on an energy distribution ethic.","Volume 30, Pages 1-116 (August 2017)",August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/30/suppl/C,20
"Many energy researchers and practitioners envision householders to have an active role in local energy distribution in emerging energy systems. In the energy literature, the dominant view of local energy distribution, grounded in the rational choice perspective, sees exchanges of energy between households as energy trading. The existing energy literature lacks conceptualization of social and personal exchange of energy between households that is mutually structured and negotiated. This article builds on the theoretical works of an economic anthropologist, Stephen Gudeman, to conceptually discuss such energy exchanges. This article reports from an ‘ethnographic intervention’ study conducted at an off-grid village in rural India for three months (1 February–30 April 2016). The ethnographic data analysis reveals how social relations and diverse cultural values influence on energy exchanges between households in the village. The article introduces ‘circle of mutual energy exchange’ as a conceptual, analytical and descriptive unit for understanding such energy exchanges. The article describes two co-existing and dialectically connected modes of energy exchanges: ‘mutual energy sharing’ and ‘mutual energy trading.’","Volume 30, Pages 1-116 (August 2017)",August 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/30/suppl/C,20
"Energy labels are a means of providing consumers with a way of understanding the environmental and energy impacts associated with many products and services. These labels are designed to help consumers to compare options and to select more energy efficient products. Such labels often contain large amounts of information, displayed in a range of metrics, such as carbon dioxide emissions in grams, energy use in kilowatt hours, and noise emissions in decibels. This paper presents the results of an eye-tracking experiment undertaken to assess energy labels from both the whitegoods and motor sectors. Specific focus is put upon the elements that make up these labels, and how effective these elements are at transmitting the necessary information to the consumer. Based upon the results of this study it is possible to generate heat maps, scan paths, and statistical analysis formed from defined areas of interest within the energy labels. These results highlight the effectiveness of colour coding (traffic light style) and simple alphabetic grading, in terms of drawing the attention of consumers. This research also contained information recall tasks based upon the data provided to respondents, and an analysis of these results highlights the notable variation in recollection accuracy for the different types of information provided by the labels. Based upon these results, a number of recommendations are made concerning potential label design.",Volume 29,July 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/29/suppl/C,21

"In late September 2016, a severe thunderstorm and tornado outbreak hit the state of South Australia, causing a state-wide blackout. In its immediate aftermath, conservatives in Australia's media and political parties began laying blame for the blackout on the state's significant wind-power capacity, while criticizing South Australia and other Labor states for promoting renewable energy targets which are ‘unrealistic’ and a ‘threat to energy security’. Despite receiving advice from its own public servants, independent experts and industry players that these criticisms are wrong, the Coalition Government has sought to use the blackout as the foundation for an anti-renewables, pro-coal energy campaign. Although this strategy was clearly intended to provide a distraction from its other problems, and was partially assisted by the way in which subsequent assessments of the causes of the blackout were represented by the relevant agency and some elements of the media, it has instead served to highlight the Coalition's failure to create a coherent energy policy, or to adequately address the significant challenges currently facing Australia's electricity network. Both of these policy failures are directly attributable to its dedication to protecting incumbent fossil fuel interests, while denying the role played by fossil fuels in driving climate change.",Volume 29,July 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/29/suppl/C,21
"How do people interpret ambiguous and uncertain events? This study explores this question in the context of unconventional oil and gas development, or “fracking”, with implications for natural resource extraction generally. Drawing on the theories of social representations and framing, we test the hypothesis that legacies of natural resource extraction – conceptualized here as collective schemata of interpretation – shape perceptions and actions toward new forms of energy development. Based on an analysis of survey data from the “Twin Tiers” regions of New York and Pennsylvania (n = 590), we find that negatively perceived legacies of past resource dependence, net of other factors, lead to opposition and political behaviors related to unconventional oil and gas development. Our findings suggest that regional legacies of natural resource extraction act as a sense making tool, working to translate the ambiguous, novel phenomenon of unconventional oil and gas development into something understandable in light of past experiences.",Volume 29,July 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/29/suppl/C,21
"Tidal energy is a renewable energy source that could be used to help mitigate climate change. Tidal energy technology is in the early stages of development and views towards this technology and energy source are not well understood. Through a representative mail survey of Washington State residents, we assessed attitudes and behaviors related to tidal energy, perceived benefits and risks, and climate change beliefs. Higher levels of perceived benefits and climate change beliefs were associated with increased acceptability of and support for tidal energy whereas greater perceived risks were associated with decreased acceptability and support (acceptability being an attitudinal construct, support a behavioral construct). Coastal residents reported higher levels of acceptability and support than non-coastal residents. Pulling from innovation theory, we show that levels of support depended upon the development lifecycle stage of the technology. Support declined once the project moved into the water from the lab, however, grid-connected pilot projects were more likely to be supported than those without grid-connection. Policies developed to encourage the development of tidal energy may be more accepted and supported if they include incentives for pilot phases with grid-connection.",Volume 29,July 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/29/suppl/C,21
"There is a shortage of scholarly research into understanding the cultural values, drivers and outcomes of community renewable developments. This paper contributes towards addressing this gap, by comparing four community renewable projects set in Scottish Gaelic speaking Scotland and in Welsh speaking Wales. Not only do cultural values drive the developments of these community energy projects, but evidence gathered here through qualitative interviews show that these communities aim to contribute towards the long term cultural sustainability of their respective areas. This research paper focuses on how community wind energy projects in Scotland and Wales have contributed towards the retention of cultural attributes, particularly language retention and revitalisation. It also contributes to a deeper understanding of the cultural reasons why historically indigenous communities are turning towards the renewable energy sector (and developing their own local projects) as a way to help achieve cultural sustainability through economic development.",Volume 29,July 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/29/suppl/C,21
"Thirty years of North American research on public acceptance of wind energy has produced important insights, yet knowledge gaps remain. This review synthesizes the literature, revealing the following lessons learned. (1) North American support for wind has been consistently high. (2) The NIMBY explanation for resistance to wind development is invalid. (3) Socioeconomic impacts of wind development are strongly tied to acceptance. (4) Sound and visual impacts of wind facilities are strongly tied to annoyance and opposition, and ignoring these concerns can exacerbate conflict. (5) Environmental concerns matter, though less than other factors, and these concerns can both help and hinder wind development. (6) Issues of fairness, participation, and trust during the development process influence acceptance. (7) Distance from turbines affects other explanatory variables, but alone its influence is unclear. (8) Viewing opposition as something to be overcome prevents meaningful understandings and implementation of best practices. (9) Implementation of research findings into practice has been limited. The paper also identifies areas for future research on wind acceptance. With continued research efforts and a commitment toward implementing research findings into developer and policymaker practice, conflict and perceived injustices around proposed and existing wind energy facilities might be significantly lessened.",Volume 29,July 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/29/suppl/C,21
"Thermal comfort is central to energy consumption in housing and one of the main drivers behind worldwide GHG emissions. Research on residential energy consumption has therefore addressed comfort in relation to indoor temperatures. This paper argues that by widening the focus of comfort to include other aspects such as air, light and materials, more sustainable ideas of residential comfort might be developed. The paper takes a practice theoretical perspective but argues that the senses should be better incorporated into the approach to understand different aspects of comfort. The paper investigates how comfort can be understood as sensorial within theories of practice. This implies understanding how the senses are incorporated in embodied and routinised social practices, through which comfort is sensed and interpreted. Comfort is related to a range of everyday practices in the home, and the paper describes how aspects of comfort are perceived differently within different practices. The study is based on qualitative interview data from a Danish field study. However, the findings on how comfort in houses can be understood have a broader relevance as well. It is argued that this nuanced perspective on comfort can contribute to widening the debate and policy on residential energy consumption.",Volume 29,July 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/29/suppl/C,21
"Serious games and gamification to engage consumers in pro-environmental behaviours for energy efficiency are in their infancy. To date, despite growing interest and some initial attempts, their potential to engage consumers in energy efficiency behaviours has been understudied. To provide an overview of serious games and gamification to engage individuals in pro-environmental behaviours for energy efficiency, a computer-based search for relevant publications was performed in several databases. After applying the inclusion criteria and removing duplicates, 10 papers were included in this systematic review. Results showed that serious games and gamification have been used in three different areas related to energy efficiency: environmental education, consumption awareness, and pro-environmental behaviours. This review also showed that applied gaming interventions can be used in more than one of these three areas (comprehensive interventions). The main observation to be drawn from this review is that both serious games and gamification can foster energy-saving behaviours and vary widely in terms of type of games and of features that might be appealing and motivating.",Volume 29,July 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/29/suppl/C,21
"Energy production can pose risks, such as nuclear accidents, oil spills, and earthquakes caused by gas production. Besides experts’ evaluations of risks, appropriate risk assessment and management require knowledge about how people experience these risks and which mitigation measures they prefer. Media are often the sole source of information about public risk perceptions. Yet, media typically only report the most severe risks. By studying perceptions of different types of risks – among people with varying exposure to risks – we demonstrate how social science research can complement media reporting. We conducted a longitudinal questionnaire study into public risk perceptions of earthquakes caused by gas production in the province of Groningen, the Netherlands. While the media have reported multiple high risks and strong negative emotions, we found that people were mostly concerned about the risks for properties and for the image of the province of Groningen. Feeling powerless was the strongest negative emotion. People also evaluated mitigation measures as urgent but poorly implemented. Our results suggest that appropriate risk assessment and management need to follow a multi-method approach. This should incorporate multiple levels of analyses, including media reports, social science research on public risk perceptions, and experts’ evaluations of risks.",Volume 29,July 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/29/suppl/C,21
"Nowadays, a growing number of initiatives are being enacted to increase direct public participation on energy policymaking, a move that is seen as almost automatically granting more effectiveness and social acceptance to energy policy. Seeking to establish a counterpoint to such enthusiasm, this paper argues that there is nothing simple and automatically rewarding in the practical enactment of such “participative turn” in energy policy. As the current critical literature on the challenges of enacting public engagement shows, public participation is beset with all kind of risks and uncertainties, usually producing results that are quite different from the ones expected. In order to ground this point, this paper analyzes the case of a participative policy carried out by the Ministry of Energy in Chile. The rather messy results of such initiative will be used to show how the proper materialization of the “participative turn” in energy policy needs policymakers to radically change their notions about what public participation is, who are the ones participating, and what could be expected from them.",Volume 29,July 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/29/suppl/C,21
"Oil and gas (O&G) operations are periodically accompanied by fires and explosions. The frequency of these incidents is not well known, particularly at modern sites that increasingly use advanced techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. The objective of this work is to determine the rate of fires and explosions at O&G sites in Colorado and Utah and apply this information to evaluate the proximity of these incidents to residences. Between 2006 and 2015, a total of 116 fires and explosions in Colorado (0.03% of active wells) and 67 fires or explosions in Utah (0.07% of active wells) were reported at O&G operations. The higher percentage of fires or explosions per number of active wells in Utah compared to Colorado (Rate Ratio = 2.49, p < 0.01) is likely influenced by the mandatory self-reporting requirements in Utah and the more lenient self-reporting in Colorado. The average number of residences within 1609 m of the reported incident was 31 (median = 3, SD = 131) in the Denver Julesburg Basin and 4 (median = 0, SD = 10) in the Piceance Basin of Colorado.

"Since the 70s, Sweden has gradually replaced oil with renewables to provide energy for heating, and today the country uses the highest total amount of renewable energy for heating of all EU Member States. However, there are signs of new tensions in the heat-energy system, and of lock-in of less sustainable practices. Using the multi-level perspective (MLP), this paper assesses to what degree the sociotechnical regime in Sweden's heat-energy system is stable and locked-in, and whether there are emerging tensions. We identify three key characteristics of the regime – interconnectedness, complementarity and saturation – that together risk creating tensions and lock-in of less sustainable practices.

"The concept of energy justice has brought philosophies of ethics and principles of social justice to bear on a range of contemporary energy issues. More inter-disciplinary and applied endeavours are now needed to take this field forward. One such application is to the issue of fuel poverty and the challenge of retrofitting inefficient housing stock. An energy justice perspective sees fuel poverty as a fundamentally socio-political injustice, not just one of uneven distribution. Starting from this premise, we highlight the multiple injustices faced by two groups who are regarded by policymakers as being particularly vulnerable to fuel poverty: disabled people and low-income families. In the UK, these groups are nominally prioritised within fuel poverty policy, but their complex situations are not always fully appreciated. Building on the theoretical foundations of energy justice, we present an inter-disciplinary dialogue that connects this approach with wider vulnerability research and domestic energy efficiency policy. Specifically, we discuss ‘within group’ heterogeneity (recognition justice), stakeholder engagement in policy and governance (procedural justice) and the overlap of multiple structural inequalities (distributional justice). In each section we illustrate the added value of combining justice and vulnerability conceptualisations by linking them to domestic energy efficiency schemes.",Volume 29,July 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/29/suppl/C,21
"Though there is a growing literature on the value of participatory siting processes for increasing local acceptance of wind energy development, there has been much less unpacking of how residents view the siting process itself. We explore differences in the ways governments and developers enact planning and how this impacts both acceptance/support and procedural justice outcomes. This mixed methods study employed in-depth interviews (n = 54) and surveys (n = 252) with multiple stakeholder groups to understand perceptions of procedural justice across two Canadian provinces. We compared Ontario – which has built a strong base of wind energy capacity using technocratic siting procedures with Nova Scotia – which has anchored its development strategy more explicitly with a community-based program. We find stronger levels of perceived procedural justice in Nova Scotia across the majority of principles tested. In Ontario, opposition to local developments was highly conflated with a lack of procedural justice including few opportunities to take part in siting. Across both provinces however, specific aspects of planning processes – mostly related to ‘the ability to affect the outcome’ – were strong predictors of local approval of wind.

"Policies promoting the adoption of residential solar photovoltaic systems often include financial incentives. This research uses Diffusion of Innovations Theory to assess the effects of incentives on the adoption of residential solar systems based on three previously defined conclusions: that incentives increase adoption; that incentives promote adoption by a group of consumers different to those who would otherwise adopt; and that adoption to access incentives may reduce the likelihood of re-adoption. A mail-out survey of 338 householders who purchased a solar system was undertaken in Western Australia in 2013, followed by 26 interviews during 2013–2015. Financial incentives were prioritised in the decision-making process by 70% of survey respondents. Incentives promoted adoption by reducing the payback period of systems and also acted as a ‘cue-to-action’ for those who were considering adoption. The vast majority of survey respondents (82%) installed their solar system for financial reasons, representing a change in motivation away from the ‘early adopters’ who prioritise the technical and environmental aspects of solar. Survey respondents who educated themselves about solar and/or installed solar for environmental or technical reasons were more likely to readopt. 85% of survey respondents indicated that education is needed to understand the costs and benefits of solar.",Volume 29,July 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/29/suppl/C,21
"In order to combat climate change and reduce carbon dioxide emissions as suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the contemplation of different knowledge types is discussed as a leverage point for transforming towards sustainability. In order to analyse how a science-practice dialogue can improve the understanding of transformation processes towards low-carbon societies, we set up a dialogue process in North Rhine-Westphalia to envision a low-carbon future. We addressed the deficits of previous transdisciplinary projects and tested different dialogue formats. The approach applied put us scientists in the unusual position as facilitators of dialogue. This contained some challenges but also offered an in-depth understanding of the science-practice dialogue that would not been possible with traditional scientific methods. The participating stakeholder perceived bringing together different actors with complementary knowledge and experience and associated mutual learning as beneficial. However, the wish not only to gain knowledge but to influence decision making determines whether a dialogue process is perceived as effective. We found that envisioning processes are valuable to explore highly uncertain future processes.

"Recent definitions of energy security have evolved to include qualitative dimensions, such as social acceptability, alongside more classic issues such as the availability and affordability of energy supplies. Despite the importance of lay-public opinion in shaping energy and environmental policy, however, currently relatively little is known about the underlying nature of people’s attitudes towards energy security. The current study used an online survey to gather perceptions of energy security in samples from two neighbouring countries with a historical reliance on energy imports (i.e. Greece & Turkey). There was a specific focus on understanding the relationships between individuals’ pro-environmental and pro-cultural orientations and their energy security concerns. The results not only confirm the multifaceted nature of energy security attitudes but also indicate that the extent and nature of this concern (both in general and in terms of a number of sub-facets of concern) differs between populations. While pro-cultural orientations were not predictive of concern in either subsample, pro-environmental orientations were (e.g. for concerns about fossil fuel depletion within the Greek subsample).

"The paper examines shale gas development as a situation of resource exploration loaded with multiple uncertainties stemming not only from technology-generated unknowns but mainly from the unknowns about the volume of exploitable resource and about the ways in which shale gas industry will exist ‘locally’. By examining first information meetings organized by NGOs, companies and local authorities in Poland: Przywidz, Mikołajki Pomorskie and Żurawlów, the paper shows that uncertainty is built around three dimensions that are to be shared by communities and companies if exploration takes place: knowledge, space and time. Discussions around these three issues reveal knowledge deficits on all sides, contributing to the emergence of new areas of uncertainty and making any agreement difficult. By referring to the concept of ‘hybrid forums’, the analysis also shows how a gathering that is initially framed by the organizers as an ‘information meeting’ transforms into a ‘hybrid forum’ where new facts, values and identities emerge due to the confrontation of perspectives represented by heterogeneous stakeholders.",Volume 28,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/28/suppl/C,22
"Solar cookers have been tested and studied in various settings, but despite their envisioned benefits – reduction of deforestation, economic benefits, improved health, and empowerment of women – results have been modest at best. This article performs a critical review of the literature on solar cooking (SC), to scrutinise the assumptions and methodological choices that may explain this conundrum. The literature review yielded 32 articles on solar cookers in Sub-Saharan Africa, where most SC projects can be found. Four recurrent types of issues stand out: local needs are often not sufficiently considered, existing cooking and fuelwood practices are seen as obstacles, many articles show a prosolution bias and there is a lack of methodologically sound impact studies. To overcome these issues, practice theory – which analyses the practice of cooking from the logic of the practice, rather than from an external point of view – is proposed to guide and focus future SC projects and studies. Furthermore, ethnographical methods can provide new and grounded evidence and allow for a stronger focus on local needs. These approaches can provide a fruitful evidence base to analyse the role of solar-cooking in achieving sustainable and long-term development benefits in the Global South.",Volume 28,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/28/suppl/C,22
"The practice of working from home has become widespread in developed countries, and the numbers of regular home workers are steadily increasing. There are potentially positive implications for energy consumption associated with home working, but these depend on myriad variables. This qualitative study, based on interviews with regular home workers, provides a more in-depth perspective on how and why energy is used compared with quantitative models of household consumption. Ethnographic research data is analysed using insights from practice theory. Placing the practice at the heart of analysis, it explores meanings, materials and competences involved in home working, and attends to the affective experiences of practitioners. Considering working from home as an integrative practice, it explores how dispersed practices are incorporated into individual performances, bringing about affective satisfaction. Findings show that the practice of working from home is characterised by themes of comfort, control and flexibility, with implications for energy demand. It is argued that the synthesis of practice theory and affect can provide valuable insights for energy research. The paper discusses the implications for demand reduction, demand shifting and ‘smart’ controls, with reference to the role of employers, researchers, policy makers and home workers themselves.",Volume 28,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/28/suppl/C,22
"This paper examines the relationship between loss aversion and consumer behaviour in a non-price policy intervention that followed the installation of smart meter (SM) technology. Drawing upon insights from behavioural economics, we propose that consumers underestimate potential gains and overestimate potential financial losses resulting from electricity use. To test the hypothesis, we carried out a pilot study involving the installation of SM technology in Copenhagen, Denmark. The analysis used two baselines, and the differential effects revealed that the provision of loss-framed, salient information reduced daily demand by 7–11%, compared to unframed information. Reductions in standby consumption were more pronounced, with a differential effect of 16–25%. Despite the limitations inherent in a pilot study, notably the small sample size, the findings suggest that policies that address SM technology need to consider not only the pure provision of information, but also how it is designed and presented to users. Several aspects for further research are identified.",Volume 28,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/28/suppl/C,22
"This article shines a light on a less examined aspect of sustainable energy transitions: governing for demand side innovations in Germany. Demand innovations are considered to be central to affordable, efficient and politically acceptable energy system transformations, however many argue that not enough is being done in governance terms. In a departure from much analysis on demand policy demand innovations are defined broadly here to explicitly include demand side response, demand reduction and distributed energy – given that each has important roles to play within demand-oriented markets. Demand governance is conceptualised as a long-term political process that is both contextually specific but also open to challenge and change at various points in time. The single case study is Germany where demand governance, recent changes in energy markets, and implications for how the politics of energy are changing are all analysed. This paper reveals the specific ways in which critical policy debates emerge over time and influence political decision-making; the ways in which these debates relate to changes in energy markets; as well as a lack of governance in relation to enabling demand side response and local energy markets.",Volume 28,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/28/suppl/C,22
"Indoor climate control forms a major share of residential energy demand. Policy measures to curb this demand tend to focus on energy-efficient technologies. However, while the energy efficiency of domestic heat provision in the United Kingdom (UK) has increased considerably over the past century, demand for space heating has increased as well. This paper offers a distinctive explanation of increasing levels of domestic demand for space heating. It is grounded in a case study on changes in social housing design and use in the UK between 1920 and 1970. Based on detailed analysis of the co-evolution of housing circumstances, heating provision and patterns of everyday practice, the paper argues that increases in demand for space heating can be understood as a spreading of such demand over domestic space and time. In explaining this spread, it identifies three key contributing processes, comprising: 1) materialisations of ideals of separating domestic activities; 2) delegations of work and control to infrastructures and appliances; and 3) shifts towards more indoor, sedentary activities. It closes by considering how understanding these processes historically can inform contemporary energy policy to curb domestic energy demand for heating, and how the distinctive approach taken has implications for energy research.",Volume 28,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/28/suppl/C,22
"The social science literature on energy lacks much attention to private and semi-private energy companies and their efforts to reduce the impacts of the ongoing climate change. This paper explores one of the dominating energy companies in Europe, Statoil, and its strategic decisions that determine which type of energy technology multinational corporations choose to invest in or to acquire. The author develops the concept of two different paths to investigate the company’s role within this context. The black energy path implies continued production of hydrocarbons and investment in more advanced technology to create economic output for Statoil. By contrast, diversifying into the green energy path has the potential to close the gap between the black and green path, step-by-step. The author discusses Statoil’s decisions that have an environmental objective. He concludes that despite new initiatives having been taken to close the gap between Statoil’s fossil and renewable energy paths within offshore wind and carbon capture and storage, as well as the new and upcoming gas projects in the company’s portfolio, the company is highly path-dependent on the black carbon path and is prolonging its corporate strategy towards increased oil and gas investments.",Volume 28,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/28/suppl/C,22
"There is a significant ‘action gap’ between what scientists argue is necessary to prevent potentially dangerous climate change and what the government, industry and public are doing. This paper argues that a coherent strategic narrative is key to making meaningful progress. It does this by first analysing a number of narratives which have been used to try and create audience buy-in on the need for action on climate change, and those that argue that no action needs to be taken. A framework is then proposed for how compelling and unifying strategic narratives on climate change might be constructed. It is suggested that the unifying strategic narrative could address the complex range of actors who need to be engaged, provide a coherent explanation for government strategy, and harness the drivers of behavioural change needed to meet the challenge. Research into climate change strategic narratives is nascent, but the authors believe that there is much to be gained from pursuing and intensifying this research.",Volume 28,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/28/suppl/C,22
"This interdisciplinary review paper explores linkages between access to energy, women's empowerment and entrepreneurship. This will be discussed in the context of the informal food sector. Despite expectations that access to energy for productive uses empowers women by enabling them to generate an income, women in developing countries face a range of barriers when establishing and operating enterprises, including access to energy. The literature reviewed in this paper suggests that, although improved access to energy for women in the informal food sector may create a range of benefits for women, the empirical evidence base upon which such claims are made is limited. Access to a range of energy services suitable to their enterprise would provide women with building blocks to operate their enterprise, alleviate restrictions on growth, increase their sustainability, and provide them with increased control over enterprise operation. These may help to create an enabling environment for empowerment, rather than directly contributing to it. Consideration of the gendered dynamics and logics of entrepreneurship in the design of development interventions, in particular with regard to motivations for operating an enterprise, spatial distribution of enterprises, growth strategies and risk behaviour, may lead to more sustainable and empowered enterprises in the long-term.",Volume 28,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/28/suppl/C,22
"Geothermal Energy is regarded an important element of many future scenarios of 100% renewable energy. Besides biomass, hydrodams and wave plants, geothermal can provide a steady base load of energy. While the technology received little attention compared to wind or solar for most of its history, this has significantly changed in Germany in recent years. Since an earthquake attributed to geothermal development in Swiss Basel in 2006, a risk discourse evolved in German language media reports. Subsequently local protest groups have been founded that establish a new environmental protest movement. According to the theory of vested interests (Kousis, 1993; Schnaiberg, 1993) and socially constructed risk perceptions (Douglas and Wildavsky, 1982) the future development of deep geothermal technologies will continue to be accompanied by strong conflicts of acceptance, that are likely to slow down its dissemination significantly.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"It is often stated that people do not desire energy itself but the ‘energy services’ it provides. Despite its importance, initial searches revealed no obviously dominant definitions of the term ‘energy services’, and inconsistent illustrative examples. This paper presents the results of a content analysis and literature review which aimed to answer the question: ‘what are energy services?’. One hundred and eighty-five articles from the journals Energy Policy and Energy Research and Social Science containing the term “energy service*” in the title, abstract or keywords were analysed, and additional documents relevant to the concept were identified for review. In total, 27 definitions of ‘energy services’ were recorded, and 173 separate examples (such as ‘space heating’ or ‘lighting’). Thematic analysis of the definitions revealed a number of recurring themes, such as ‘useful energy/work’ and the provision of ‘benefits’ to people. Previous literature suggested the importance of distinguishing between ‘energy services’ and the ‘end services or states’ which they help obtain. On the basis of the identified themes, examples and conceptual discussion, the following definition of ‘energy services’ is proposed: Energy services are those functions performed using energy which are means to obtain or facilitate desired end services or states.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"The social conflict over the development of wind facilities is evidence of a new type of environmental controversy. One side of the argument is composed of wind proponents who advocate the environmental benefits of wind energy to tackle climate change and secure energy sources. On the other side of the argument are the opponents who are concerned with potential health and ecological impacts. Although wind has become a contributor to the energy mix in Ontario, Canada there remains a significant and organized resistance to wind power development in the province. This paper serves to identify the factors that can lead to social acceptance of wind project development, and applies a conceptual framework for encouraging more effective public participation. Employing the case study methodology, representatives of key stakeholder groups in five Ontario wind projects were interviewed. The results of this study indicate that community engagement in Ontario wind project approvals remains limited and explains, to some degree, the ongoing resistance to these projects. Stakeholders were however, broadly supportive of the authors proposed conceptual participatory framework, which encourages a collaborative approach in the approval process. Also, all stakeholder groups welcomed the notion of a knowledge-broker to assist in the decision-making process.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"Energy policy research has highlighted systematic shortfalls in the adoption of new energy technologies owing to market failures and behavioral factors. However, less research has examined how organizational processes may block energy innovations. In this paper, we propose that a key organizational obstacle in the adoption of innovations may be the lack of a good justification for implementing a technology. In situations where there is no obviously correct answer regarding the adoption of an innovation, organizations put a premium on developing a justification that may be favorably received in the context of an organization’s energy culture. Absent a favorable justification an organization may abandon a new technology, or delay implementing it until a suitable justification becomes available. We draw our insights about the role of justifications in organizations from a study of the U.S. Navy’s decade-long attempt to justify LED lighting on its ships. LED lighting proponents in the Navy cycled through several justifications for the technology with little success. We conclude that a better appreciation of the organizational processes involved in justifying new energy investments is essential for the development of more effective energy policy.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"Recent literature states the importance of using behavioral science to address the persistent gaps between the technical potential of low carbon technologies and the actual adoption of these technologies. With the goal of addressing this important gap, in this study we investigate the efficacy of serious games – games with a primary purpose other than entertainment – to overcome informational and perceptive barriers to broader adoption of solar energy in the residential sector. Using a randomized control trial design with playing a trivia-style game as the treatment condition, we assess the impact of serious games on effecting behavioral antecedents toward solar energy in residential energy customers, applying the Theory of Planned Behavior (attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control). Our findings indicate that serious games are effective in bridging the information gap and enabling participants to feel agency, warranting further investigation of the effectiveness of this intervention strategy on behavioral change applied at large scale.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"I expand and integrate a theory of mobility (Automobility) with one of science and technology (Actor Network Theory) and one about social acceptance and user adoption (UTAUT). I apply this integrative framework to the diffusion (and non-diffusion) of electric vehicles and the process of electric mobility. I begin by presenting my methods, namely semi-structured qualitative research interviews with social theorists. Then, I present the three theories deemed most relevant by respondents. Automobility holds that, on a cultural or social level, automobiles exist as part of a complex, one that involves hardware and infrastructure—a hybridity between drivers and machines—along with patterns of identity and attitudes about driving pleasure. Actor Network Theory (ANT) involves the concepts of network assemblage, translation, enrollment, and actants and lieutenants. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, or UTAUT, states that on an individual level, the adoption of new technologies will be predicated on interconnected factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and other facilitating conditions. Based largely on the original interview data supplemented with peer-reviewed studies, I propose a conceptual framework of user acceptance consisting of motile pleasure, sociality, sociotechnical commensurability, and habitual momentum. I conclude with implications for research and policy.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"Consumer demand is an important aspect of a successful transition to low-carbon technology—where consumers must have basic awareness and understanding of a technology in order to purchase and use it. In this study we explore consumer knowledge, confusion and perceptions for two related technology cases: plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and a program that allows the electric utility to control the timing of PEV charging to support renewable electricity. We focus on “Mainstream” vehicle buyers, who differ from the first PEVs buyers. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 new-vehicle buying households in the greater Vancouver area of British Columbia, Canada. Overall, participant awareness was very low for both technologies; most participants were confused about hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology and did not understand the sources of electricity that PEVs might consume. Once the case technologies were explained, most participants expressed a wide range of positive and negative perceptions of both, which we categorize into a framework of perceived functional (e.g. cost and performance), symbolic (e.g. “strangeness” and loss of control), or societal (e.g. pollution reduction) attributes. We conclude with suggestions of how research and policy can consider and further examine the roles of knowledge and perceptions in markets for low-carbon technologies.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"In this article we empirically study the notion of ‘The Resource Man’ put forward by Strengers (2014): a motivated and knowledgeable micro-resource manager, who uses domestic smart grid innovations to manage energy demand in a sustainable, affordable and grid-friendly way. To explore this notion, we analyse a case study where energy cooperative members engaged with an ICT-based monitoring platform focussing on three domestic energy-managing activities – energy monitoring, planning and sharing. We find that although this case provided the best prerequisites for the Resource Man to emerge, none of these activities was sustained during the project. This outcome underlines that the Resource Man perspective held by many actors in the energy industry has a narrow understanding of energy consumption and how it can be changed or made more flexible. We suggest that it is easier to understand householders’ engagement with energy through the concept of energy practice or “e-practices”. E-practices go beyond managing energy with smart devices, and can include being actively involved in an energy collective, generating, trading, storing or discussing energy. We argue that in general, domestic smart grid technology can play a potential but limited role in effecting changes to complex and interlinked daily practices.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"Will everybody want and have a refrigerator, television and washing machine as incomes rise? Considerable uncertainty surrounds the likely increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions from rising incomes among the world's poor. We examine drivers of and predict appliance ownership using machine learning and other techniques with household survey data in India, South Africa and Brazil. Televisions and refrigerators are consistently preferred over washing machines. Income is still the predominant driver of aggregate penetration levels, but its influence differs by appliance and by region. The affordability of appliances, wealth, race and religion together, among other household characteristics, help explain the heterogeneity in appliance ownership at lower income levels. Understanding non-income drivers can be helpful to identify barriers to appliance uptake and to better forecast near term residential energy demand growth within countries.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"A large body of literature suggests that households could save money by increasing the level of energy efficiency of the energy-using durables they purchase – a so-called “energy efficiency gap”. High implicit discount rates estimated from purchases of energy-using durables have generally been interpreted as evidence of such an energy efficiency gap. However, the “discounting gap” between econometrically estimated discount rates and risk-adjusted market interest rates commonly presented in the literature is caused by different factors not all of which portray privately suboptimal purchase decisions by households. In particular, the discounting gap overstates the size of an energy efficiency gap in the choice between efficient and inefficient durables because of estimation and interpretation flaws. This article reviews the factors potentially explaining the observation of a discounting gap in the purchase of energy-using durables. It separates the factors only contributing to a discounting gap from the ones causing an energy efficiency gap to reveal a discrepancy between the size of the estimated discounting gap and the empirical findings of privately inefficient behavior by households.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"Nuclear energy is one of the cornerstones of the contemporary Czech energy policy. In the country of ten million people, six commercial reactors are on line and two to four new units have been envisaged by recent official documents. The Czechs seem to be committed to nuclear despite the contemporary trends in both the regional and European energy policies, which clearly favor renewable and/or more flexible conventional sources. In this article we examine the main drivers behind the Czech Republic's enduring interest in nuclear energy. The main line of reasoning is informed by Jack Snyder's strategic culture concept, which stresses cultural factors and factors related to the structural characteristics of a country's decision-making process in explaining how concrete policies come into existence. Since such a perspective is rather rare in the field of energy policy analysis, the broader aim of this article is to attract more scientific attention to explanations that go beyond standard techno-economical or systemic analyses.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"The implementation of theoretically designed low carbon energy transitions provided by scientific policy advice proves to be challenging in practice. For the case of Germany prominent rhetoric frontlines separate proponents of centralized and decentralized solutions for decarbonizing its electricity infrastructure. This paper investigates whether the claim that incumbent actors favor centralized and challengers decentralized solutions finds supporting evidence on a small sample of practitioners from different fields of the German electricity system. It further aims to identify qualitative infrastructure scenarios for its long-term future based on the practitioners’ mental models of system effects. We find empirical evidence for the postulated claim; yet there are no clear-cut camps. Disagreements across elicited mental models of practitioners from the same fields render the identification of internally consistent scenarios impossible for the full sample. The largest possible subsamples lead to three related visions of a substantially transformed electricity system dominated by decentral, small and medium-scale solutions coexisting with some centralized, large-scale infrastructures. The strong heterogeneity in preferences and mental models we uncover leads us to conclude that transparent and participatory public discourse on underlying worldviews, norms and values is paramount for accelerating institutional reform paving the way for energy transitions in Germany and globally.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"Recent studies in the field of political science and environmental resource governance suggest that oil-exporting economies have begun to implement fuel subsidy reforms. However, while most studies on this issue focus largely on the broader environmental and economic consequences of fuel subsidy reforms, few have examined specifically the effects on renewable energy transitions. Drawing insights from the literature on political economy and the multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions, with empirical examples from Nigeria, first this study provides an explanation of which factors triggered fuel reforms on the basis of the interaction between landscape and regime elements and second the effects of such fuel reforms on renewable energy transitions. Findings suggest that landscape factors such as global oil crashes and pressures from international financial organisations played crucial roles in the drive for fuel reforms. Nonetheless, rentier regime members responded to these pressures by adopting institutional, discursive and redistributive measures. Of all three strategies, the institutional strategy was significantly pivotal in the proliferation of renewable energy in Nigeria. This study concludes by discussing lessons learned in shaping a transition away from fossil fuels in Nigeria and rentier countries in general.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"The paper analyzes the historical evolution of the production of liquid bioenergy in the US on the basis of the political economy of fuels for road transport, largely determined by the dynamics of the opportunity cost that arises from the connection between energy and agricultural markets. We have developed an analysis framework to build a set of scenarios suitable to explain the evolution of biofuel markets in the historical period analyzed. These scenarios, strongly associated with conditions of convergence and conflict between the regulatory state and the agro-industry, have then been statistically verified using an interrupted time series analysis. The analysis shows that the evolution of governance, institutions, and markets around bioenergy have been determined not just by the political goals of the US regulatory state, but also by private economic drivers related to agro-industry. This suggests that bioenergy transition in the US can be understood as the agricultural dimension of the political economy that underlies the socio-technical regime of energy for transport in the US, characterized by institutional inertia and technological lock-in.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"Energy security is currently one of the priorities in governmental agendas, particularly for fast-growing economies such as Turkey. These economies which typically depend on energy-intense industrial production require a consistent, reliable supply of energy to support their economic development, especially the ones with limited indigenous energy resources. As the Industrial sector plays a major role in energy demand, the successful implementation of energy security strategy also depends on the cooperation of intensive energy consuming industrial companies. Therefore, this paper investigates the interrelationship between Turkish industry’s perspective and government’s energy security strategy papers, providing a case with the potential to enlighten the process. It also aims to gain insight into the industry sector’s view of the energy security in this context, through a qualitative inquiry. An analysis of resulting concepts, and the interaction and interrelation among these enable the development of a Turkish energy security framework based on the views of industrial sector. In addition, a set of policy recommendations are developed following this framework.

"Patents constitute an important economic mechanism incentivising the development of technologies. Given the immediacy of the need for global access to effective emission cutting technologies, the role of patents requires further consideration in the general climate change mitigation discourse. This paper aims to address this issue, presenting arguments on the role of the patent system from general intellectual property literature, as well as insights from specialized technological fields. The authors find that although patents provide a strong economic incentive for innovation, they limit the further commercialization of mitigation technologies based on previously patented materials and thus hinder global access to mitigation solutions. Development of mitigation technologies, specifically of renewable energies and carbon capture storage, requires predominantly an improvement of existing technologies. Therefore, patents are seen to restrict development and are perceived as an obstacle to climate change mitigation. In order to achieve the targets set by COP21, the transfer of patented technologies is a necessity. However, patents are found to act as one factor that can severely restrict the dissemination of technologies globally. Given these findings, the merits of open-source/copy-left systems of intellectual property deserve further study, especially with regard to their applicability to climate change mitigation solutions.",Volume 27,May 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/27/suppl/C,23
"Against the backdrop of the transformation of the German energy system, a new dynamic is emerging between the previously separate economic fields of renewable energy systems, transportation, and information and communication technologies (ICT). The trend towards digitalization and interconnectivity is prompting the formation of new corporate alliances and business ideas. We argue that the increasing interactions between actors in these sectors are evidence of the emergence of a new intersectoral field. Building on concepts from neoinstitutionalism, particularly, the framework of strategic action fields (SAF), we examine the overlaps and dynamics that are arising in an exemplar of what policy makers and planners often refer to as “living labs.” With help of this case study we observe the cross-field innovation activities taking place at a particular local site. Our empirical examination draws upon a four-year-long ethnography of an innovation campus in Berlin, the German capital. This case reveals the development of interdependent interests and collaborations between both different industries and between companies and academic institutions.

"A diagnosis for why the social sciences have limited impact on energy policy-making is proposed, and the outline of a remedy presented. The diagnosis identifies the limited use physical science in social studies of energy as a major cause of this lack of impact. This is illustrated by a qualitative review of studies in psychological and sociological approaches and by a quantitative content analysis of all the articles published in Energy Research and Social Science to July 2016. Only around one in ten papers make any meaningful reference to common physical units for energy analysis, with nearly three-quarters making no reference at all to any of these units, in contrast to the pattern observed in the journal Energy Policy. This is important because while it is possible to make realistic but problematic energy policy with only physical and technical data it is not possible to make realistic energy policy with only social data. To bring more physics into social science of energy without the latter simply serving the framework of the former demands a new socio-technical approach to the study of energy.

"This paper explores the broad question of how non-economic social science can become more influential in energy transitions by influencing policy or by other means. It distinguishes “pure” social science energy research (SSER) that seeks fundamental understanding of human interactions with energy systems and which is not appropriately judged by practical influence from applied SSER. Several streams of applied SSER investigate topics that are self-evidently important to energy transitions and can have impact without referencing energy units, but SSER on important topics such as household energy consumption, for which the outcome variables are inherently measured in energy units, needs to put energy first to have practical impact. SSER priorities in such areas should be guided by two principles: selecting research topics (1) with large potential for change in energy terms and (2) for which social science concepts can add explanatory value beyond what can be achieved by concepts from other fields. For various reasons, SSER in this area has typically ignored principle 1. Following it is necessary but not sufficient for greater practical influence.

"I reflect on three issues in light of Adam Cooper’s paper: the logic of relationships between physical and social sciences; the place of Schatzkian practice theory (SPT) here regarding energy research; and historical contingencies that bring different research and policy challenges in different epochs. The basic subject matter of physical science is inanimate materiality that is blindly subject to causal chains that are predictable, at least in principle, whereas humans are conscious agents who can initiate causality unpredictably. Nevertheless, studies of human action can give somewhat orderly results using either statistics or heuristics. SPT enables us to produce useful heuristics that link different domains of reality, and this can enable parameters of physics to be quantified in novel ways and, importantly, with a human face. But no matter how neat our theoretical rigor, we need to adapt our approaches to address historical contingencies – such as today’s rapidly growing disparity between the richest 1% and the rest of us. Further, there is an important place for non-quantitative insights into humanity’s journey towards a better life for all.

"Single-discipline research may have limited effectiveness if it fails to take into account cogent knowledge from other fields, and especially if fails to communicate using terms that are meaningful to other disciplines and to policy makers. In the energy field, interdisciplinary research is needed to address the many complex and urgent socio-technical issues involved in achieving a more sustainable future. However, the terminology and specialised concepts that are integral to disciplines can create barriers to a comprehensive understanding of a shared field of inquiry. In energy sciences the common language of mathematics is used to help in understanding of the quantitative concepts of energy and its transformations, while the social sciences use both qualitative and quantitative means to describe society and social relationships, using the subtly different languages that are associated with different social theories. If these barriers to communication can be bridged, the benefits can be immense. I illustrate some of the misunderstandings that can occur in conversations between social and physical scientists with an imaginary dialogue. I conclude that, to work effectively across disciplines, social scientists will need to learn something of what energy means, and physical scientists will need to learn something of what energy means.",Volume 26,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/26/suppl/C,24

This paper summarizes the policy implications of a recent analysis that builds on the literature of the integration of renewable electricity, electric vehicles and electric heat by modeling and testing nearly 86 million different combinations of wind, solar, natural gas, vehicle-to-grid capable electric vehicles, and electric heat. After each system was modeled for four years of operation to ensure reliability, the costs of energy systems were then calculated both with and without externalities to better understand how this cost affects implementation. We present the results and policy implications of our analysis across the 86 million energy systems and conclude with the role of social science in future research.",Volume 26,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/26/suppl/C,24
"The European Commission’s so-called ‘Winter Package of energy legislation will provide the framework for energy policy in the European Union for many years to come. It contains proposals for a whole range of energy-related issues including energy markets, energy infrastructure, renewable energy, climate policy and also energy demand. In this paper, we carry out a preliminary review of the proposals and what they mean for energy efficiency. The European Union has adopted the principle of “Efficiency First” through the launch of the Energy Union Communication in February 2015. We assess the extent to which the Winter Package keeps the promise of putting energy efficiency first. More specifically, we analyse the revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive (EPBD) the Directive on common rules for the Internal Energy Market for electricity (IEM), the Regulation on the electricity market, and the Regulation on Governance of the Energy Union. We conclude that, while there are many improvements across the different pieces of legislation, the Winter Package falls short of comprehensively reflecting the Efficiency First principle. The paper provides a number of concrete policy recommendations in order to incorporate the Efficiency First principle more fully into the proposed set of European energy legislation.",Volume 26,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/26/suppl/C,24
"Neighbourhood peer effects (social influence) in the diffusion of residential solar photovoltaics (PV) have previously been identified and quantified in a number of studies. Yet, little has been known about the inner workings of peer effects in PV diffusion. In the present work, a survey and interviews were used to study peer effects among Swedish PV adopters. Participants acknowledged peer effects as important for their adoption decision, although they had in general been seriously contemplating PV adoption before the effects. The main function of peer effects appears to have been a confirmation that PV works as intended and without hassle, rather than the procreation of unexpected insights or the provision of more advanced information. Peer effects had mainly occurred through existing and rather close social relationships, rather than between neighbours that did not already know each other. Peer effects appear to have reduced barriers related to PV attributes such as low trialability and low observability of the actual results of adoption. The results suggest that passive peer effects (through seeing PV) were less important than active effects (through direct interpersonal contact), and that seeing PV rarely led to direct contact with adopters, a finding that contrast somewhat to previous literature.",Volume 26,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/26/suppl/C,24
"This theoretical-review article contributes to the discussion on individual energy savings by developing a hypothetical classification of interventions and linking them to socio-psychological factors affecting the transition points of four phases of behavior change (predecision, preaction, action, and postaction). It helps to segment a population into subgroups, clarifies the dynamic process for individuals, and groups examples of interventions to achieve substantial behavioral change. The generic integrative model presents academic study designers and practitioners with a theoretical viewpoint and an orientation framework for their intervention designs. A systematic literature review of the empirical evidence for the model and interventions is presented. This blueprint of a model can be adapted, specified, further developed and implemented as a backbone for empirically-grounded intervention design.",Volume 26,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/26/suppl/C,24
"Low-income households comprise an important, but often-neglected, target population for energy reduction in the U.S. residential sector. Previous research of this population tends to emphasize demographic and economic factors with little consideration of social-psychological variables. This paper utilized the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to investigate how demographics, climate zones, and a set of social-psychological variables, including energy concern, bill consciousness, frugality attitude, and thermal comfort (needs for coolness and warmness) influenced energy conservation intentions among 248 low-income households across the U.S. Results indicated that the three TPB variables alone (attitudes toward energy- conservation, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) had positive effects on energy conservation intentions. Attitudes toward energy-conservation and perceived behavioral control remained as the strongest predictors after accounting for other variables. Meanwhile, bill consciousness positively predicted energy conservation intentions, whereas needs for warmness and coolness negatively predicted intentions. Gender and climate zones predicted intentions when other variables were not included in the model. This study provides important insights on low-income households’ energy-conservation intentions, as well as the antecedents and potential barriers, which provide useful recommendations for future energy policy initiatives.",Volume 26,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/26/suppl/C,24
"Since the early 2000s, the U.S. has experienced a rapid increase in domestic unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD). Continuing a legacy as an oil and gas producing state, Colorado has emerged as a leader in this development. Yet these extraction practices have created a burden for municipal governments who have had little to no previous exposure to oil and gas development and were thus unprepared to regulate it. Through the application of a strategic action field (SAF) theoretical framework, this paper examines the processes through which local governments—Fort Collins and Loveland, Colorado—have pursued divergent strategies to regulate UOGD in their city limits, and the extent to which collective incumbents and challengers in the broader field environment have wielded meaning making practices and other resources to influence these strategies. To explore this understudied area of the governance process, I primarily draw from qualitative interviews with city staff and council members. Results suggest that both meaning making and power are critical components of strategic field action, and that the social skill of meaning making is in itself a form of power.",Volume 26,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/26/suppl/C,24
"Questions abound about the appropriate governance systems to manage the risks of unconventional oil and gas development, and the ability for citizens to engage and participate in those systems. In this paper, we map the development of shale gas governance in the US and UK; we highlight the contrasting systems of land ownership and mineral rights, compare the opportunities that these systems of governance present the general public to participate and become involved in shale gas decisions and consider the implications on issues of social justice.We conclude that in both countries, that despite government and industry engagement rhetoric and associated processes, the publics’ influence on shale gas decisions is perceived to be minimal or not at all. We argue that the implications of the observed institutional governance systems, with few opportunities for citizen influence, are developments which inherently lack social justice, procedural fairness, and ultimately, a social license to operate.",Volume 26,April 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/26/suppl/C,24
"Global environmental health efforts are motivated by a sense of common responsibility. These programs take forms small and large, from community churches to the World Bank. The methods likewise take varying, and sometimes competing forms, from watershed restoration to road building to community engagement, with funding provided by charities, bilateral aid, loans, microfinance and big business. Once these projects are installed, typically the implementers are their own evaluators. Under the best of circumstances, sometimes funding is available to run a randomized controlled trial to rigorously evaluate if the projects are improving the intended environmental, economic, health or other metrics. But, usually sooner rather than later, the funding runs out for that particular project, and everyone moves on. This has resulted in sad statistics. For example, half of the water pumps installed in some African countries are broken a few years after they’re installed. In a recent volume, Broken Pumps and Promises – Incentivizing Impact in Environmental Health[1] my co-authors and I review alternatives. Instead of pushing money toward projects based on promises, pay interventions for successfully demonstrating impact that meets this intent.

"Energy in India has a big data problem – the world’s second most populous and fastest growing large economy does not have a singular central body in charge of maintaining and disseminating India’s energy data, let alone analyzing it. Different pockets of data come from different bodies, some statutory, but these lack granularity and timeliness, even before we get to the challenges of data completeness, accuracy, and differences in methodology and assumptions. We propose that India should create a national Energy Information Agency – an Indian EIA or “indEIA.” India urgently needs a dedicated, central agency to collect, collate, disseminate, and facilitate the analysis of all essential energy-related data. An entity like indEIA will be critical in helping India leverage the creative powers of the national and international analyst community to provide reliable, cost-effective, and clean energy to its citizens.

"Cross-disciplinary research is essential in understanding and reducing energy usage, however the reality of this collaboration comes with many challenges. This paper provides an insight into the integration of social science in energy research, drawing on the expertise and first hand experiences of a range of social science researchers (predominantly Early Career Researchers (ECRs)) working on UK cross-disciplinary projects in energy demand. These researchers, participants in a workshop dedicated to understanding the integration of social science in energy research, identified four groups of challenges to successful integration: Differing expectations of the role of social scientists; Working within academia; Feeling like a valued member of the team; and Communicating and comprehension between disciplines. Suggestions of how to negotiate those challenges included: Management and planning; Increasing contact; Sharing experience; and Understanding team roles. The paper offers a definition of ‘success’ in cross-disciplinary energy research from the perspective of social science ECRs, comprising external, internal and personal components. Using the logics of interdisciplinarity, this paper suggests that integration of the social sciences in the projects discussed may be partial at best and highlights a need to recognise the challenges ECRs face, in order to achieve full integration and equality of disciplines.",Volume 25,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/25/suppl/C,25
"The relation between wind power development and local communities has received considerable attention in literature and practice. Relatively few studies, however, have provided evidence about how local citizens perceive enduring environmental impacts such as aviation obstruction lights installed on wind turbines or on wind farm light masts. Evidence regarding people’s perceived annoyance over obstruction lights is of increasing importance as wind turbines become taller, thus potentially affecting more people in the future. The paper conducts individual web-based surveys and interviews with local residents around the world’s largest onshore test site for tall wind turbines in Denmark – the national test site in the rural area of Østerild. The aim is to explore the nature and extent of perceived annoyance over aviation obstruction lights from the test site and the efficiency of different coping strategies. In particular, the discussion focuses on the perceived annoyance in relation to the perceived changes in sense of place, hereunder the loss of the area’s unique night darkness. We argue that perceived annoyance can only be mitigated through coping strategies to a limited extent, as a) perceived effects on sense of place are distinctive in shaping annoyance, and b) an internalisation of planning-related inequities persists.",Volume 25,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/25/suppl/C,25
"This study investigated a set of social-psychological predictors affecting smart meter support and adoption intention based on the Technology Acceptance and Sustainable Energy Technology Acceptance Models among 711 U.S. residents. Despite low levels of adoption in the U.S., this study suggested that the majority of our participants supported smart meter technology and were willing to adopt this technology. Two perceived technology attributes – usefulness and risk to privacy – had direct effects on support for smart meter installation and adoption intention, while the other technology attribute, perceived cost, had no impact. Individual differences in trust in one’s utility company and problem perception related to energy issues affected support and adoption intention through the mediators of perceived usefulness and privacy risk. Problem perception also had direct effects on support and adoption intention. Democrats reported higher levels of trust in utility companies and problem perception than non-Democrats.

"In this paper we explore the interaction between new “smart” energy feedback technologies and households. Based on in-depth qualitative video interviews with participants in two smart grid demonstration projects, the paper analyses how smart technology become integrated in the day-to-day activities of these households – how they interpreted and understood the technology, and how the technology became interwoven in processes of social learning. We have identified four kinds of relational re-arrangements that the feedback caters for: knowledge re-arrangements, material re-arrangements, social re-arrangements and routine re-arrangements. The re-arrangements illustrate how the technologies’ affordances open up for certain kinds transformative action, while sealing off options for others. The exercise points to some radical design challenges, and we suggest seeing both technology design and electricity use as situated practice in need of infrastructural support.",Volume 25,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/25/suppl/C,25

This paper aims to assess how dependent energy-related social practices in the household are in relation to the time of the day. It analyses the 2005 UK Office for National Statistics National Time Use Survey making use of statistically-derived time dependence metrics for six social practice: preparing food, washing, cleaning, washing clothes, watching TV and using a computer. The focus is on social practices over temporal scales of different days of the week and months of the year. The main findings show that: washing has the highest value for the time dependence metric; using computers is the least time-dependent practice; Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays have the highest time dependence for all practices; and certain energy-related practices have higher seasonal dependence than others.",Volume 25,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/25/suppl/C,25
"Smart grid research in Denmark has increasingly turned its focus on aggregator trading flexibility achieved by remotely controlling appliances, studying the technologies involved rather than the control. This paper investigates how different types of control were envisioned and designed for a two-year smart grid trial in Denmark with 20 private households. Using the notion of script, processes of in- and de-scription were used to gain insights into perceived and enacted control. Based on empirical data from 26 interviews and three workshops, we show how the in-scription process of control can be characterized as dynamic and includes negotiations between the residents and those responsible for the project. Second, we show how users de-script control, and third, we outline the project owners’ reaction to the user’s de-scription of control.The design of the remote control appears to have promoted a preference for ‘passive consumers' within a smart grid. This design prompts questions about how the users in smart grid development are envisioned and configured using different ideas about control. With current development and the need for additional energy reductions, consumers who invest in photovoltaic solar cells and electric vehicles lose interest in delivering their energy to the system level.",Volume 25,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/25/suppl/C,25
"Increased household adoption of solar photovoltaic systems has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with providing electricity. Although residential solar has recently become more affordable, market penetration in the U.S. remains relatively low. This study proposes a theoretical framework for investigating the psychological and social determinants of interest in residential solar drawn from three theories that may explain the decision to pursue it: diffusion of innovations theory, theory of planned behavior, and value-belief-norm theory. We test this framework using survey data from 904 non- adopter homeowners, with the aim of identifying potential levers for intervention. Overall, we find that consumers see solar electricity in multiple ways: as an environmental benefit, a consumer good, and an innovative technology. Notably, individuals who trust installers and believe solar will be personally beneficial are more likely to consider contacting an installer, as are individuals drawn to novel products. Proenvironmental personal norms indirectly increase interest through perceived personal benefits, suggesting that marketing efforts aimed at environmentally-concerned individuals may need to emphasize non-environmental benefits. The results also support leveraging trusted social networks to convey the benefits of solar. We conclude by discussing the value of the integrated framework along with implications for policymakers and marketers.",Volume 25,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/25/suppl/C,25
"This paper explores citizen participation in Swedish and Finnish regulatory processes for final disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Finland and Sweden are considered the most advanced worldwide in term of SNF disposal plans. Our aim is to analyze the institutional waste management frameworks, focusing on the role of civil society organizations (CSOs); how lay-people and civil society organizations have been able to participate and contribute to radioactive waste licensing processes; and the nature of radioactive waste risk debates. We review official documents of the waste companies and nuclear safety authorities, plus information from civil society organizations and laypeople. Our theoretical framework takes a civil regulation perspective, which is oriented towards institutional issues. The analysis indicates that civil regulation of SNF is better established in Sweden than in Finland because of institutional arrangements and the more controversial nature of nuclear power. Swedish civil regulation resembles a more liberal approach, whereas in the Finnish case technocratic domination is more evident and therefore CSOs have been left to choose critical, confrontational and antagonist civil regulation strategies producing dispersed and random civil regulation. We conclude that due to differences in civil regulation there is not a Nordic model for SNF disposal.",Volume 25,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/25/suppl/C,25
"Cities around the world have set climate change mitigation targets, yet actions to implement these targets have so far proved inadequate. Better methodology is needed to support this impetus for action. Problem structuring methods (PSMs) enable improvements to be made in wicked problem situations; they appear to have potential to improve climate change mitigation actions but they are difficult to carry out in highly pluralist problem contexts. A case study (STEEP) that applied a PSM to support low-carbon urban energy master planning in three cities is presented. The STEEP methodology was effective in reducing the wickedness of the problem but issues of a lack of clarity on problem ownership and lack of interessement were seen. A reflective boundary critique study found that there was a mismatch between power and interest amongst key stakeholders towards the low-carbon vision. Three key issues identified in the case study were discussed through the lens of critical systems thinking: (i) the need for new competencies, (ii) dealing with wickedness, and (iii) behavioural complexity and discordant reference systems. The paper suggests how these issues might be improved through the application of non-PSM theories which can support the use of PSMs in improving city-level climate change mitigation.",Volume 25,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/25/suppl/C,25
"Science, Technology and Society (STS) research on the social dimensions of technology development emphasizes how imagined publics who play passive roles in technology systems influence technology design and public engagement. It further documents expert adherence to deficit models for conceptualizing publics’ responses to technology development. Building on this literature, this paper examines two related questions that have received little attention. First, how do experts conceptualize publics whose direct participation with technology development, rather than quiescence toward technology development, is framed by experts as mandatory for the technology project’s success? Second, given both the prevalence and problematic outcomes of expert and institutional adherence to deficit models, what might an alternative model for conceptualizing publics look like? To address these questions, we draw from a case study of 30 “bioenergy experts” in the Northeastern U.S. and their imagined landowning publics. Our analysis provides two contributions. First, we develop the concept “obligatory publics” to examine expert imaginaries of publics whose direct participation is seen as mandatory for successful renewable energy technology (RET) development. And second, we suggest a “hermeneutic-dialectic” approach, which emphasizes the role of dialogue between experts and publics for achieving new and mutually agreed upon understandings, as one possible alternative to public deficit models.",Volume 25,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/25/suppl/C,25
"Energy policies are increasingly focused on promoting the transition towards a more sustainable energy system. Evidence-based decision-making regarding such policies needs a solid knowledge foundation.

We point to several types of problems and challenges related to achieving a statistical overview of investments in the energy sector, and argue that addressing these problems is not simply a matter of intensifying existing statistical efforts and improving precision because they are caused by fundamental difficulties. We particularly emphasize the role of investors as a linkage between public policy and firm-level activity, discussing the kind of data needed to sufficiently identify investors and their activities and fulfil their particular information needs related to investing in the RE sector.

The tension between the hope expressed by “atoms for peace” and the fear symbolized by a mushroom cloud remains at the heart of contemporary political debates regarding the future of nuclear energy. This tension results in countervailing rhetorical and social fault-lines that undermine the political consensus necessary to generate meaningful action to address arguably the two most significant threats facing the international community today: climate change and nuclear security, including nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism.","Volume 24, Pages 1-106 (February 2017)",February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/24/suppl/C,26
"From the late 1980s, the natural gas extraction in the Netherlands has experienced an increasing number of ever stronger gasquakes (induced earthquakes due to gas extraction). This paper offers a security analysis of the accompanying debate on the material consequences and organization of the gas extraction between the threatened local population, the knowledge institutes analyzing the gasquakes, and the government and extraction industry. This paper studies how these parties make sense of the gasquakes through a combination of securitization theory and the flat relationality offered by new materialism, which forces the two conflicting securitization claims to be analyzed in their local sociotechnical and material context. The resulting analysis shows how the gas debate is structured by a shared security of supply understanding. An understanding which for a long time has been questioned by the local population on its safety and cost implications. However, it took 25 years until their claims were accepted and the security of supply understanding shifted to a focus on minimal extraction volumes. An acceptance that can only be explained through a self-reinforcing combination of security claims, actual material events, increasing measurements (following security calls), shifting value judgements and increasing audience acceptance (creating additional speech actors).","Volume 24, Pages 1-106 (February 2017)",February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/24/suppl/C,26
"Much focus has been placed in public policy discourses on defining energy security as independence from reliance on external hydrocarbon fuels. This definition provides little guidance about the benefits and risks to energy security from the integration of electrical power systems across nation-state lines. Instead of assuming energy independence is intrinsically more secure, this paper argues for utilizing a multi-dimensional energy security framework for evaluating electricity integration by evaluating perceptions of the energy security for shallow and deep electricity integration for Morocco. It argues that conceiving of Moroccan policymaker’s energy security goals only in terms of energy independence misunderstands the broader sustainable development and human security context of Morocco’s renewable electricity plans and overlooks its motivations for increasing electricity interdependence. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for global governance geared toward improving the security of transnational grids. First, electricity integration offers numerous energy security benefits, but these benefits could be negated if technological integration lacks a strong political foundation. Second, policymakers should distinguish between dependence and interdependence and prioritize the latter. Third, given the urgency of climate change, pollution, and energy poverty challenges, decision-makers should approach energy security, human security, and sustainable development as inseparable challenges.","Volume 24, Pages 1-106 (February 2017)",February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/24/suppl/C,26
"Why did the United States (US) lift its forty-year old oil export ban in 2015? Press coverage has offered various answers, such as the decline in crude oil prices and the rise of US tight oil production. Yet, these explanations are incomplete. Prices have declined in the past without a policy change and, in spite of the shale revolution, the US remains a net oil importer. Here, we argue that the repeal of the ban was driven by the confluence of multiple streams in the policy process: a policy problem created by the spread between US and international crude prices, a policy solution advocated by a constituency with growing voice and power, and a window of opportunity offered by falling international oil prices and the budget deal in late 2015. The analysis is a reminder that the policy process behind ostensibly rational energy policies is often less coherent than might be assumed.","Volume 24, Pages 1-106 (February 2017)",February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/24/suppl/C,26
"Much of the debate over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action—the agreement on Iran’s nuclear program reached in 2015 between the P5 + 1 and Iran–has centered on whether the limits the plan imposes on Iran's nuclear program are sufficient to prevent Iran from achieving a nuclear “breakout” in a year or less. However, “breakout time” is misleading: it involves implausible worst-case assumptions and ignores important factors influencing Iran's nuclear path. It also overlooks important elements of the agreement such as safeguards and transparency measures that likely do the most to prevent Iran from getting a weapon. Why, then has breakout time occupied such a central position in the debate? This paper argues this case is an example of how the over-reliance on technical threat estimates biases policy debates. Technical assessments are critical to understanding threats, but when removed from the political and strategic context can fuel worst-case estimates. Moreover,they create an illusion of precision and certainty that leads policy makers and the public to overlook important areas of uncertainty and factors that can impact policy outcomes that are difficult to measure or are not easily quantified.","Volume 24, Pages 1-106 (February 2017)",February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/24/suppl/C,26
"As China’s dependence on imported oil has soared in recent years, Chinese concerns about energy security have naturally increased. The Chinese government has encouraged China’s National Oil Companies to expand their investments around the world. Some of the high profile cases of state support for these international deals have taken the form of “loan-for-oil” agreements in which Chinese state development banks lend billions of dollars to oil-producing countries at below-market interest rates in exchange for the producers’ agreements to sell oil to Chinese oil companies (at future market prices rather than at a fixed price). Some analysts consider the Chinese investments to be an energy security policy. Using standard financial analysis, we show that these agreements cannot reasonably be considered profit-seeking investments by the Chinese. Separately, we also show that only a few of the projects connected to loan-for-oil deals could ameliorate China’s fear of future political-military supply interruptions, and even in those cases, China could achieve the same energy security benefit through simpler mechanisms. The loan-for-oil deals implicitly suggest that China does not expect future conflict that might block Chinese access to oil imports.","Volume 24, Pages 1-106 (February 2017)",February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/24/suppl/C,26
"The European Internal Energy Market aims to promote trade and competition in electricity generation across the EU, with investment signals for new generation capacity and interconnection coming from zonal electricity prices reflecting scarcity value. However, a growing number of EU Member States have implemented national Capacity Mechanisms in order to ensure future security of supply within their own borders, which may distort the cross-border trade of energy. This local view of energy security is in response to internal technical and economic constraints and a perceived inability of cross-border electricity flows to be a reliable source of capacity at times of maximum stress, in favour of self-sufficiency. A number of routes are available to resolve this conflict through permitting cross-border participation of generators in local Capacity Mechanisms, but this requires resolution of a number of complicating factors, not least a means for properly allocating transmission capacity without introducing further distortions to the energy market. Alternative solutions could be enacted at an EU-level, such as through the alignment of Capacity Mechanisms to a common model, or the introduction of an EU-wide single Capacity Mechanism, but the current regulatory focus appears to remain on resolution of such issues at a national level.","Volume 24, Pages 1-106 (February 2017)",February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/24/suppl/C,26
"This essay explores the link between energy security and the 2014 Ukraine crisis. Whenever there is an international conflict involving a major oil or gas producer, commentators are often quick to assume a direct link, and the Ukraine crisis was no exception. Yet, the various avenues through which energy politics have affected the Ukraine crisis, and vice versa, are not well understood. This paper seeks to shed light on the issue by addressing two specific questions. First, how exactly did energy contribute to the crisis in the region? Second, can energy be wielded as a ‘weapon’ by Russia, the EU, or the US? We find that Russian gas pricing played a crucial role as a context factor in igniting the Ukrainian crisis, yet at the same time we guard against ‘energy reductionism’, that is, the fallacy of attributing all events to energy-related issues. We also note that there are strict limits to the so-called energy weapon, whoever employs it.

"This article evaluates whether the South China Sea’s littoral states can cooperatively manage the region’s contested oil and natural gas resources. By examining historical intergovernmental joint development agreements (JDAs), it argues that the prospects for significant hydrocarbon cooperation are slim under current political conditions, as rival states rarely establish such accords. Moreover, creating JDAs is insufficient to prompt actual co-development of shared oil and gas deposits or improvements in states’ broader relations. Nonetheless, hydrocarbon agreements do have one important positive impact. They prevent resource-related militarized confrontations, thereby reducing the risk of territorial dispute escalation. This incentive, alone, could prompt the South China Sea’s claimant states to negotiate JDAs and third party states to encourage these efforts.","Volume 24, Pages 1-106 (February 2017)",February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/24/suppl/C,26

The first and second sections compare and contrast successive gas wars since 2006, detailing respective dimensions to restraint and costly paralysis experienced by upstream, downstream, and transit states alike. The third part presents an alternative understanding of energy power politics rooted in social network analysis. It probes the validity of new forms of power, influence, and vulnerability in Russia's evolving gas relations with Europe, as derived from ""betweenness centrality"" among emerging infrastructure hubs and the quality of corporate alliances across subregions of Central Europe. This includes cursory examination of the credibility and costliness of disruption related to the flexibility and diffusion of gas relationships into/across the northern and southern parts of Central Europe, as well as the social capital within Gazprom's corporate eco-system that bound Russia's lasting prominence as a supplier in these sub-regions.

"After four years of sometimes contentious negotiations (that at one point required a two-year extension from the U.S. Congress), the United States and Republic of Korea signed a new nuclear cooperation agreement in the summer of 2015. These negotiations caused strain in one of the closest bilateral relationships the U.S. has in Asia – a regional priority for the foreign policy of the Obama administration. This paper examines energy conflict within the confines of an otherwise cooperative and productive partnership. It examines the strategic, technical, economic, and political factors that extended the negotiation period and the creative compromises that led to a final agreement. It then considers the potential pitfalls in implementing the agreement and the implications, in terms of process and substance, for future negotiations regarding civilian nuclear cooperation.","Volume 24, Pages 1-106 (February 2017)",February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/24/suppl/C,26
"Advances in nuclear, biological, and chemical technologies have transformational potential related to the global energy supply chain. At the same time, those advances pose significant security risks because those the same technologies can be diverted for violent purposes. Recognizing this threat, the United Nations Security Council in 2004 took the unprecedented step of invoking its Chapter VII authority to pass Resolution 1540, which obligated all UN members to develop, implement, and report on a comprehensive regulatory system for tracking the production and distribution of technology related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The resolution reflected a new international commitment to preventing the proliferation of WMD and a potentially revolutionary approach to transnational regulation. In contrast to traditional approaches that rely on rigorous third-party monitoring, verification, and enforcement, UNSCR 1540 relies on a more dynamic and iterative process of norm elaboration and dissemination that strengthens the social fabric necessary to react to emerging threats. While UNSCR 1540 faces ongoing challenges, it also holds promise as a model of cooperative governance in particularly complex and sensitive issues, such as those that characterize politics at the energy-security nexus.","Volume 24, Pages 1-106 (February 2017)",February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/24/suppl/C,26
"As career foreign policy practioners, we were asked by a group of academics/political scientists led by North Carolina State University to evaluate a series of papers they had prepared on energy security and the energy and security nexus. The organizers noted that an important stimulus for our invitation was that the academic community was hearing that their work needed to be more policy relevant, that it needed to be more “applicable” to help policy makers make better decisions. So they asked us to join their workshop to help determine how their papers and the arguments within them might better elaborate the value of and means to effect cooperation on energy based on the connection between energy and security. And if so, how to stimulate a sustained dialogue between and among scholars and policy-makers because of the prospect of making better informed policy.","Volume 24, Pages 1-106 (February 2017)",February 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/24/suppl/C,26
"The Organization of the Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC) faces a perfect storm. It is squeezed between the revolution in unconventionals, which has increased the global supply of hydrocarbons and lowered their price, and the prospect of a global peak in oil demand, stemming from climate policies and the falling costs of alternative energy technologies. In the face of these challenges, media commentators have declared the death of OPEC as a cartel. This perspective argues that the claims about OPEC’s demise are misguided for four reasons: (1) OPEC never acted as a cartel, let alone a powerful one; (2) thanks to its cheap production costs, OPEC’s oil will remain competitive in a low-cost environment; (3) the group has always proved to be flexible; and (4) OPEC is still attractive to its member states, most notably as a source of prestige, as is illustrated by the recent re-entries of Indonesia and Gabon. That said, over the longer term OPEC will inevitably need to adapt to a changing external environment. A likely possibility would be for the club to gradually morph from an output-setting cartel into a forum for deliberation and information-sharing.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"The promotion of renewable energy is an essential component of energy and climate policies, but it is increasingly recognized that the transition toward an increased use of renewable energy sources constitutes a complex socio-political process. Policy is manifested in multi-actor networks beyond formal hierarchies and must therefore build on a comprehensive empirical understanding of the local collaboration processes that make investments in renewable energy projects possible. The objectives of this article are to: (a) propose an analytical framework within which the local development processes leading to renewable energy investments can be understood, in particular emphasizing the management of the relevant actor networks; and (b) provide empirical illustrations of the framework based on existing research. The article argues that, based on network management theory, some network structures can be expected to be more successful than others in facilitating renewable energy development, and we recognize the ways in which networks and their structure tend to be placed within certain institutional contexts of rules. By consulting selected research on wind power development at the local level we illustrate the added value of the proposed framework, and outline the seeds of a future research agenda.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"The planned transition from nuclear power to decentralized renewable energy sources in Switzerland requires the modification and expansion of the electricity grid. However, public acceptance of high-voltage power lines (HVPLs) is generally low. Drawing on the importance of affect in the context of technology acceptance, the goal of the present work was to shed light on people’s affective responses to HVPLs, as well as to examine the influence of different siting options. Results of an online study (N = 94) showed that pictures of landscapes featuring HVPLs evoke significantly stronger negative feelings than pictures of the same landscapes without HVPLs. These differences were greater for positively perceived surroundings such as rural landscapes than for negatively perceived surroundings such as urban landscapes. In a second step, an eye tracking study (N = 95) was conducted to validate these findings and gain insights into people’s decision making. Results show that people pay more attention to HVPLs when they are sited in positively perceived landscapes than when they are sited in negatively perceived landscapes. Furthermore, increased attention on HVPLs was related to a more negative affective evaluation of otherwise positively perceived landscapes. The results underline the importance of siting decisions in the context of grid infrastructure projects.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"The growing share of small-scale residential installations in the German PV market has attracted interest in the determinants of household adoption dynamics. While models of technology diffusion are well established in literature, the spatial patterns of household adoption remain understudied. The present paper contributes to this emerging stream of literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of factors governing regional differences in residential PV adoption rates across Germany. The analysis focuses on economic factors, socio-demographic and attitudinal adopter characteristics, and settlement structure. A key characteristic of this paper is its measurement of regional spillover effects between neighboring counties, which might contribute to the geographic clustering of PV systems. The empirical analysis is based on aggregate panel data for 807,969 residential photovoltaic systems across 402 German counties for the time period 2000–2013. The analysis is performed by estimating a diffusion equation using a spatial autoregressive and a spatial error panel model. Results indicate that differences in economic incentives influence the spatial and temporal patterns of PV adoption. Further, socioeconomic status is found to have an impact on PV adoption, but the effect of environmental attitude and settlement structure is ambiguous. Significant spatial spillover effects are found between neighboring counties. These findings imply that there is potential for new policies and business models to increase the geographic and social diversification of PV adoption patterns.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"The importance of grid extension in Europe has risen in the last decade as a result of an aging grid and the energy transition toward a decarbonized electricity sector. While grid extension is claimed as necessary, stakeholder opposition has slowed down this process. To alleviate this tension, increased stakeholder participation is considered as a solution to increase acceptance. The question of stakeholder empowerment is central to participation and it is assumed that higher levels of empowerment improve planning processes. In this paper, we describe, evaluate and compare the planning processes for very high-voltage transmission lines in France and Norway by means of a document analysis. We operationalize the degree of empowerment in three levels: information, consultation and cooperation. The results reveal low stakeholder empowerment that barely rises above the level of consultation. The evaluation of recent projects entailing innovations to enhance stakeholder participation reveals a trend of increasing empowerment levels, especially in the early phases of the planning procedure, i.e. the discussion about the needs for new lines and about the needs of the affected stakeholders. The results suggest that current planning regulations can benefit from high levels of stakeholder empowerment, especially in the early phases of the planning process.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"Smart time of use tariffs are a key part of most government’s strategies to ensure our future electricity supply is clean, affordable and secure – but will consumers be willing to switch to them? This paper presents the results of a survey experiment conducted on a nationally representative sample of 2020 British energy bill payers. The data suggests that over a third of bill payers are in favour of switching to a 3-tiered smart time of use tariff, indicating a sizeable potential market for these tariffs. There is substantial variation in willingness to switch, driven by differences in loss-aversion and ownership of demand flexible appliances rather than standard socio-economic/demographic factors. This is the first time loss-aversion has been measured amongst energy bill payers and the results suggest loss-aversion is likely to stifle consumer uptake; 93% of bill payers are loss-averse (care more about avoiding financial losses than making savings) and loss-averse people are substantially less willing to switch to the time of use tariff (p < 0.001). A randomised control trial finds that loss-framed messages are unlikely to overcome loss-aversion to boost uptake. Marketing campaigns tailored towards electric vehicle owners, who were significantly more willing to switch, could increase uptake during and after the smart meter roll-out.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"To achieve significant energy reductions in buildings, decision-makers can engage occupants in different types of interventions such as information sharing, feedback and social marketing. To improve the effectiveness of these energy saving interventions, this study develops and tests a model which is capable of identifying occupants’ energy use characteristics and the influential factors of their energy use behaviors (e.g., turning off lights when not in use). The consumer segmentation approach from social marketing is adopted to divide occupants into different categories using three metrics: motivation, opportunity and ability. As a result, a set of hypotheses and corresponding measures are identified to study the effect of influential factors on occupants’ energy use characteristics and intentional energy use behaviors. The occupants are then clustered into five main segments that take into account how the occupants will respond to interventions. In the case study, a survey is designed to test the hypotheses and their validity using descriptive statistical analysis and structural equation modeling. The proposed framework is expected to provide decision-makers with useful information to design effective energy saving interventions to reduce overall energy consumption in buildings.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"This paper argues that existing critiques of technical fixes are unable to explain our simultaneous enamourment and distrust with technical fixes, and that to do so, we need a political economy analysis. We develop a critical, theoretically grounded conceptualisation of technical fixes as imagined defensive spatio-temporal fixes of specific political economic regimes, and apply it to the case of geoengineering, or ‘clean fossil’, as an attempted technical fix of the climate change problem. We map the promises of clean fossil as a proposed solution to the problem of climate change in discrete episodes since the 1960s.The paper shows that clean fossil promises have been surprisingly poorly aligned with the neoliberal regime, and explains how they have been moderately stable due to those misalignments. We also show that different liberal capitalisms could be supported by different clean fossil technologies, but also that illiberal or more egalitarian regimes remain possible alongside particular, perhaps radically re-envisioned, versions of clean fossil. Ambivalence towards clean fossil technical fix promises is intelligible, given the inherent instability of their co-evolution with neoliberalism and future political regimes.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"The ambition of energy policy has long been to reduce carbon emissions, secure energy supply and provide affordable energy services. In recent years an increasing number of policy instruments have been introduced to promote energy efficiency in different sectors across the EU. While previous research has largely analysed the effectiveness of individual policy instruments and their impact on the diffusion of particular energy efficient technologies or practices, our analysis takes a broader view and examines the mix of existing policies aimed at stimulating reductions in energy use. The empirical focus of the paper is on policy goals and instruments aimed at stimulating energy efficiency in buildings in Finland and the United Kingdom (UK). We trace the development of the policy mixes during 2000–2014 and analyse their emerging overall characteristics. The analysis is based on a mapping of policy goals and instruments, documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. We find that both countries have increasingly complex policy mixes, encompassing a variety of goals and instruments and make use of a range of different instrument types to encourage users to reduce their energy consumption. Despite the shared EU influence, the way in which the policy mixes have evolved in both countries were found to be quite different.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"In the run-up to the 2015 Paris climate talks, the Indian government announced ambitious climate mitigation goals as part of its INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions). Whether India can meet these targets is a critical question with implications for the success of the Paris climate agreement.We assess India’s potential for emissions mitigation through a sectoral lens, focusing on eight dominant sectors – namely electricity production, agriculture, road transport, buildings, and four disaggregated industry subsectors (steel, cement, petrochemicals, and fertilizers).We argue that whether emissions mitigation is favorable from a structural perspective is a function of two main factors: (1) political/organizational feasibility and (2) techno-economic feasibility. Political/organizational feasibility in turn is assessed through two additional factors, market concentration and government concentration. Our central intuition is that fragmented markets and/or fragmented government structures pose barriers for collective action.Road transport represents the most favorable sector for emissions mitigation followed by petrochemicals. Cement and fertilizers are already at or near the global efficiency frontier. Three sectors – electricity, agriculture, and steel – represent hard cases on both dimensions of feasibility. Buildings possess strong techno-economic feasibility but challenging political/organizational feasibility.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"The Tea Party political movement began in the United States in 2009, driven by opposition to the presidency of Barack Obama. Prior research has shown that Tea Party Republicans differ from mainstream Republicans on a range of attitudes, such as belief in climate change and attitudes towards immigrants. However, it is unknown if Tea Party affiliation is consequential for energy policy. In this paper, we use an array of dependent variables related to a number of different energy policy options and find substantial differences between Tea Party Republicans and mainstream Republicans. In particular, Tea Party Republicans are much more supportive of increasing energy supply via fossil fuel extraction and less supportive of regulating power plants than mainstream Republicans. We also find that political affiliation is moderated by education, in which more educated Tea Party supporters are more resistant to energy regulation and more supportive of fossil fuels than Tea Party supporters with less education. Implications for future research and the energy policy regime in the United States are discussed.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"With a long history of oil and gas production and potentially significant reserves of unconventional gas, Scotland represents a notable case amid the growing international controversy over unconventional gas development (UGD). This article applies argumentative discourse analysis to the Scottish debate over UGD and identifies several important storylines which have mobilised different discourse coalitions and shaped public opinion as well as policy-making. For now, anti-UGD storylines appear more encompassing and have achieved greater resonance. Of particular interest, however, is the role of the Scottish government as a third discourse coalition. Through a moratorium on all forms of UGD and a cautious ‘evidence-based approach', the government has established a form of discursive dominance and has successfully minimised electoral risks. But its anti-Westminster storyline – created in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014 – has undermined the government's pragmatic strategy by invoking Scottish resistance to the UK’s pursuit of shale gas. While the evidence-based approach persists as the preeminent storyline, its interpretation has ‘drifted’ from (1) a modestly reformed planning policy to (2) an exercise in scientific fact-finding combined with a public consultation and, arguably, (3) to a precautionary approach that might lay the foundation for an extended moratorium.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"Marine Renewable Energy (MREs) holds extensive environmental, social, and economic potential for rural coastal areas across the globe, which are often resource-rich but capital-poor, often due to historic paradigm of economic (under) development. Focusing on the Highland and Islands region (HIR) of Scotland, we identify a conundrum which is currently limiting overall development of MREs and their positive effects, mainly due to the lack of access to sustained sectorial investments and a stable demand for electricity. From a historic perspective, we identify in the Megaloplis paradigm the reasons for this conundrum. Further, we develop a new policy and governance paradigm, DICEP, rooted in the concepts of diffusion of benefits, inclusive governance, community engagement, regional entrepreneurship, and a balancing top-down approaches with bottom up initiatives. The paradigm builds upon local strengths and policies for combining MREs and economic development policies for expanding non-residential electricity demand through the support of productive activities. Finally, we present two case studies where elements of Megalopolis and DICEP emerge, as well as propose potential localized uses of energy for manufacturing and agricultural practices. DICEP acts as an operationalization of the New Rural Paradigm, and a bridge between the initial diffusion of MREs and their future full deployment.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"In their efforts to improve social housing neighbourhoods, Dutch housing associations attempt to encourage tenants to take a more active role. Generally speaking, bottom-up initiatives and participatory approaches have become popular among Dutch policy-makers as ways to achieve sustainable energy goals. While the rise of local energy cooperatives seems to support this view, we also see that particularly in deprived neighbourhoods, there is no bottom-up activity, nor will it occur without external support. This paper thus examines a case of an externally initiated programme in a Dutch social housing neighbourhood, aiming to place tenants’ needs at the centre. Applying an environmental justice framework, we address both the historical-institutional legacies and the tenants’ positions, showing how institutional pressures built up over time have resulted in a diluting of the programme into a top-down technology-pushed approach. The relevance goes beyond this case: without ensuring the quality of the participation, institutional lock-ins can produce perverse outcomes, with the programme failing to achieve its (energy-efficiency) goals while the intended beneficiaries lose out. As a counterweight, an active process of capacity building is proposed, using an environmental justice approach to examine the conditions for local self-governance and how to address these in a participatory intervention.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"Amidst growing analytical interest in the spatial dimensions of sustainable energy transitions, relatively little attention has been given to the role of sub-national government, or the ways in which dominant socio-technical regimes for energy navigate diverse contexts. This paper addresses these two concerns by assessing the impacts of devolution within the UK on renewable energy development. It draws principally on policy networks analysis as the basis of a comparative assessment, examining how far the governments of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have translated their formal powers in the energy sphere into renewable energy outcomes. Scotland’s relative success in facilitating rapid expansion of on-shore wind is attributed to a more enduring and cohesive policy community around renewable energy growth than in Northern Ireland and Wales, but this success has been adversely affected by fragmenting policy networks around renewables at national (UK) level. The analysis highlights especially the role of planning and consenting, as mechanisms by which devolved governments have worked to contain the potentially disruptive effects of opposition to major infrastructure investments, thereby enhancing regime reproduction.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"Innovation in energy technology is framed as having the potential to advance renewable energy technologies (RET) towards an environmentally and technologically sustainable energy system. Innovation, however, involves more than RET. New energy technologies include fossil fuels which contribute to a country’s ‘innovativeness.’ The ability of states to foster innovation rests on their regulatory capacity, social acceptability and underlying ecological perspective. In this article a theory of state innovation builds upon National Innovation Capacity (NIC), bringing together state regulatory capacity and the eco-sophistication of society to determine acceptable energy technologies. To frame this investigation, a case study is developed about Poland’s attempt to foster a shale gas industry. Poland is chosen as a case study due to its low ranking for innovation, weak RET deployment plans, and use of coal as a primary energy source; it is a ‘low achiever’ on a comparative basis of states with limited innovation capacity. Poland provides two lessons in relation to state innovation: a) Institutional and regulatory action is underpinned by ecological choices made by society influencing institutional and technology preferences; and b) technology cannot simply be bought and imported, but instead needs to be integrated into an existing NIC and a conducive regulatory system.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"This article explores whether old, incumbent industries can prevent new, green industries from emerging by studying the rise and fall of the Norwegian advanced biofuel sector. It investigates three competing explanations that have been proposed to account for why Norway failed to develop a vibrant industry within this field: (i) the petroleum industry acquired all available risk capital, (ii) the petroleum industry captured all relevant technological expertise and (iii) the government failed to provide adequate incentives and support measures. The article applies a qualitative event-history analysis to chart the development of the most important Norwegian advanced biofuel companies – Borregaard (bioethanol), Cambi (biogas), Weyland (bioethanol) and Xynergo (biodiesel) – and uses their success and eventual failure as a key indicator of the condition of the emerging technological innovation system within this field. The article finds that the advanced biofuel companies were hampered mostly by inconsistent and unpredictable government incentives, and concludes that the third explanation best accounts for Norway’s limited success in advanced biofuels.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"Low carbon housing policies embody visions of the future that shape and constrain current choices between different technological pathways. These socio-technical imaginaries include expectations around new ways of living and interacting with technology, with implications for everyday lives. This paper investigates existing expert visions of low carbon housing, and explores these futures with members of the public; utilising empirical data from policy documents, expert interviews and public focus groups. Two competing expert visions of low carbon housing were identified: Passivhaus and Smart Homes. Whilst portrayed as divergent futures, both visions aimed to ‘design out’ the role of occupants, achieving emissions reductions through changes to the built environment and maintaining current lifestyles; a position that was reinforced by an imagined public that was unable or unwilling to accept the need for lifestyle change. This construction of the public did not consider the complex personal and cultural dimensions that influenced public acceptability of future housing: specifically surrounding themes of comfort, control and security that arose within the focus groups. The tensions arising between expert and public imaginaries highlight the difficulties that may surround any transition towards a low carbon future and demonstrate the need to work with, rather than around, the public.",Volume 23,January 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/23/suppl/C,27
"The relatively rare and protracted nature of energy transitions implies that it is vital to look at historical experiences for lessons about how they might unfold in the future. The fastest historical sector-specific energy transitions observed here was thirty years. However, full energy transitions, involving all sectors and services, have taken much longer. Ultimately, the price of energy services played a crucial role in creating the incentives to stimulate energy transitions, but energy price shocks may have acted as a catalyst for stimulating processes that led to certain energy transitions. An additional key factor is whether the new technology offers new characteristics of value to the consumer, which can help create a market even when the initial price is higher. A crucial factor that can delay a transition is the reaction of the incumbent and declining industries. Nevertheless, governments have, in a few instances, created the institutional setting to stimulate energy transitions to low-polluting energy sources, and this could be done again, if the political will and alternative energy sources were available. Finally, past energy transitions have had major impacts on the incumbent industries which have declined, on economic transformations and on inequality.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"The recent debate on the temporal dynamics of energy transitions is crucial since one of the main reasons for embarking on transitions away from fossil fuels is tackling climate change. Long-drawn out transitions, taking decades or even centuries as we have seen historically, are unlikely to help achieve climate change mitigation targets. Therefore, the pace of energy transitions and whether they can be sped up is a key academic and policy question. Our argument is that while history is important in order to understand the dynamics of transitions, the pace of historic transitions is only partly a good guide to the future. We agree with Sovacool’s [1] argument that quicker transitions have happened in the past and may therefore also be possible in the future globally. The key reason for our optimism is that historic energy transitions have not been consciously governed, whereas today a wide variety of actors is engaged in active attempts to govern the transition towards low carbon energy systems. In addition, international innovation dynamics can work in favour of speeding up the global low-carbon transition. Finally, the 2015 Paris agreement demonstrates a global commitment to move towards a low carbon economy for the first time, thereby signalling the required political will to foster quick transitions and to overcome resistance, such as from incumbents with sunk infrastructure investments.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28

Historical evidence of “grand” or global energy system transitions taking decades to centuries to unfold contrasted with highly selective recent and rapid examples of mostly incremental technological change make for an engaging argument.

"A survey of key processes at work in the energy space suggests that a rapid transition away from fossil fuels is possible, and for several reasons. The energy policy environment is increasingly supportive of innovation and rapid system change. Zero carbon replacement technologies are available now. Transition outcomes are firmly established and affordable. The energy space is resourceful and flexible enough to accommodate novel solutions. However, to fully mobilize and accelerate these processes, a universal acknowledgment of the climate crisis will be required. When acknowledgement occurs, the world must be ready for action. It will need a framework for rapid energy transition.Any such framework will focus on the main instigators of climate change: the billion or so mechanical devices (gasoline engines, industrial boilers, etc.) worldwide that burn fossil fuels. Those devices are to be replaced or modified. An effective framework would organize this task along four energy sector pathways: electricity generation, transportation, heavy industry, and buildings. The framework would maintain system functionality as transition occurs. With such a framework in hand, the global community will be prepared to face the climate emergency head on, and respond with certainty and speed.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28

"For over forty years energy expectations have been riddled with internal contradictions, and all too often a failure to recognise complexity, the nature and scale of the challenges to be faced, and resultant uncertainty. Key elements of Shell’s “World of Internal Contradictions” scenario, issued internally in October 1974, still hold good. Some other elements have since intruded, though they should not have been entirely unsuspected. The paper opens with a summary of the October 1974, risks then anticipated: another regional conflict in the Middle East; further serious threats to energy supplies; and another currency crisis and recession. Changes in social attitudes were thought likely to shift the emphasis from working for high achievement to ‘takers and dreamers’ having a more influential role. There were numerous internal contradictions anticipated in the evolution of this long-term scenario that have been apparent over the past forty years and seem likely to continue. Some fundamentals of the exploitation and use of energy resources were as apparent then as they are now. The future, like the past, seems likely to be riddled with internal contradictions and failure to find satisfactory resolution of important challenges for the human race.

"The version of practice theory developed by Theodore Schatzki is employed increasingly in energy consumption research. This emerged in response to problems Wittgenstein had identified in the core logic of prevailing rule-based, inter-subjectivist social theories of the late 20th century. Since then, however, the use and development of Schatzkian practice theory in energy studies has not been subjected to ongoing, robust philosophical critique. This paper offers some thoughts on how such a critique might proceed. It begins by outlining the roots of Schatzki’s version of practice theory in his critique of Giddens and Bourdieu. It then explores three areas where practice theory appears to need more in-depth critique and development: a fuller account of the ontological status of ‘practices’ and what this implies for research models; more clarity on lines of causality; and the place of socio-economic issues within practices and their descriptions. It concludes that practice theory provides a very insightful framework for heuristic models in energy research but that its usefulness is held back by these yet unresolved difficulties.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28

However, the effectiveness of such behavior change interventions is often limited, or even unknown, due to weaknesses in program design and evaluation of program impact on behavior. To help policymakers avoid such pitfalls, this paper outlines some practical guidelines for designing, conducting and, most importantly, evaluating the impact of energy-related behavior change programs and initiatives. We explain why randomized controlled trials are generally the optimal approach for obtaining scientifically valid estimates of a behavioral program’s efficacy and effectiveness. In parallel, we offer specific guidelines for strengthening the validity, reliability and generalizability of empirical findings about program impact on behavior. Adopting these guidelines will help to improve program design and delivery, thereby allowing more accurate evaluation of the true cost-effectiveness, utility and mass-scalability of future energy-related behavioral interventions.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"Although in academic literature several analyses can be found concerning energy policy instruments and their effectiveness in supporting renewables, usually no distinction is made between different investor groups that these instruments address. The present article focuses on an emerging group of investors, namely renewable energy communities, and on policy instruments fostering their operation and spread. The aim of the article is to assess and compare national support systems in Germany and in the Netherlands, respectively to identify which instruments are perceived as the ones most effectively supporting community-based renewable energy projects. To do so, first we adopt an investors’ risk framework to evaluate the effectiveness of support systems according to their ability to decrease investors’ risks, and we operationalize this framework by introducing indicators for a theory led analysis. Second, we also explore the investors’ perceptions of the policy instruments by conducting interviews with community members to see which instruments are perceived supportive in practice and which ones are less popular among community investors. Our results show that in both countries instruments designed and expected to reduce specific types of risk do not always achieve that goal practice, and this is reflected in the perception of the aforementioned investor groups.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"Energy supply and use play vital roles in transition towards a sustainable society. Nuclear energy is used or planned to be used in 40 countries globally, yet the contribution of nuclear energy to sustainable development remains an area of contention. The purpose of this exploratory study is to understand the framing of sustainability within national energy strategies of countries pursuing or planning to start nuclear energy production. The strategies were analyzed by assessing the occurrence of 56 facets of sustainability grouped into 7 dimensions. In addition, the definitions of sustainability used in the strategies and the information on consultation and public participation in their preparation was reviewed. Most strategies mentioned sustainability but did not provide its explicit definition. Risk, waste management and social aspects of sustainability were mentioned relatively less frequently than to environmental, governance and economic aspects of sustainability. The information on consultation and public participation portrayed a limited extent of such processes.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"Environmental problems can be reduced if people would participate in smart energy systems. Little is known about which factors motivate people to actually participate in smart energy systems. We tested the factors that influence individuals’ interest and actual participation in smart energy systems. We compared the predictive power of the value-belief-norm theory with a novel model to explain pro-environmental actions: the value-identity-personal norm model. Both focus on normative considerations in explaining behaviour, but the VIP model focuses on general rather than behaviour-specific antecedents. Our results show that both models explained a similar amount of variance in interest and actual participation in smart energy systems. This suggests that the value-identity-personal norm model is a promising model to explain and promote pro-environmental actions such as participation in smart grids. Further, it is more parsimonious than the value-belief-norm theory and focuses on general factors that are likely to predict other environmental behaviours as well. The value-identity-personal norm model is therefore a particularly promising model in promoting a range of environmental behaviours.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"Energy renovations are considered to have great potential for reducing the problem of excessive energy consumption. Thus far, initiatives to increase the number of energy renovations have mostly consisted of financial incentives and technical home solutions. Such initiatives overlook the fact that the way people live their everyday lives plays a crucial role in understanding why they choose whether to perform an energy renovation. This study is based on an anthropological investigation of ten Danish families and their decision-making process while receiving free energy advice, which, in many cases, ended as an energy renovation project in the home. During the study, gender emerged as a significant factor in two ways. First, energy renovations were perceived differently by men and women as a consequence of their different everyday practices. Second, there was a cultural norm about the division between what men and women do in the home. This cultural norm placed energy renovation in the male sphere of interest. These findings call for new methods to increase the number of energy renovations that focus on the home, not only as a technical issue that can be improved but also as a living space that contains different gender practices and cultural influences.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"The phrase ‘small is beautiful’ holds true for the micro-hydro plants discussed in this article. Micro-hydro plants can convert the energy of falling water into electricity. In India, access to electricity cannot be taken for granted, especially in rural areas, which do not yet have grid extension or where it is too costly or infeasible. In these cases, micro-hydro plants are a welcome solution. Here I discuss the efforts of two non-governmental organizations, a private company, and a government agency, to facilitate micro-hydro projects in India, thereby increasing the socio-economic empowerment of rural inhabitants without electricity access. Based on extensive ethnographic data and constructivist conceptualizations of scale and consequences I find that these projects can indeed be described as “beautiful” technology interventions. In line with the common discourse on “small is beautiful,” the projects emphasize community engagement, control, and locality. Yet, importantly, they are “beautiful” in diverse ways. The actors set different priorities when implementing their small-scale technology interventions. Highlighting these priorities is important because they can empower people to acquire different roles, ranging from engaged consumers to prosumers. Instead of solely concentrating on the (small) scale of a technology I plead to consider the significance of implementing these interventions.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"Energy transition in Germany requires deployment of new electricity transmission infrastructure, such as new electricity grids, which faces opposition of communities, where infrastructure is planned. Scientific evidence on differences in socal and public acceptance is limited and in combination to a particular type of infrastructure, such as electricity transmission networks, is almost non-existant. Also there is an additional need to understand how acceptance, which is more a passive attitute towards something imposed top-down, can be changed to willingness of participation. Based on several methods of stakeholders dialogue such as survey, feedback forms and observation on the site of public information events, this paper addresses social and public acceptance issues in two electricity transmission pilot projects. In doing so, it advances, tests, and refines core tenets from two major streams of thought related to NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) and decide, announce-defend (DAD) concepts. The study analyzes these themes through a comparison of the Sued.Link connection being realized by the Transmission System Operator TenneT and the Bertikow-Pasewalk connection being realized by the 50Hertz. The results allow us to identify major concerns regarding these two pilot projects as well as to provide recommendations on successfulness of the actions to address these concerns.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"Contemporary environmental campaigns often communicate the benefits of acting environmentally-friendly, assuming that larger benefits will translate into stronger intentions to act environmentally-friendly – a mechanism known as “valuation by calculation”. As such, these campaigns have neglected the possibility that decisions to act environmentally-friendly can also be preceded by “valuation by feeling”, where anticipated positive feelings drive people’s intention to act environmentally-friendly.Acting environmentally-friendly can be driven by anticipated positive feelings because it can be intrinsically rewarding to contribute to the good cause. Indeed, across two studies we found that the stronger people anticipated to feel good about acting environmentally-friendly, the stronger their intention was to act environmentally-friendly. Importantly, anticipated positive feelings were a much stronger predictor of people’s intention to act environmentally-friendly compared to the perceived quantity of the benefits of pro-environmental actions. This indicates that environmental campaigns that resonate with people’ feelings, instead of exclusively appealing to their calculations, may be an important unexploited route to encourage pro-environmental behavior.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"The uneven temporal distribution of domestic energy demand is a well-known phenomenon that is increasingly troublesome for energy infrastructures and sustainable or low carbon energy systems. People tend to demand energy, and especially electricity, at specific times of the day and they do not necessarily do so when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. The potential value of demand response as a solution rests on understanding the nature of temporal energy demand and the timing of the interconnected domestic activities that drive it. The paper uses current and historical time-use diary data to explore the temporal change in laundry practices in the United Kingdom over the last 20 years. ‘Doing the laundry’ is frequently cited as a potentially ‘flexible demand’ and yet very little is known about when people do the laundry, who does it at particular times, how this has changed and what implications this might have for the flexibility of demand. Through this analysis of laundry, the paper starts to unpack some of the ‘doings’ that contribute to current known energy demand and considers the extent to which they may or may not enable flexibility in the context of consumer demand response.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"We study how carbon emissions from U.S. housing stock change with urban location and associated population density, using data from the U.S. Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) and American Community Survey (ACS) in a mediation model to quantify direct and indirect effects of population density on carbon emissions. Urban living in the United States today is generally associated with lower levels of residential carbon emissions, with some of the more significant effects being indirect. For example, more densely populated areas are associated with decreased housing size, which in turn decreases carbon emissions. One of the largest indirect effects observed is from the prevalence of natural gas heating in urban areas. We also observe large indirect effects from the urban prevalence of attached and multi-family housing. A policy question is whether emissions-reducing housing choices could be effectively promoted in non-urban areas.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"Rebound effect studies are useful for policy making, as they indicate the extent to which increases in energy efficiency lead to lower energy savings than those predicted by engineering calculations. Existing rebound studies assume energy consumption changes arise from an economically rational response, by consumers, to cheaper energy services. This misses the possibility that energy efficiency increases could have effects on wider society, organization and material-human relationships which lead to increases in energy consumption for reasons other than economic utility. This paper argues that setting rebound studies within a properly worked out social theory would give a fuller picture of these causal routes. Noting that ‘practice theories’ drawn from Schatzki are being used increasingly in energy consumption studies, the paper critically expounds Schatzki’s development of practice theory and human-material ‘arrangements’, offering this as a framework for rebound studies. It then uses a small case study, of growth in computer use in a university research cluster, to compare rebound effect results obtained by the traditional approach and the Schatzkian approach. The latter gives rebounds up to 100% higher than the former. The paper recommends that policy take these wider causal determinants into account when estimating likely effects of energy efficiency increases.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"To achieve energy savings, emerging energy management technologies and programs require customer adoption. Although a variety of models can be used to explain the adoption of energy management technologies and programs, they overlook the seemingly unconventional element of level of affiliation with nature. In fact, connectedness to nature has been identified as an important driver of many pro-environmental behaviors, but its role in pro-environmental technology adoption is also not well understood. Can affiliation with nature help to bridge the apparent gap—and complex chain of events—between sustainable technology adoption and protecting natural resources? Based on survey data from 856 southern California residents, this study investigated the influence of connectedness to nature and other factors on intentions to adopt five energy management technologies and programs: using three platforms to monitor home energy use (website, mobile phone application, in-home display); signing up for a time-of-use pricing plan; and participating in demand response events. Regression results showed that nature connectedness was the strongest predictor of all outcomes such that higher nature connectedness predicted greater likelihood of technology and program adoption. These findings suggest that connectedness to nature may facilitate “bridging the logic gap” between sustainable innovation adoption and environmental protection.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"District heating in Sweden has undergone changes in recent decades. Parallel with transition towards sustainability, a considerable ownership restructuring has occurred, due to liberalization of energy markets. The aim of this paper is to describe and analyze trends of mergers and acquisitions in the Swedish district heating market. A systematic review of ownership in 290 municipalities has been performed through annual reports, press releases, websites, municipal minutes, newspaper articles and personal contacts. The paper shows a transformation from municipal to diverse ownership, decreased municipal ownership and increased internationalization. The window of opportunity provided by liberalization was used especially by the “big three” (E.ON, Fortum and Vattenfall) in order to strengthen market position early in the wave of acquisitions. The time period 1996–2005 was especially hectic, showing strategies of cherry picking hot spots for acquisitions, with the “big three” being responsible for a large proportion of these. The period after 2006 showed trends of companies selling several district heating businesses at once, through large-scale disinvestment. The paper shows a transformation of the district heating regime, first as a reaction to changes on the electricity market and later in its own right, raising concerns regarding the weak position of customers.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"Building electricity grids out to sea implies a radical transformation of grid topologies. In time, a marine super-grid is conceivable. If growing numbers of subsea electricity cables are meshed with marine renewable, a ‘greening’ of such grids is also possible. Based on interview research, this paper examines one such ambitious proposal: the Northern Seas Countries Offshore Grid Initiative (NSCOGI). The Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) on technology transitions is used to evaluate progress to date. Obstacles uncovered include competing and still immature grid technology niches. There is only equivocal support from key actors within the relevant socio-technical electricity regime. National grid Transmission System Operators (TSOs) appear more interested in subsea cables to trade electricity rather than enhancing marine renewables. While the EU might be assumed to be a vital actor to support a North Sea Grid, it has only limited influence. National policy insiders and decisions matter more. This paper stresses the residual importance of the national level for offshore wind and electricity grids. A marine super-grid wired up with offshore wind-farms throughout the North Sea, is both more tentative in its emergence, but also ambiguous in its support for offshore wind.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"This paper draws lessons from long run trends in energy markets for energy and climate policy. An important lesson is that consumer responses to energy markets change with economic development. The British experience suggests that income elasticities1 of demand for energy services have tended to follow an inverse-U shape curve. Thus, at low levels of economic development, energy service consumption tends to be quite responsive to per capita income changes; at mid-levels, consumption tends to be very responsive to changes in income per capita; and, at high levels, consumption is less responsive to income changes. The paper also highlights the importance of formulating integrated energy service policies to reduce risks to developing countries of locking-in to carbon intensive infrastructure or behaviour. Without guidance and incentives, rapid economic development is likely to lock consumers into high energy service prices in the long run and bind the economy onto a high energy intensity trajectory with major long run economic and environmental impacts. Thus, effective energy service policies in periods of rapid development, such as in China and India at present, are crucial for the long run prosperity of the economy and their future ability to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions.",Volume 22,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/22/suppl/C,28
"This paper offers the identification of the hydropower energy systems events that have led to eco-distributive conflicts in the Colombian case and other countries of the region supported by the socio-energy systems framework and political ecology concepts.The analysis of secondary information about the building and installation of thirteen hydroelectric plants between 1980 and 2010 in Colombia led to the identification of three consecutive time periods in which the conflicts generated by the installation of the mentioned plants exhibited distinctive characteristics.The social and political effects of chosen energy systems on individuals, organizations and communities can be diverse and vast, but are usually neglected by decision makers and national policy designers to focus instead on economical and technological aspects. The lessons from past Colombian energy transitions could be integrated not only into the current national policy debates, but also into those of other countries in the region undergoing similar transitions.

By drawing on empirical observations in the aftermath of Nepal’s humanitarian crises in 2015, we showcase the vulnerability of vital energy systems that threatens human security and negatively impacts on the lives and livelihoods of those affected. In search of greater human security, we observed a reverse energy transition whereby people abandoned modern fuels and returned to biomass-based traditional cooking practices. These observations in Nepal suggest that people respond and adapt to energy insecurity with strategies that move them in and out of energy impoverishment in a much more fluid process than many of the contemporary statistics and known indicators imply.

About 2.5 years after its launch the programme was effectively terminated and is now seen as a dramatic policy failure. In this paper we analyse the reasons for the failure and the politics that led to the rise and the fall of the Green Deal.

The article presents key theoretical concepts from the discipline of policy studies and shows how they can be of use in multidisciplinary energy research. This is illustrated by presenting the results of a systematic review of academic literature on the use of policy studies concepts in academic literature on energy policy in The Netherlands. Results reveal the main theoretical concepts that were used as well as the identification of major research clusters.

"Technological advances allow electricity consumers to become ‘prosumers’, offering services to the grid, such as generation, demand reduction, load shifting and electricity storage. Well-integrated prosumers improve the resilience and efficiency of the energy system and facilitate the integration of renewable energy, improving energy and climate security. These technologies, however, change how energy services are experienced. Understanding public perceptions is necessary prior to widespread introduction.A 2015 survey (n = 509) investigated perceptions of demand reduction, load shifting and energy storage technologies as prosumer activities in Israel. Israelis showed little interest in remote controlled household appliances to facilitate load shifting, preferring to respond personally via smart controls to information communicated by the grid. There was similar low interest in permitting grid access to electricity stored in personal electric vehicle batteries. Financial incentives increased acceptance in both cases to a third of respondents.The survey identified various barriers to acceptance: health and privacy concerns about smart meters; low trust in the institutions overseeing these technologies; perceived low public support to reduce electricity demand; how incentives were framed and no perceived relationship with meeting national energy priorities such as affordability and energy independence.

"The transition to a sustainable energy regime is not just an engineering question, but a social and cultural issue as well. In this paper, we consider one contested technology still in development, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), from a socio-cultural perspective. CCS is widely deemed to be a necessary bridging technology to a low-carbon economy, but the technology needs to pass considerable hurdles before widespread use. The importance of cultural issues in CCS deployment has been acknowledged, but research on the large-scale cultural patterns is lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we combine aggregated individual level measurements of technology opinions with indicators that characterize national cultures. We use survey data from a Eurobarometer together with prior cross-cultural data to show that nation-specific cultural issues can be used as a macro-level approximation of public reactions to CCS technology. Public reactions incorporate cultural factors such as the degree of separation between groups, strength of institutions over space, time and social roles, and society’s tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity. On the basis of the analysis, we provide a richer frame for analysts wishing to understand why and how societies and societal actors challenge and contest technologies and energy regimes.",Volume 21,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/21/suppl/C,29
"Renewable energy is often framed by policymakers and the media as an environmental or ‘green’ issue motivated by global climate change and the need for greenhouse gas reductions. However, some researchers studying social responses to renewables have found that factors other than opinions about climate change may be more influential in determining support for renewables. This study analyzes survey data from a study of five communities in the Rocky Mountain region of the U.S. experiencing wind energy development to examine the relationship between environmental beliefs, climate change opinions, and support for renewable energy. Results show that views on renewable energy comprise a distinct dimension of public views on energy, environment, and climate, suggesting that public support for renewable energy is less related to environmental beliefs than to some other factors, including beliefs about economic benefits and concerns about landscape impacts. Findings also indicate that the frequency with which individuals see nearby wind turbines are strongly related to their level of support for renewable energy, while physical proximity is not. Overall, results suggest that ceasing to frame renewable energy as an environmental issue and instead framing it in a way that invokes locally relevant social values may garner broader public support.",Volume 21,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/21/suppl/C,29
"Feedback systems on energy consumption are being provided more and more worldwide. However, the success of these systems in terms of increasing energy efficiency in households is still limited. We assume that this circumstance is due to the fact that present energy feedback systems primarily address individuals’ financial goals, thereby neglecting the fact that people may carry a set of multiple goals towards usage. In three preliminary studies and one main study, we examined the underlying goals which motivate people to use web-based feedback on their own electricity consumption. We identified and replicated four distinct goals towards feedback usage: having fun, learning how to save electricity, controlling and reducing costs, and avoiding inconvenience due to perceived negative impacts of feedback usage. In the Main Study, we investigated a sample from a smart meter field trial (N = 345) and applied a model-based cluster analysis to identify distinguishable goal profiles based on the four goal factors. We analysed the predictive power of the identified multiple goal profiles on participants’ actual usage of feedback for a time span of six months.

"To meet targets on fuel poverty, energy efficiency and carbon emissions existing homes need to be more energy efficient. We report the results of a participatory action research project to explore the challenges associated with energy efficiency retrofit programmes and ways to better implement future schemes.Six focus groups were held with 48 participants from a range of energy efficiency roles. Data were analysed thematically using the research question “What are the challenges presented by implementing energy efficiency retrofit programmes”.We identified four themes in the data: Funding mechanisms; Predicting performance; Installation; and People. Challenges include funding mechanisms for retrofit programmes resulting in insufficient time to plan, publicise, implement and evaluate a scheme and insufficient flexibility to specify the most appropriate intervention for individual homes. Site workers sometimes need to adapt retrofit designs because of insufficient detail from the designer and can equate quality of installation with quality of finish. Landlords and occupier behaviour can impact on the programme’s success and there is a need for greater information on benefits for landlords and for energy behaviour change interventions run alongside retrofit programmes for occupiers.

"A substantial amount of the over 1.5 million photovoltaic (PV) systems in Germany are installed in residential households. Among these households, those with the option of self-consumption, i.e., to consume self-generated electricity can reduce their electricity consumption, especially grid electricity, by load shifting and acting in an energy-efficient manner. We examined how electricity consumption is influenced by contextual and attitudinal factors. We administered an online questionnaire to 425 households with PV recruited from 15 PV-related web portals. The results showed that their electricity consumption was not lower than in other households, but environmental motivation was higher. Sufficiency attitudes and environmental motivation were predictors of engaging in energy-saving behaviors which in turn contributed to consumption reduction. Battery storage and automatic load shifting increased self-consumption. Evidence was found for a distinction between households with PV installation before and after grid parity was achieved, especially concerning moderation effects of the economic framework. To reduce electricity consumption, a combination of efficient technologies and more environmentally motivated energy-saving behaviors should be supported.",Volume 21,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/21/suppl/C,29

Therefore this paper explores the meaning of energy security for key experts in the UK energy sector, with a particular focus on the security of electricity systems in the context of a low-carbon transition. A set of 22 energy security issues is discussed with 25 experts from across the energy sector in the UK, in order to get a grasp on which aspects of energy security are felt to be most important, and to discover the underlying concepts which are used by experts when making or justifying these choices. The results from the interviews show that there is a real need to attempt to take into account multiple competing and context-specific views on energy security, instead of trying to close the discussion down around a small number of simple quantifiable indicators or metrics. The results also show that there is no clearly discernible alignment between experts’ perspectives and the type of organisation for which they work.",Volume 21,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/21/suppl/C,29
"Ghana has been seen as a potential market for small nuclear reactors and Ghanaian nuclear officials have, on occasion, expressed an interest in such reactors. However, Ghana seems to be heading towards procuring a reactor from Russia with a capacity of 1000–1200 MW. A power plant with such a large power generation capacity is not appropriate to Ghana’s limited electricity grid or its financial circumstances. This paper examines the likely reasons for this focus and argues that despite greater government interest in setting up nuclear reactors, Ghana’s nuclear establishment may not have the political clout to force through the purchase of a reactor, and has therefore attempted to position itself as a complete, one-stop solution to Ghana’s electricity crisis, by calling for the construction of just one or two large nuclear power plants. The paper draws on the role of discursive elements in energy policy making, discusses the policy implications of this reactor choice, and offers evidence for the proposition that decision about nuclear power are not made on the basis of merely techno-economic considerations but are driven by a range of social and political factors.",Volume 21,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/21/suppl/C,29
"Over the last three decades, climate change has become publicly defined as an important social problem deserving action. A substantial body of social science research examines the patterns of climate change views in the general publics of countries around the world. In this review essay, we identify the strongest and most consistent predictors of key dimensions of climate change views within many countries, and we also discuss the prevailing theoretical explanations of these specific effects. Since the US has yet to adopt comprehensive climate change mitigation policy and has historically played an obstructionist role in international climate negotiations, we further explain the political dynamics of US climate change views that help characterize the US’s outlier status among industrial capitalist democracies. We then present an integrative theoretical framework—based upon an extension of the anti-reflexivity thesis—that explains why the strength and consistency of predictors relate to how closely those predictors distinguish ideological and material positions defending the industrial capitalist system from those positions accepting that it should be reformed or restructured. We end with a brief discussion of promising avenues through which future research may address key gaps in our understanding of climate change views.",Volume 21,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/21/suppl/C,29
"Despite unsupportive political conditions for renewable energy (RE) in Australia, a new movement is emerging. About 70 Australian community groups have started to embrace the concept of community renewable energy (CRE) and develop their own projects. However, faced with a complex institutional environment and the absence of national government support, only a few groups have established operating CRE projects as yet. In this situation the role of local government (LG) ‘closest to the people’ deserves more attention. By presenting empirical evidence from an Australia-wide survey and a number of semi-structured interviews, we identify motivations, barriers and opportunities of LGs in RE deployment, giving special attention to the role LGs in enabling CRE initiatives. Our survey finds that RE generation by LGs has become a widespread budget relevant activity. The majority of LGs have yet to recognise the social benefits associated with a community collaboration in the field of RE. However perceived financial and regulatory barriers limit the scope of action for LGs and their communities, and higher-level government support is essential.

Using nine Southeast Asian countries as case studies and including other relevant players involved in the dependent dynamics, the findings show interdependence in international energy relations and indicate how specific characteristics of the interactions lead to different aspects of dependent relations: external supply dependence, external demand dependence, and economic interdependence. Based on dependence levels measured by the index, symmetric and asymmetric energy dependence of the selected nine cases has been analyzed and compared, in which the results not only delineate variations of dependency status but also reflect different aspects of energy dependence in each energy product. The index has also been applied to describe bilateral energy interactions between selected countries, demonstrating how asymmetric energy dependency relations are formed and why energy import dependence is not always negative.",Volume 21,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/21/suppl/C,29
"Changes in the electricity sector since the turn of the century have brought significant penetration of wind generation resources onto the electric power grid. Creating a low-carbon and sustainable electric systems to respond to climate change and meet societal energy needs requires different technologies and changes in supporting policies and institutions. But just how these institutions are creating and implementing new policies has emerged as an important area of inquiry. Changing how the electricity system works requires coordinated interaction across many different stakeholder groups and multiple levels of governance. We explore these emerging processes of policy implementation by examining how wind energy resources are changing the operation of the electric grid. To do this, we develop an in-depth, grounded case study examining decision making within the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, a U.S. Regional Transmission Organization. We use a multi-method approach to the strategic action field theory (SAF; e.g. Moulton and Sandfort, 2015) to examine how MISO created and implemented policy, changing energy markets and power systems operation to allow for the integration of wind resources. Our study examines the critical and understudied role of energy policy implementation in practice and focuses on how stakeholders are making decisions which are shaping the use and value of new and existing energy technologies and, in doing so, transforming the energy system.",Volume 21,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/21/suppl/C,29
"Few technologies in history diffused as intensively and fast as mobile phones, to the point where they have become the most democratic technology. The article analyzes historical patterns of mobile phone growth and their effects in energy needs. Through an empirical analysis employing diffusion models on data for 227 countries between 1980 and 2010, it is concluded that global demand may saturate at around one subscription per person and the diffusion of mobile-broadband connection has contributed to sustain growth. Demand has already showed signs of saturation in developed countries, while there is still potential for growth in developing countries. Impacts on energy consumption are assessed with the help of a field trial. Even though the energy consumed in phone charging was not very significant (6–8 TWh) in 2010, it becomes substantially higher when infrastructural needs are included (93 TWh). The actual trends suggest that mobile communication might have a sizeable direct effect on energy consumption—although the net impact on energy demand is more difficult to estimate. This can become an issue in developing countries, where the adoption of mobile phones is catching-up rapidly with the world average, in a context of generalized increasing electricity demand.",Volume 21,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/21/suppl/C,29
"The sustainability of energy policy performance is determined by a combination of environmental, economic and equity impacts on society. To date, analysis of the equity impacts of energy policy have been largely overlooked in favour of environmental and economic impacts. As equity is an important issue within sustainability and energy justice considerations, this paper sets out to provide a framework and methodology which allows an assessment of both policy effectiveness in terms of an environmental and economic evaluation, followed up by an assessment of resultant quantitative equity impacts on society, in order to engender a holistic policy sustainability evaluation. Following an investigation of prominent energy policy equity issues and Australian peoples preferences towards equity, multiple scenarios are evaluated for effectiveness within the Australian National Electricity Market. The results of this evaluation provide an evidence base for the development of an alternative energy scenario which addresses the identified equity issues whilst meeting policy goals. The equity evaluation demonstrates the comparative equity resultant from each scenario and identifies the apportioning of burden according to income level. The proposed evaluation processes allow the policy maker to develop policies sensitive to both effectiveness and equity, and can be applied in energy justice conscious jurisdictions.",Volume 21,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/21/suppl/C,29
"Brazil has enormous silicon reserves and solar irradiance levels, but the participation of solar energy in its electricity mix was inexpressive until recently. However, the current policies of the Brazilian government have been responsible for an increasing deployment of photovoltaic (PV) systems and thus provided more favorable conditions for the emergence of a national PV industry. This article analyzes the development of the Brazilian PV sector in its “interconnectedness” with the global renewable energy market and therefore is presented as a contribution for the energy studies, as well as an empirical case for the “sociology of globalization”. The Chinese policies for photovoltaic energy are taken as parameter for the discussion of the Brazilian experience in order to highlight the growing importance of renewable energy investments in emerging economies and the decisive role played by the national States in pushing forward the renewable energy industry as a strategic sector for their privileged insertion in the competitive global order.",Volume 21,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/21/suppl/C,29
"While technological innovation is an implicit element of any plausible strategy for responding to climate change, the complexity of innovation processes has not been adequately accounted for in such strategies. Using many examples from different areas of technological innovation, we show that the inevitable unintended and unforeseeable consequences of innovation likely make it impossible to strategically steer the global energy system in desired directions. Given this conclusion, we then look at technological complexity in terms of a simple three-level schema of sociotechnical change. This perspective points towards innovation policies that focus on long-term, incremental advance at the level of individual technologies, and on public policies that use a public goods-public works rationale to justify government investments in the needed innovations.",Volume 21,November 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/21/suppl/C,29
"The activities employed in the development of unconventional hydrocarbon resources have been accompanied with health and environmental damages. To address the risks and damages from these activities, social scientists are probing probabilities of harm, estimating damages, and evaluating the ability of governmental regulators to arrest conduct causing damages. This lead article for a special issue on “Risks, the Social Sciences, and Unconventional Hydrocarbons” summarizes twenty papers to offer insights for developing policies to address future unconventional hydrocarbon development. Although economic, cultural, and political distinctions mean that people in different countries have diverse expectations on how their government should regulate energy development, the experiences reported by the papers of this special issue suggest that appropriate technology and governmental oversight can minimize adverse effects. Future research on the application and incorporation of ideas and knowledge into decisions and activities present challenges that call for innovative social science research to assist policy makers in meeting the challenges presented by the world's need for energy resources.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"Stoutenborough et al. [1] recently published an article in Energy Research and Social Science with data to show that use of the term ‘fracking’ versus ‘hydraulic fracturing’ matters little with regards to the level of concern elicited by this form of energy development. The authors conclude that word choice (or ‘framing’) of this form of unconventional fossil fuel development is ‘much ado about nothing’ and that ‘survey research into fracking need not overly worry about the choice of [word] strategy’ (p. 56). These inferences are problematic. First, despite the authors’ repeated claims that prior research has not explored differences in public attitudes on this issue when ‘fracking’ versus other language is used, prior research has examined this topic – via a very similar methodological approach – and generated opposite findings. One difference is that Stoutenborough et al. used ‘hydraulic fracturing’ as the alternative term, whereas the previous, similar study used ‘shale gas development’. I discuss why the different comparisons likely yielded divergent results. I further argue that the authors’ conclusions are unjustified and ill-advised based on the data from the two surveys in concert. Word choice does matter when discussing this issue; the word ‘fracking’ should be avoided.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"Darrick Evensen has responded to our recently published article, “Is ‘fracking’ a new dirty word? The influence of word choice on public views toward natural gas attitudes.” He has expressed concerns regarding our conclusions and has pointed out some omissions in our literature review. We appreciate the discussion on this topic and for pointing out the additional literature. We have carefully considered Dr. Evensen’s comments and reviewed the recommended articles, and we remain confident in our conclusions. Our results indicate that survey researchers can use the more familiar term “fracking” rather than “hydraulic fracturing” without biasing their results. Our research focused on this particular issue and the associated rhetorical debate. In that regard, we believe our work differs from that referenced by Dr. Evensen, which seems to focus on the terms to correctly describe the technical process of natural gas extraction. And, it is this important difference that likely led to what may appear to be contradictory conclusions.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"We explore the extent to which public perceptions of shale gas development vary across three survey samples—one each at: (1) national (USA), (2) state (NY and PA), and (3) regional levels (ten counties in the Marcellus Shale). We compare results from a survey of Marcellus Shale region residents (n = 1202) to those from a similar survey of a US sample (n = 1625), with an oversampling of residents from NY and PA (n = 516). A key difference between the local sample and the other two samples is that respondents’ beliefs about impacts of development explain much more variance in support for/opposition to development in the local sample. The beliefs about development that associate most closely with support/opposition vary across scale as well. Nevertheless, a few core values are important for predicting support/opposition across all samples. These results suggest a threshold effect in that local perceptions of shale gas development do not seem to extend far beyond the counties immediately affected by development. Construal level theory and social representations theory help explain why perceptions at the local level may differ from the regional and national levels. We consider implications for communication and social science research on energy development broadly.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"In North America, regulations on unconventional oil and gas development are emerging and changing in response to growing public pressure from national environmental organizations and local, grassroots alliances. However, rural residents of many “fracked” regions have been quiet about their experiences with the oil and gas industry. What explains this absence of collective action, and what do discontented people do when their communities lack the conditions for mobilization? In southern Saskatchewan (Canada) and northeastern Pennsylvania (US), rural landowners rarely express opposition through collective actions such as demonstrations, petitions, or civil disobedience. The lack of collective mobilization in each case results from ambivalent perceptions of the oil and gas industry, combined with a paucity of organizational capacity and political opportunities. Yet in interviews, some residents express a wide range of grievances and describe their efforts, as individuals, to resist the negative impacts of the oil and gas industry on their lands and livelihoods. The results of this study suggest that nonmobilized communities should not necessarily be understood as sites of consent. Instead, the effects of powerlessness may propel residents to act on their grievances by individually confronting industry while otherwise remaining quiet.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"This paper explores the extent to which local public support for an unconventional gas development (UGD) project is associated with public revenues disbursed to county and municipal governments where UGD occurs. Pennsylvania adopted “impact fees” in 2012, which have raised more than $400 million for use by county and municipal governments that host UGD. We designed a public opinion survey (N = 453) that oversamples residents in UGD counties in Pennsylvania to test whether residents in counties and municipalities that received impact fees are more supportive of a hypothetical UGD project than residents in counties and municipalities that received less or no impact fee revenue. We found that impact fee revenue is positively associated with support for the UGD project. Further, the level of government receiving the funds (county versus municipality) is related to public support for UGD: impact fee revenue disbursed to municipal governments is associated with a higher rate of public support than comparable amounts disbursed to county governments, conditional on the respondent being aware of fracking prior to the survey. Our findings are consistent with the literature on public trust in local government and have implications for understanding the social feasibility of UGD in the United States and internationally.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"Although proponents praise natural gas as a clean and abundant energy source, the varying impacts and uncertainties surrounding the process of extracting natural gas from unconventional sources, known as horizontal high-volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) or “fracking,” have raised important concerns. This project explores public perceptions of the risks and beneficial opportunities associated with HVHF as recognized by the residents of two counties in Michigan, USA, one that currently produces natural gas by HVHF and one that does not. Through an analysis of media content related to HVHF in each case study site and interviews with stakeholders in both counties, this comparative study contributes to understanding the similarities in differences in perceptions of risks and opportunities in communities differently impacted by unconventional natural gas development, offering theoretical insight into the shared concerns and divergent perspectives among publics that have different experiences with HVHF, insight that provides new understandings of factors shaping community perceptions and means of improving environmental policy and water governance.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"Various energy sources are positioned as sustainable, assuming this may elicit positive evaluations of these sources, particularly among people who care about nature and the environment (i.e. have strong biospheric values). For example, the gas industry and some politicians position gas as a relatively clean fossil fuel and as a transition fuel towards future sustainable energy systems. But will people, particularly those who strongly endorse biospheric values, positively evaluate every energy development that is promoted as sustainable? We studied how sustainability claims affect evaluations of gas in the Netherlands. In line with what is commonly stated in practice, in a scenario study, we either presented natural gas as a relatively clean fossil fuel in current energy systems, or as a transition fuel in future energy systems with an increased share of renewables. Interestingly, stronger biospheric values were not associated with more positive evaluations of natural gas in either of these conditions. Yet, the stronger their biospheric values, the more positively respondents evaluated gas innovations, namely green gas and power-to-gas, which do not rely on fossil fuels. The findings demonstrate that merely sustainability claims may not allay the concerns that people have about the environmental consequences of some energy developments.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"In consideration of the size and geographic concentration of proved conventional gas reserves and the potential role of natural gas to reduce the carbon intensity of energy demand, unconventional gas resources have become increasingly important to expand natural gas supplies. Shale gas in particular has gained international relevance in recent years, largely due to its rapid development and game-changing effects in the United States and its wider and larger distribution worldwide over conventional gas reserves; nonetheless, developing shale gas in other countries has been much slower, as it presents increased risks that span multiple interlinked dimensions and differ across the perceptions of an ample array of stakeholders in diverse contextual settings. The premises presented in this paper attempt to advance a holistic framework for shale gas development which comprises several factors grouped in three major interlinked domains: access to natural resources, industry capabilities and governance. To empirically test its premises under contextual variations, the framework is further used to consistently analyze the cases of Canada, China and Mexico. Findings confirm the interdisciplinary nature of shale gas development and suggest that governance is the most critical domain to bring about changes that improve the management of underlying risks.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"Stalling progress in European, Chinese and Latin American shale has been attributed to difficult geological formations and lacking data. Yet, ‘above ground’ factors matter in the extractive industries as much as geology. It is policies, regulation and institutional settings that determines the success or failure of a contested, risk bound technology such as fracking. This article suggests that a regulatory governance agenda may offer novel insights into shale gas as a policy phenomenon. The article first provides a critical review of the existing literature on shale gas and identifies the key themes of security, social contestations and socio-economic impact. It then turns to assessing the literature on policy regimes, regulatory competition, regulatory path dependence and regulatory agencies which, it is argued, form essential elements of a research agenda for investigating unconventional gas as a regulatory governance problem. Building on these, the paper sketches focal points of investigations going forward.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"Australia could become the world’s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter by 2021. Especially the unconventional coal seam gas (CSG) reserves in the state of Queensland are developed at an unprecedented scale and pace. This rapid growth has intensified land use competition and, combined with concerns over associated extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing (‘fracking’), the CSG industry has prompted heated debates about its impacts. In this paper we present findings from our ethnographic fieldwork within Queensland’s gas fields and demonstrate how various actors respond differently to questions of risk and existing levels of knowledge. Highlighting this contingent nature of risk and knowledge, we caution against reductionist scientific understandings that suggest imaginary boundaries between knowledgeable experts and uninformed citizens. Rather, we argue for an anthropological perspective that allows to carefully think through the ways in which contentious subterranean resources such as CSG become known and how risks are socio-politically negotiated. This focus on the underlying politics of risk and knowledge is highly relevant to public debates over unconventional hydrocarbon developments and can address a central issue for the energy production in industrialized societies: the challenges of environmental change and the resulting socio-political negotiations of knowledge in the contemporary ‘risk society’.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"Many rural communities are facing complicated risks resulting from unconventional oil and gas development and hydraulic fracturing. This study focuses on residents’ experiences of risk and the factors limiting local leader’s efforts to protect residents. Data for this research were obtained through interviews with community leaders, industry officials, and focus groups with private citizens. Data collection occurred in four counties in the Eagle Ford Shale region of South Texas. Study participants shared examples of how their lives were impacted by increased truck traffic, food and housing insecurity, flaring of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas, and concerns about water contamination. Community leaders confront a tension between supporting economic growth and development associated with energy development, and managing these negative social and environmental outcomes. We identify three significant factors that weaken the power and limit the ability of local governments to effectively advocate for their communities. First, rural communities lack the staffing, expertise, and financial resources to properly cope with development. Second, the rural geography makes it difficult for local governments to work collaboratively across political borders. Third, the dominant conservative political values make it difficult for local leaders to advocate for increases in regional, state, or federal regulation.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"Given citizen concerns about damages that can accompany unconventional oil and gas development, some municipal governments have enacted zoning ordinances. Through a comparison of all municipalities to those with at least one oil or gas well, we examine factors that affect the adoption of local zoning laws by municipalities in Pennsylvania and find that lower educational levels, higher population densities, and higher incomes increase the likelihood of the municipalities endorsing zoning laws. A second analysis of spatial well data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection provides insights on factors associated with a higher density of wells and points out that municipalities with county zoning have a higher well density. Through an examination of the numbers of unconventional and conventional well types in municipalities, we find that higher incomes and education are associated with more horizontal drilling.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"Engaging with Australia’s nascent coal seam gas (CSG) industry reveals complex responsibilities and risks faced by contemporary universities. The relationship between science and society is shifting including universities’ relationships to private interests, technology and conceptualisations of knowledge as a ‘public good’ [28]. Understanding the material, political and economic forces that enable, shape or constrain knowledge is central to understanding contentious policy disputes. A more nuanced understanding of the economic and social conditions in which scientific knowledge is produced and absorbed, and a more careful examination of the institutional actors involved is sought [41], [43], [76], [77]. Toward that end, this article explores the dynamics of a university-industry partnership established in the contentious research and policy arena of CSG. It draws upon the authors’ experiences as participant-observers in an industry-funded research centre. These experiences have helped to characterise contradictions inherent in the demands on modern universities—private funding of research within public institutions, industry-driven research agendas, problem-solving with competing disciplinary epistemologies, and safeguarding the public interest as it relates to creation of knowledge to inform public policy decision-making. Such debates are of increasing importance as research can stimulate, or inhibit, major technological transitions in the energy arena.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"Energy-producing states confront numerous challenges related to the boom-and-bust of resource extraction, including substantial fluctuation in revenue produced by severance taxes. Revenues surge as drilling expands during booms, creating many pressures for immediate expenditure. This often sets up enormous strain during bust periods when revenues plunge as longer-term needs emerge. This paper, however, examines the small set of states that have devised unique mechanisms to prepare for future busts. It reviews two periods (1970s and 2010s) in which six oil and gas-producing states amended their state constitutions to place severance tax revenues into permanent trust funds for long-term stewardship. It examines the key political factors that prompted the formation of these funds while also considering their resilience and performance to date.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"Unconventional oil and gas extraction (from shale, coal, or tight sands) via hydraulic fracturing (often just ‘fracking’) has the potential to transform the US physical and political landscape.

"Shale gas in the EU and its Member States faces increasing attention from a regulatory perspective. Questions about the role of law regarding the development of shale gas extraction in Europe are being asked. The role of law within science, as Laurie et al. suggest, involves an important decision: “whether the law is an enabler or a prohibitor of technologies” (Laurie, G., Harmon, S.H., Arzuaga, F., ‘Foresighting Futures: Law, New Technologies, and the Challenges of Regulating for Uncertainty’ 4 Law, Innovation and Technology 1 (2012), 1–33, at 10) [1]. At best, the law should promote the development of a technology without unduly compromising the protection of society and the environment from consequences of uncertainties and potential threats of an associated technology (Laurie, G., Harmon, S.H., Arzuaga, F., ‘Foresighting Futures: Law, New Technologies, and the Challenges of Regulating for Uncertainty’ 4 Law, Innovation and Technology 1 (2012), 1–33, at 10) [2]. The principles of precaution and prevention are the two main tools of European law, which shall help to strike a balance between enabling and prohibiting the development of an emerging energy technology like shale gas extraction. This article departs from the perspective that law at EU level is imposing control on the management of “known” risks via the preventive principle. Regarding “uncertainties” or “unknowns”, decision makers are legally obliged to be guided by the precautionary principle. This paper discusses the two environmental law principles – precaution or prevention – and contemplates which of them would be most apt for guiding the regulation of shale gas extraction in Europe. It concludes that regulation on shale gas extraction could be based on either of these principles for different reasons.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"Our work examines the relationship between knowledge/familiarity with shale gas development in a comparative context. The United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) represent very different cases of shale gas development, with development relatively mature in the US whilst, no extraction of shale gas has yet commenced in the UK. Comparing results from two national level survey efforts in 2014, we find higher levels of knowledge about the shale gas industry in the UK than in the US, as well as higher levels of support in the US (opposition levels were similar, but US respondents were much less likely than UK respondents to say that they did not know whether they supported or opposed development). With respect to the relationship between knowledge and support, increased knowledge in the UK is associated with increased support, while knowledge was unrelated to support in the US. We anchor these results within the information deficit model of science, suggesting that concentrated media and governance in the UK have played an important role in producing the demonstrated effects.","Volume 20, Pages 1-178 (October 2016)",October 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/20/suppl/C,30
"The use of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and horizontal drilling technologies for recovering unconventional hydrocarbons (oil and gas) has created issues concerning the rights of property owners, energy companies, and others involved with the development and distribution of these resources. Constitutional provisions, legislative statutes, and jurisprudence on liability in the United States and Germany affect rights to oil and gas resources and the profitability of developing these resources. Legal rules for trespass, the rule of capture, pooling, unitization, and municipal fracturing bans circumscribe property rights associated with shale gas development in the United States. Germany, until setting up a specific, long-term legal regime on hydraulic fracturing, will rely on existing mining, water, and environmental legislation (as most recently modified).

We examine the self-efficacy of consumers who require the use of additional energy for medical reasons. Using data from two household national surveys in New Zealand carried out in 2011 and 2014 we demonstrate that medically vulnerable consumers have lower levels of self-efficacy in relation to energy decisions than non-medically vulnerable consumers. Consumers with low self-efficacy are less likely to manage their situation effectively. Current policy in New Zealand and elsewhere in the world requires vulnerable consumers to take action themselves which is less likely with low self-efficacy.,Volume 19,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/19/suppl/C,31
"The South Australian Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission has undertaken ‘an independent and comprehensive investigation into the potential for increasing South Australia’s participation in the nuclear fuel cycle’. In its Final Report, issued 6 May 2016, it acknowledges that nuclear power would not be commercially viable in South Australia in the foreseeable future. However it recommends that ‘the South Australian Government establish used nuclear fuel and intermediate level waste storage and disposal facilities in South Australia’. This is a business proposition to store a large fraction of global nuclear wastes, providing interim above-ground storage followed by permanent underground storage in South Australia. The present critical evaluation of the scheme finds that the Royal Commission’s economic analysis is based on many unsubstantiated assumptions. Furthermore, the scheme is financially risky for both Australian taxpayers and customers and has a questionable ethical basis.",Volume 19,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/19/suppl/C,31
"This paper examines collaborative relationships between architects and energy consultants, for the uptake and use of building performance simulation (BPS). BPS is thought to hold massive potential for the AEC industry, by allowing professionals to quantify impacts of architectural design-decisions. However, a number of technical barriers are widely-cited in the literature preventing the uptake of these tools. Instead, many architects collaborate with consultants for BPS uptake. It is hereby proposed that alongside technical barriers, additional non-technical barriers may arise when architects and consultants collaborate as a consequence of worldview differences. To enable exploration of potential barriers, the context of BPS is observed from a social lens focusing on the human dimension of interaction. Qualitative methods from the social sciences are used to extract some barriers; and a quantitative follow-up is performed to ascertain whether extracted barriers are similarly perceived amongst a larger sample of architects and consultants. Barriers identified include: negotiating control over decision-making, differences in problem-solving approaches, cliental roles and regulatory frameworks, professional trust and communication. Identification of these barriers constitutes a starting point to advance BPS research, encouraging a deeper examination of the social contexts in which BPS is used.",Volume 19,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/19/suppl/C,31
"People vary in their perceptions of wind turbines. Perceptions have been well-documented in European and North American studies and have been attributed to constructs like place attachment. Genius loci, or “spirit of a place,” is an ancient Roman idea that has new relevance in the study of landscape perceptions, including perceptions of wind turbines. As wind energy development expands to developing countries, new studies of public perceptions in unique cultural landscapes are required. We surveyed visitors to Nairobi National Park about their perceptions of the park landscape and the six-turbine Ngong Hills wind farm. Two complementary theories were used to analyze perceptions: place attachment and genius loci. The Ngong Hills Wind Farm had a slightly positive effect on the visitors who saw them. Additional turbine development would have no effect on their visitor experience but additional urban growth would have a very negative effect. Responses show that place attachment and genius loci explain aspects of visitor perceptions of the Nairobi National Park landscape. The human aspects of the landscape, including wind turbines and the Nairobi skyline, interact with the natural elements and the visitors’ own experiences to create a distinct genius loci and evokes feelings of place attachment.",Volume 19,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/19/suppl/C,31
"Building energy use research has largely been focused on technological performance despite growing evidence that human behavior has an equally significant role (Sovacool, 2014) [34]. This paper aims to address this by examining how the role of real-time information affects building occupant attitudes and behaviors toward energy use. Four buildings located on four different community college campuses in Illinois were outfitted with a centrally located graphic display of the building’s real-time energy use (an energy dashboard) and implemented a 6-week energy behavior change campaign. Intervention efficacy was tested with an online survey that was distributed to each campus population before and after the intervention. Pre-post analysis, comparison between exposed and unexposed populations, and cross-campus comparisons were then conducted. Our findings show that although the interventions resulted in significant energy savings (7–10% in electricity and 50% decrease in natural gas), differences in student and faculty/staff energy attitudes or behaviors proved insignificant. Post-intervention longitudinal interviews with building facility managers, however, showed that energy dashboards improved their ability to detect system faults that led to their implementation of energy-saving building adjustments. While energy dashboards can be effective at improving facility management approaches, they are less useful for measurably affecting occupant attitudes and behaviors.",Volume 19,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/19/suppl/C,31
"There is widespread agreement that the decarbonisation objectives of the smart grid agenda involve a reworking of the relationship between electricity supply and demand. Demand-side management on a household level requires changes in the temporality of electricity-consuming practices in everyday life. One dominant approach to demand-side management is to influence the temporality of households’ consumption patterns by providing economic incentives through variable electricity prices. This paper explores the temporal flexibility of Danish households’ electricity consumption through their participation in two smart grid projects: One is offering households to test an electric vehicle during five months and another is offering static time-of-use pricing. Based on qualitative interviews and hourly-recorded electricity metering data with families living in single-family detached homes, the paper shows that the combined trial influenced the households to time shift consumption from high-tariff to low-tariff hours in relation to three consumption areas: dishwashing, laundering and charging of electric vehicles. The analysis goes beyond this apparent flexibility and explores how time shifting of energy demand challenges the temporality of households’ routinised everyday practices. The study recommends that future smart grid interventions acknowledge the temporal complexity and dynamics of interwoven social practices and how this affects the potential for time shifting energy demand.",Volume 19,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/19/suppl/C,31

In contrast, research on gender differences in environmental or energy policy-making is rather sparse and yields inconclusive results. But more recent research on gender in environmental policy-making provides empirical evidence that female legislators make a difference in policy outcome. This paper contributes to this research by analyzing the legislative behavior of female and male legislators in energy policy-making in Germany and the United States for both roll call votes and legislative debates.

"Competition has become an increasingly popular strategy to engage individuals in energy and resource conservation; however, there has not been an objective, independent review of existing competition programs focusing on the reduction of energy use. This paper attempts to address this shortcoming.This paper reviews a representative selection of completed and ongoing energy reduction competitions in the United States and uses the lessons learned to provide best practice guidance on the design, implementation, and evaluation of future programs. Four key research questions are addressed in this study:•How effective have competitions been at changing behavior and reducing energy?•How long do energy savings persist after the end of competitions?•Under what circumstances are competitions more or less effective?•What are common best practices for the design, implementation and evaluation of energy and resource conservation competitions?The primary target audiences for this paper are electric and natural gas utilities seeking to broaden their portfolio of behavior-based interventions, as well as potential designers, implementers and evaluators of energy reduction competitions.

"Improving the design and implementation of interventions to encourage end-use energy efficiency has the potential to contribute a substantive reduction in carbon emissions. A plethora of behaviour change frameworks is available to guide policymakers and designers but none have been found to be comprehensive or well-used. A new framework – the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) – purports to be a useful aid for developing all types of behaviour change interventions. This paper assesses whether the BCW comprehensively describes programmes attempting to reduce energy consumption. To do this, components of behaviour change programmes as identified in four EU guidance documents were mapped onto the BCW. Most of the components discussed in the guidance could be readily coded to the BCW framework. The main energy policy under-represented in the BCW was energy price. Based on our work in this paper, we believe that the BCW offers a useful aid for the systematic design and development of behaviour change around end-use energy efficiency. We also propose that it may support development of a common lexicon for activities that can be rather vaguely described currently in energy efficiency guidance.",Volume 19,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/19/suppl/C,31
"Despite indications that they could play an important part in shaping how people heat their homes, central heating installers have been largely overlooked in energy research. As a means of addressing this oversight, this paper draws on a British ethnographic study to explore the ways in which these ‘missing middlemen’ can be said to comprise a ‘community of practice’. Two aspects of community membership are explored in detail: social learning processes and shared identities. This exercise shows how socially acquired understandings of their professional role and their relationship with homeowners can influence the selection and installation of heating products. The paper concludes with suggestions for how industry and policy makers might engage with this group. These suggestions focus on strategies aimed at reducing the energy used for home heating, and the installation of alternative heating technologies, both of which might benefit from an appreciation of the informal processes of community formation.",Volume 19,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/19/suppl/C,31
"Three recent “roadmap” analyses outline routes to a low-carbon economy that model the decarbonization of the electricity sector and the pervasive electrification of the transportation and industrial sectors. Using independent cost estimates and sequentially “relaxing” the constraints on resource selection, this paper compares the resource costs of the resulting portfolios of assets needed to meet the need for electricity. It supports the claim that the long run costs of the 100% renewable portfolios are less than business-as-usual portfolios, and finds that the “environmental merit order” of asset selection is quite close to the “economic merit order.” Neither fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage nor nuclear power enters the least-cost, low-carbon portfolio. Rigorous least-cost constraints on decarbonization render the pollution constraint is superfluous. The paper evaluates the Paris Agreement on climate change in light of these findings. The Agreement is described as a progressive, mixed market economic model with a governance structure based on a polycentric, multi-stakeholder approach for management of a common pool resource. It also notes that the political economy of the Agreement is consistent with current academic analysis of policy responses to the challenges of climate change and management of a large, focal core resource system.",Volume 19,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/19/suppl/C,31
"In the Western United States, widespread growth of wind and solar resources is putting pressure on state policy makers, electricity system operators, and utilities to integrate renewable resources into the grid, while maintaining reliability, affordability, and improving efficiency.

This paper examines a recent initiative to make energy imbalance market services available throughout the Western Interconnection and provides insight into evolving electricity system governance.

"Transmission grid development is key for the decarbonization of our energy systems, but has not been much addressed within the social sciences of energy studies. This paper addresses this gap and examines institutional barriers for developing the grid towards a decarbonized Nordic power system by 2050. The analysis focuses on current grid development practices from an institutional perspective to understand barriers and drivers to grid development for the case of Sweden. The results show that the transmission grid development regime is generally capable of implementing the grid investments needed to support a decarbonized Nordic power system, but that there are a few key barriers that need to be addressed. From this analysis we deduce possible governance options that could alleviate the barriers, enabling the development of the transmission grid that is needed for the Nordic power grid to become decarbonized by 2050.",Volume 19,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/19/suppl/C,31
"Energy law is gaining prominence among legal subjects. In the three spheres of academic, professional and public life, there is an increasing realization of the potential importance of energy law. The underlying objective of this paper is to contribute to the creation of a theory of energy law through advancing what this should encompass. Energy law has addressed particular issues in the energy sector but it has not had a holistic view of the sector, in particular, concerning the issue of energy waste management, which remains a serious problem. The conditions for a more holistic approach to manage energy resources are emerging and in the future it may be expected that energy law will have a core theoretical framework. This framework is important as it will in essence provide energy law with a ‘spirit’ or a raison d’être. The theory proposed here is on the Evolution of Energy Law and the centre-point of this theoretical perspective is that to-date there have been Five Stages in the Evolution of Energy Law. In understanding what have been the key stages (or drivers) in the development of energy law it will give the energy law scholar an understanding of the motivation(s) behind the formulation of energy law.",Volume 19,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/19/suppl/C,31

"The consumption of energy services for everyday mobility and domestic life is a fundamental pre-condition for participating in many contemporary societies, but it can also impact upon current and future generations in ways that raise questions of equity and fairness. Whilst the field of ‘energy justice’ has become more established in recent years, much work remains to be done to further this area of study. In this lead article for a Special Issue on ‘Energy demand for mobility and domestic life: new insights from energy justice’, we begin by outlining the many interlocking issues of (in)justice raised by energy consumption for mobility and domestic services, identifying gaps in the current literature. We then describe the articles within the Special Issue, discussing these in relation to three themes: uneven access to energy and transport services; the unequal burdens of low-carbon policies; and reducing energy demand and the good society. We conclude by highlighting potential directions for future research; for example, conceptualising ‘excessive’ consumption as an issue of (in)justice, and identifying low-energy social practices and arrangements that simultaneously contribute to human well-being.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32
"This paper investigates the issue of fuel poverty and of its measurement in the transport sector. We seek to identify households who run the risk of facing difficulties if fuel prices increase. We show that fuel poverty indicators from the domestic sector are not satisfactory in this regard. They fail to take into account three specificities of the transport sector: (1) the diversity of travel needs, (2) restriction behaviours, and (3) variable capacities to adapt. We propose a composite indicator that targets factors of vulnerabilities. In contrast to the previous indicators, it does not solely focus on budgetary aspects but also reflects conditions of mobility. Three levels of exposition to rising fuel prices are considered, depending on the combinations of factors. We test this indicator on French data and find that 7.8% of French households are identified fuel poor, a further 7.4% fuel vulnerable and a further 3.7% fuel dependent.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32

However, the specific forms of energy services deprivation differ between European countries. This paper explores an analytical framework of energy poverty at the macro-scale, based firstly on energy services deprivation and secondly on an analysis of energy inequality, where energy inequality relates to the fact that different household groups are not affected in the same way by energy services deprivation. This framework allows for a comparison between EU countries and discloses their relative affectedness. Policy implications with respect to the differing fuel poverty problems and recommendations are discussed.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32
"Energy poverty, understood as deprivation of energy services linked to satisfy human basic needs, is a strengthened research topic which is gaining relevance in Social Sciences. We point out that energy poverty affects millions of families in Mexico, so there is a need for overcoming this social justice problem. Hence, this paper presents a methodological framework to characterize families according to their levels of deprivation of energy services and, furthermore, identify the determining factors of these different levels of deprivation. Our results indicate that five groups of homes exist: one which does not lack any energy service; two which lack only one energy service; and two which lack the majority of energy services. Those variables which most precisely explain the probability that a home be found in each of these groups are per-capita income, size of settlement (urban or rural), and type of climate. We conclude our findings have public policy implications in that, upon characterizing households based on their level of deprivation of energy services, sound strategies may be designed and implemented to attend to the specific needs of each household group.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32
"The study assesses the impact of energy service provision in The Gambian settlement of Kartong through a qualitative study that employs immersion and mapping methods. In time for the 2013 Ramadan celebrations, the first 19 households are connected to a regional electricity grid. Shortly after a bus service is introduced that runs from Kartong to Banjul, the capital city of The Gambia. It provides a reliable alternative to so-called bush taxis that operate without a set schedule. While the provision of energy services including electricity and transport is recognized as important in supporting people’s livelihoods, it poses questions about a shift from energy self-sufficiency to increased dependency on outside resources. Locally there is also an increased emphasis regarding inequality in accessing these services. For example, grid infrastructure is currently limited to the longer established parts of Kartong, putting households on the edge of the settlement in a disadvantaged position.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32
"Fuel poverty is a problem particularly associated with the lives and living conditions of older people, in part because of their vulnerability to health impacts. This article draws attention to the ways in which older people on low incomes cope with and adapt to problems of affording to keep warm at home. We present findings from interviews with 17 households during the winter of 2012–2013 in England. The importance of keeping warm was recognised across the interviews. Four particular categories of coping strategies were defined and used—responsively adjusting the length of time and parts of the home for which heating is kept on, using secondary heating sources; using additional layers that help to keep bodies warm; and adjusting daily routines. We found that it was rare for people themselves to problematize the ways in which they were coping day to day, they largely just saw this as what they did to get by and to control the size of their energy bills. Coping strategies raise questions about what are acceptable living conditions, how judgments are made and how assistance can be provided when householders do not themselves problematize their situation. Implications for action to tackle fuel poverty are considered.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32
"Targets for reductions in carbon emissions and energy use are often framed solely in terms of percentage reductions. However, the amount of energy used by households varies greatly, with some using considerably more than others and, therefore, potentially being able to make a bigger contribution towards overall reductions. Using two recently released UK datasets based on combined readings from over 70 million domestic energy meters and vehicle odometers, we present exploratory analyses of patterns of direct household energy usage.Whilst much energy justice work has previously focussed on energy vulnerability, mainly in low consumers, our findings suggest that a minority of areas appear to be placing much greater strain on energy networks and environmental systems than they need. Households in these areas are not only the most likely to be able to afford energy efficiency measures to reduce their impacts, but are also found to have other capabilities that would allow them to take action to reduce consumption (such as higher levels of income, education and particular configurations of housing type and tenure). We argue that these areas should therefore be a higher priority in the targeting of policy interventions.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32
"In the context of climate change, governments and international organizations often promote a “sustainable lifestyle.” However, this approach has been criticized for underestimating the complexity of everyday life and therefore being inapplicable to households and consumers. In addition, procedures for promoting sustainable consumption seldom incorporate domestic workers’ opinions and often increase women’s housework loads. This article employs a practice-based approach to examine the “Energy-Saving, Carbon Reduction” movement, a series of sustainable consumption policies that have been advocated by the Taiwanese government since 2008. The goal of the movement is to encourage an eco-friendly lifestyle.

"Utility regulation in the United States (US) was founded partly on a consensus that raw marketplace economics ignored social justice, including universal service goals. The century-old ‘regulatory compact’ in most jurisdictions offers ‘just and reasonable rates’ in exchange for investment in public services. Justice has come to justify such low-income supports as discounted rates, arrearage forgiveness, limitations on service termination, and low/no cost energy efficiency. The consensus for regulation has now evolved to encompass carbon reduction, and has led to, amongst other things, the promotion of domestic forms of renewable energy known as ‘distributed generation’ (DG). However, such technologies potentially threaten the current regulatory balance that includes ameliorating energy poverty, because DG reduces utility sales but not utility fixed costs and so contributes to higher bills for low-income households that cannot afford such DG investments as rooftop solar, solar domestic hot water, and cogeneration.The aim of this paper is to analyze how utility regulation might evolve to encompass modern energy developments, thus addressing both the goals of reducing carbon and amerliorating fuel poverty. It begins by reviewing the origin of US utility regulation and describes the regulatory compact that resulted. It then discusses possible balancing measures, including tax-based subsidies, system benefit charges (taxes) on DG, stricter application of just and reasonable regulatory principles, and low-income-specific approaches to DG.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32
"Mobility systems raise multiple questions of justice. Work on mobility justice and policy often treats different elements of the debate separately, for example focussing on environmental justice or accessibility. This is problematic as it can privilege policy solutions without a full view of the winners and losers and the values implicit in that. Using analysis of current policy, we investigate how mobility justice can reconcile its different components, and find two major consequences. First, is doubt about the justice of the existing policy approach which tries to tackle transport pollution primarily through a shift to low emission vehicles. This approach privileges those with access to private vehicles and further privileges certain sets of activities. Second is a need to reassess which basic normative ideas should be applied in mobility justice. Work on mobility justice has tended to appeal to conceptions of justice concerned with access to resources including resources enabling mobility. These conceptions say little about how resources should be used. We show that avoiding stark inequalities means collectively thinking about how resources are used, about how we value activities involving mobility, and about what sorts of goods and services we create.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32
"The amount of energy and carbon emissions that is required to satisfy transport needs in developed countries is high, has increased rapidly in the past few decades, and is likely to continue to do so in the future. In some contexts, such as car-dependent peri-urban and rural areas, the satisfaction of basic needs has come to depend on extensive use of carbon-intensive transport modes. This creates a tension between social and environmental sustainability, and gives rise to justice dilemmas. In this article, a novel framework is proposed to conceptualise the connections and tensions between justice in transport and accessibility, on one hand, and the consequences of transport emissions on global and intergenerational justice, on the other hand. The framework is based on the integration of philosophical (human needs theory) and sociological (structuration theory) perspectives. While human needs are anthropological invariants, need satisfiers are relative, contextual and historical. Over time, satisfiers can become more travel- and carbon-intensive through unintentional structuration processes. This encourages a critical look towards how the role of transport in need satisfaction has changed over time, how it might change in the future, and the role of ‘excess travel’ practices in pushing the envelope of transport needs.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32
"Access to affordable energy is a core dimension of energy justice, with recent work examining the relation between energy use and well-being in these terms. However, there has been relatively little examination of exactly which energy uses should be considered basic necessities within a given cultural context and so of concern for energy justice. We examine the inclusion of energy-using necessities within the outcomes of deliberative workshops within members of the public focused on defining a minimum-standard of living in the UK and repeated biannually over a six year period. Our secondary analysis shows that energy uses deemed to be necessities are diverse and plural, enabling access to multiple valued energy services, and that their profile has to some degree shifted from 2008 to 2014. The reasoning involved is multidimensional, ranging across questions of health, social participation, opportunity and practicality. We argue that public deliberations about necessities can be taken as legitimate grounding for defining minimum standards and therefore the scope of ‘doing justice’ in fuel poverty policy. However we set this in tension with how change over time reveals the escalation of norms of energy dependency in a society that on climate justice grounds must radically reduce carbon emissions.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32
"New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions profile is somewhat different from many highly urbanised countries. Just under half of greenhouse gas emissions are associated with agriculture, with much less from transport. However, transport-related greenhouse gas emissions have increased rapidly and at a faster rate than most other sources since 1990. The challenge for New Zealand (and many other countries) is to promote forms of transport which do not contribute to that increase, whilst at the same time ensuring that the residents outside main urban centres have access to employment, education, health, business and other services that may be at some distance. Research into travel by residents of small towns in New Zealand suggests flexible shared transport has considerable potential to enhance the social and economic well-being of the population in small towns and cities. It can enable residents to travel to larger regional centres for necessary services at the same whilst reducing the energy use associated with single occupant vehicles. New digital platforms offer scope for flexible shared transport to overcome the barriers faced by many public transport providers. Therefore, transport policy-makers and planners need to see flexible transport as a key element in a low carbon, socially and economically inclusive transport system, and actively support its expansion.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32
"Despite the potential of utility cycling to contribute to a more resilient, just, and environmentally sustainable transport system, its mode share in New Zealand has remained persistently low. Efforts to increase utility cycling have been pursued by government authorities through a range of supportive strategies. This paper explores the disparity between this policy intent and outcome. It draws on a discourse analytical approach to examine how utility cycling has been positioned in transport policy documents alongside other priorities. Transport-related policy and strategy documents for the period 2008–2013 from central government, and regional and city councils are analysed. The analysis reveals how changing use and meaning for the term ‘sustainable’ has narrowed transport objectives, restricting outcomes that address the pillars of environmental and social sustainability. It demonstrates how transport policy has been framed as a driver of economic growth, how this has been interpreted as requiring a narrow range of transport policy solutions, contributing to the devaluing of utility cycling, despite its potential (and existing) impact on health and well-being, social justice, and environmental sustainability. These practices have systematically privileged motor vehicle use, helping to legitimate and maintain that privilege, while marginalising utility cycling as an effective mode of transport.","Volume 18, Pages 1-162 (August 2016)",August 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/18/suppl/C,32

"Encouraging pro-environmental behaviour at work can result in a significant reduction in environmental problems. Research revealed that general environmental considerations such as biospheric values and environmental self-identity are important antecedents of private pro-environmental behaviour. Yet, the question remains whether such general environmental considerations also predict pro-environmental behaviour at work. We propose a parsimonious theoretical model (the VIP-model) in which biospheric values affect personal norms to behave pro-environmentally at work and pro-environmental actions via the environmental self-identity. A study involving a diverse sample of employees from different European organizations supported the VIP-model, showing that biospheric values and environmental self-identity influence personal norms, and that stronger personal norms encouraged various self-reported pro-environmental behaviours at work to some extent. The VIP-model yields promising, cost-efficient strategies to encourage pro-environmental behaviour at work.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"Discussions about the opening of science to society have led to the emergence of new fields such as sustainability science and transformative science. At the same time, the megatrend of stakeholder participation reached the academic world and thus scientific research processes. This challenges the way science is conducted and the tools, methods and theories perceived appropriate. Although researchers involve stakeholders, the scientific community still lacks comprehensive theoretical analysis of the practical processes behind their integration – for example what kind of perceptions scientists have about their roles, their objectives, the knowledge to gather, their understanding of science or the science-policy interface. Our paper addresses this research gap by developing four ideal types of stakeholder involvement in science − the technocratic, the functionalist, the neoliberal-rational and the democratic type. In applying the typology, which is based on literature review, interviews and practical experiences, we identify and discuss three major criticisms raised towards stakeholder involvement in science: the legitimacy of stakeholder claims, the question whether bargaining or deliberation are part of the stakeholder involvement process and the question of the autonomy of science. Thus, the typology helps scientists to better understand the major critical questions that stakeholder involvement raises and enables them to position themselves when conducting their research.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"We analyzed how internal factors (e.g., value orientations or attitudes) and external factors (e.g., incentives or social influences) affect households’ decisions to make an investment in solar thermal energy, and how these factors interact in the decision process. 232 German home owners were questioned using an online survey. Internal factors were measured in the form of value orientations. The influence of external factors was measured in a discrete choice experiment, which covered economic consequences, social influences and ecologic consequences. The data was analyzed using mixed logit models. We found decision makers with strong eco-social value orientations to be more likely to make an investment while strong conservative and strong hedonistic value orientations both reduced investment likelihood. Among the external factors, economic consequences and investment recommendations by trustworthy sources were found highly important. Ultimately, we found several interactions between value orientations and external factors: decision makers with strong conservative or strong hedonistic value orientations are more sensitive towards economic consequences; decision makers with strong eco-social value orientations, however, are more sensitive towards recommendations and ecological consequences of an investment. Our results propose that strategies fostering households’ investments in renewable energies should be appropriately adjusted for different groups of decision makers.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"To decarbonise its electricity system, Europe must rapidly expand renewables. We analyse the controversy between two organisations, Eurosolar and Desertec, which seemingly pursue the same goal of 100% renewable electricity. We show that they interpret “100% renewables” differently and envision fundamentally different renewable electricity futures, to be reached through different governance pathways driven by different actors. Desertec reacts to mankind’s violation of the Earth’s carrying capacity and seeks secure decarbonisation through renewables, for which centrally regulated, large-scale imports of controllable concentrating solar power from the desert are necessary. Eurosolar, in contrast, seeks to decentralise the electricity supply and disempower the actors who caused the unsustainable and undemocratic energy system, for which renewables are suited as they are carbon-neutral and decentralised by nature. As the core aim of Desertec, controllable solar power imports through large-scale infrastructure, violates Eurosolar’s core aim of decentralisation, a compromise is difficult: this would require one organisation to give up its primary objective. Our results show that the reason for this controversy among renewables proponents lies not in technology or cost, and can thus not be identified or resolved through techno-economic analysis or modelling, but in irreconcilable differences in normative aims and governance choices.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"Increasingly, local opposition to new electricity grid developments cause lengthy delays and places financial and practical strain on the projects. The structure of the electricity industry is in transition due to the emergence of smaller but more numerous generation facilities. Also, the wider society and local communities increasingly engage with energy and environmental issues. At the same time, the traditional decision making frameworks and processes are proving less effective in solving the present time conflicts between local communities and other stakeholders. This paper proposes an economic approach to resolve such conflicts. We discuss how compensation, benefit sharing, and property rights can have a role in reducing community opposition to grid development. However, we argue that these methods need to be part of an overarching policy towards conflict resolution in grid development. We then propose that such impacts can be addressed within a ‘weak’ versus ‘strong’ sustainability framework. Finally, we suggest that the concepts of ‘collective negotiation’ and ‘menu of options’ in regulatory economics can be adapted to operationalise the suggested sustainability-based approach to arrive at more efficient and socially desirable outcomes. The proposed framework can lead to the identification of socially acceptable outcomes that could otherwise have gone undetected.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"The aim of this paper is to study the role of user imaginaries in relation to electric cars and the role these imaginaries play in the ongoing transition towards electrification of the transport sector. We conducted interviews with a diverse group of stakeholders to explore how imaginaries of the public are constructed and how the shared expectations of a user trajectory shaped by user groups with different concerns and different expected technology developments influence policy. We identified a range of implications and influences of this shared imagination for different aspects of the development of strategies and policies related to electrification of the transport sector in Norway. Finally, we discuss how these user imaginaries, that we call imagined publics, appear to have become part of the process of sociotechnical changes and what the consequences may be for a transformation to sustainable mobility.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"Public opposition to the construction (i.e., siting) of new high voltage overhead transmission lines is not a new or isolated phenomenon. Past research has posited a variety of reasons, applied general theories, and has provided empirical evidence to explain public opposition. The existing literature, while clarifying many elements of the issue, does not yet fully explain the complexities underlying this public opposition phenomenon. The current study demonstrated how two overlooked factors, people’s sense of political efficacy and their familiarity (i.e., prior exposure) with transmission lines, explained attitudes of support and opposition to siting new power lines.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"Workplaces worldwide are a major source of carbon emissions and changing energy use behaviour in these environments has the capacity for large carbon savings. This paper reviews and synthesises empirical evidence to identify what types of behaviour change intervention are most successful at saving energy in an office-type workplace. We draw on the field of health-related behaviour change interventions and adopt the Behaviour Change Wheel (Michie et al., 2014) as a framework through which to assess the success of the interventions reviewed here (n = 22 studies). We find that interventions creating social and physical opportunities for employees to save energy are the most successful i.e. which constitute Enablement (including direct support and greater control to employees), Environmental Restructuring (particularly automated and retrofitted technologies) and Modelling (various forms of social influence). The communal nature of most workplaces demands scrutiny to understand the effect of social influences. We provide recommendations for future research, including the need to consider forms of intervention not yet researched; Coercion, Restriction, and Training. We conclude by calling for further, well evaluated, energy saving behavioural interventions in a variety of workplaces to identify those techniques which offer the greatest success in saving energy and thus reducing carbon emissions.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"The increased public attention to hydraulic fracturing as a technique for extracting natural gas has raised the stakes of the political and regulatory struggle that surround it. This increased attention has also raised questions about the levels of popular support or opposition to the technique. Before we can assess this support or opposition, we must have a firm understanding of the language and framing of language of these extractive technologies. This paper uses a survey experiment to compare two popular framing languages for hydraulic fracturing, with half of the respondents receiving questions that refer to the technique as “hydraulic fracturing” and the other half, as “fracking”. We analyzed the effects of framing for the two treatments by conducting t-tests to compare responses to questions concerning opinions and attitudes about the extraction technique. The results illustrate that the concerns that the term “fracking” is politicized and pejorative are overstated. The survey reveals that familiarity with the technique influences levels of support and reactions to specific wording, but there is no general framing effect for the use of one wording over the other.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"A growing body of literature has examined the dynamics of wind energy development across different mature and emerging institutional contexts. However, so far only few have paused to reflect on the differences between developed and emerging economies. Building upon the literature on institutional entrepreneurship, this paper compares institutional strategies in wind energy development in Finland and India by using the typology of political, technical and cultural work. We highlight the role of institutional approaches in studying sustainable energy transitions in mature and emerging institutional contexts, while being sensitive to the role of heterogeneous actors in shaping institutional arrangements. Our findings offer implications for debates in the institutional entrepreneurship literature by exploring how actors shape their institutional environment in different contexts, and the extent to which emerging institutional contexts provide more opportunities for institutional entrepreneurship. Finally, this paper underscores the need for developing insights into enabling conditions for successful collective institutional entrepreneurship and for developing typologies of institutional strategies which are generalizable across both mature and emerging institutional contexts.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"In this paper, I aim to explain why global oil companies created different governance structures to deal with similar challenges. I test several hypotheses derived from transaction cost economics. These hypotheses link movements in asset specificity and uncertainty to changes in the level of hierarchy and political involvement of governance structures. To test these hypotheses, I conduct a crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis of seven important governance changes. The analysis leads to the following preliminary theory: increasing and highly volatile global oil production as well as declining market positions for important actors create long-term pressure for governance change. But they do not trigger this change, nor do they predetermine the form it will take. Actors actually change governance structures in reaction to more recent events. They will try to increase government involvement, if they face a more uncertain environment or contradictory market trends. They will more likely prefer stronger hierarchy at a given level of government involvement, if they have to deal with an increasingly diverse market environment.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"In a world in which rising powers are reconfiguring global development trajectories with significant implications for their sustainability, it becomes increasingly important to understand whether and how low carbon energy transitions might be enabled or frustrated by this new global geography of power. Towards this end, this paper makes the case for bringing together insights from three broad sets of literature on: (1) socio-technical transitions; (2) the rising powers as (re)emerging development donors and; (3) energy geographies. In building bridges between these three bodies of scholarship we seek to develop an alternative analytical framework that attends more effectively to the global and domestic political economy of transitions and whose value is illustrated empirically in relation to the growing involvement of Brazil, India and China in the energy systems of Mozambique and South Africa. We argue that this alternative framework provides a better understanding of how the rising powers are influencing the changing relationships between low carbon and fossil-fuel based energy pathways and of the multiple roles they are playing in the development and transformation of energy systems, through the development of ‘niches’ where innovation can emerge, or in reinforcing or challenging existing ‘regimes’ or dominant ways of providing energy services.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"Governments in several European countries have developed policies that encourage companies to share ownership of renewable energy projects with local communities. Shared ownership presumes that company and community actors have common goals, can form effective partnerships and negotiate fair outcomes. But there is a lack of research on shared ownership, in particular, how it is constructed by different actors, and the role of trust in shaping practice. This study addressed this gap, drawing on qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 19 UK stakeholders from industry, community and advisory backgrounds. Thematic analysis revealed strong support for shared ownership in principle, but significant challenges in practice. Actors held different rationales and contrasting views on whether the policy should be discretionary or mandatory. A lack of trust was prevalent, with developers expressing skepticism regarding the capacities and representativeness of community actors; and community actors viewing developers as solely motivated by profit, instrumentally using communities to gain planning consent. We conclude that for shared ownership to become conventional practice, it will be necessary to provide mechanisms that facilitate partner identification at an early stage, which can help to build relations of trust between actors, within a more stable and supportive policy context.",Volume 17,July 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/17/suppl/C,33
"The current paper calculates an Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare Growth (ISEW) for 42 Sub- Saharan African (SSA) countries for the years 1985–2013. Then it uses the calculated indicator as a proxy for sustainable income in place of GDP to re-estimate the energy-ISEW nexus. Besides energy consumption, additional independent variables are: capital, CO2 emissions, rents, trade and inflation. Perusing panel data cointegration analysis and Granger causality, results are compared with the ones from the conventional energy-GDP growth nexus and we find evidence of the feedback hypothesis when the ISEW is used in place of GDP.

"In the last decade, Arctic energy research has been dominated by a focus on oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction. This is introductory article to an Energy Research & Social Science special issue, entitled “Arctic Energy: Views from the Social Sciences,” challenges this approach and offers a broader and more inclusive perspective on Arctic energy research. In reflecting this perspective, some of the articles investigate social, economic, political, and environmental aspects of oil and gas development in the region while offering critiques of such development’s processes and initiatives, both of which are usually seen in a positive light. Other articles target non-fossil sources and types of energy, thereby providing a view of the Arctic as a living laboratory for energy services. The special issue’s broad and inclusive perspective is also represented by the diverse disciplinary, professional, and ethnic backgrounds of the contributing authors, as well as the range of conceptual and methodological approaches.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34
"This article describes Russian Arctic policy agendas as they have been reflected in mainstream Russian media outlets. The research was based on modeling topic structures of three federal and three regional newspapers. Topic modeling was performed with the unsupervised LDA algorithm and complemented with hand labelling of topics. Data was collected by retrieval of relevant newspaper articles from the media database Integrum for the period 2011–2015 (N = 611); the corpus was further divided in two periods (2011–2013 and 2014–2015) to account for the potential effect of the Ukrainian crisis on agenda-setting. Both federal and regional newspapers were found to have been mostly concerned with the development of hydrocarbon resources, as coverage of this topic was the largest during both periods. However, during the second period (2014–2015), the repercussions of the Ukrainian crisis, namely the economic sanctions and securitization, gained significant attention while marginalizing other topics. The results of this analysis may serve as a foundation for application of sentiment analysis to allow an in-depth understanding of topic salience and impact on public opinion.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34
"Recent research has identified a series of human geography impacts of natural resource developments in sparsely populated areas like the Arctic. These impacts can be mapped to the ‘resource cycle’, and arise from periods of population growth and decline, changing patterns of human migration and mobility, changing patterns of settlement, and changes in the demographic ‘balance’ between males and females, young and old, Indigenous and non-Indigenous. This paper examines the applicability of the resource cycle model in the case of hydro energy development in the Jokkmokk municipality of Sweden. Using quantitative demographic data, media reports, and contemporary accounts of hydro development, the paper describes the human geography of Jokkmokk since the late 19th century. The paper concludes that changes in human geography in Jokkmokk mirror what has been observed in regions dependent on non-renewable resources, although it is difficult to distinguish many impacts from those that might have occurred under alternative development scenarios. The paper identifies a ‘settlement cycle’ with phases of integrated and separated habitation for populations specifically associated with the development. Settlement dynamics, and the impacts of hydro on Sami geography are areas for further research.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34
"This article examines perceptions of petroleum developments in the Norwegian Arctic town of Hammerfest, especially in the context of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Based on eighteen semi-structured interviews conducted in Hammerfest, the perceived effects of petroleum developments are identified and discussed. Local support for petroleum activity is high, particularly given the upsurge in job opportunities and economic ripple effects, both of which are considered essential to the community's survival. Environmental concerns and opposition to oil and gas are largely ascribed to external forces and do not feature as much in the locals’ perceptions. While CSR is not part of the interviewees' vocabulary, the local population has clear expectations and views about petroleum companies' responsibilities to their community. In order to grasp the full picture of the Arctic petroleum debate, it is important to acknowledge that expectations, desires, and reality on the ground will sometimes diverge strongly from non-local considerations.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34
"The presence of a developed and visible risk management1 (RM) and/or risk governance (RG) system has been highly institutionalised and discoursed in all kinds of modern activities. Based on the case of an oil-producing company operating in the Russian Arctic, the purpose of this paper is to challenge the organising (everything) capability of the risk concept showing that RM may exist between the everything-nothing extremums. By advocating the practice-based approach to organisational RG, the paper studies how the concepts of risk are used (or not used) in handling hazardous activities among different groups of professionals in a nature-exposed context. When following the mainstream of research on risk in the extreme conditions of the Arctic context one would expect the “risk” concept to be present in all practices throughout the company. However, the findings indicate that—apart from practices aimed at building the public sector of the company—the majority of practices carried out daily amid the challenges of the Arctic context do not even allow “risk” into their vocabulary. Instead, due to deeply inherited tacit knowledge of the context and intense entwinement of practices, their uncertainties are seasonally predictable and expected. As a result, RG within the company includes a range of various risk-displacing practices rather than an all-encompassing RM system.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34
"Recent explanations of regional path development tend to neglect public policy interventions into the analysis of new path creation in non-core regions. I argue that the evolutionary approach in economic geography effort in highlighting endogenous theories to explain industrial renewal in the periphery, should be more aware of theories of exogenous inflows from outside in order to explain innovation and growth in regions. I suggest that the concept of local content policies in the global petroleum industry is pivotal in understanding regions ability to break out of trajectories seen as path dependent in theories of regional development. Drawing on a combination of studies of two petroleum projects in the region of Finnmark and one in Nordland in Northern Norway, this paper explores recent local content initiatives, and evaluate their potential benefit for companies and regions. I argue that the role of policy actions should be a pivotal issue in explaining growth and innovation in peripheral areas, and that a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors gives a more balanced picture of the situation rather than leaning on endogenous factors alone.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34
"For the past three decades, risk has occupied center stage in the energy discourse. Systemic risks have proven particularly challenging for government energy planners and corporate executives, as they are characterized by their complexity, uncertainty, ambiguity, and ability to causing ripple effects throughout economic, social, and political structures. In this article we analyze two approaches to governing systemic risks arising out of energy megaprojects, one mandated under the Russian legal and regulatory regime and one employed by the largely indigenous hunters, fishermen, and reindeer herders residing in the Sakha Republic. Our study focuses on the 4000-km-long natural gas transmission system “Power of Siberia” to be constructed in the sub-Arctic part of the region. We employ a complimentary and corroborative analysis of legal texts, fieldwork observations, semi-structured interviews, and transcripts of official meetings. We establish that the approach to risk taken by the people who occupy the land that the Power of Siberia traverses could provide a useful insight for handling systemic risks in connection with pipeline transportation systems. We also determine that the current Russian legal and regulatory regime fails to provide an adequate basis for governing such risks. We conclude the article by identifying four pathways for integrating valuable elements of the indigenous approach into the current legal and regulatory framework.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34
"Until recently energy and minerals development were seen as a promising way for Greenland to earn the revenues to gain full independence from Denmark. Yet with the collapse in the price of oil in 2014, a future that is reliant on commodity markets is looking less certain. This paper looks at Greenland's hydrocarbon sector through the lens of corporate social responsibility. Greenland's business community has a well-developed sense of what CSR means in the Greenlandic context, while foreign companies have introduced the need to systematise these values as business strategy and policies. A weakness in the potential of foreign companies to contribute to sustainable local-level development is the possibility of them withdrawing when investments no longer appear viable, as some oil majors did in January 2015. Government capacities need to evolve to address the heightened risks of environmental damage, societal vulnerability and the unpredictability of investment and revenues associated with extractive industry development. A particular challenge is the lack of meaningful public involvement in decision making and the risk that the ‘social licence to operate' of future energy projects will be determined by a few elected politicians. The role of civil society is critical to help tackle this challenge.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34
"The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the concept of sustainability has developed in the politico-economic context of Russia and in the Russian Arctic energy industry. This paper provides a substantial overview of sustainability priorities developed in Russia and then, based on state and media perspectives on Russian Arctic energy, it analyzes the critical directions of concept development in this context. The rhetoric of the sustainability concept in the country and in the context of Arctic energy may not necessarily develop in the same way. The priorities may focus on industrial technology and transport modernization, energy and environmental security, an emergency preparedness system and coordination, governance, international partnerships on Arctic governance and maritime issues, preventing pollution and waste, sustainable management, improving quality of life of indigenous people, and scientific research issues that are crucial for this context. The paper concludes that the politico-economic context itself has strongly influenced the development of the sustainability concept in Russia. Furthermore, based on the results of this study, it is suggested that, in a context of the Russian Arctic, legitimization is more dependent on the state position than on that of the media.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34
"In this paper we discuss the historical dimensions of energy in rural Alaska to argue that energy security in rural locations involves different considerations than in urban areas, and as such a definition of energy security needs to be downscaled to a place-based perspective, addressing individual and household needs as opposed to national issues of supply, consumption, and distribution. The definition of energy security for local communities that we propose is adapted from the food security literature: having sufficient access to energy generation or provisioning services to conduct a sustainable life. Also similar to the food security literature, the framework we propose includes four dimensions to energy security: availability, access, quality, and stability. This paper applies the proposed definition and framework to the example of rural Alaska. Alaska has an abundance of energy sources, from oil and gas to a host of renewables, however due to colonial legacies, lack of infrastructure, policies and social structure a number of communities in rural Alaska struggle with energy insecurity.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34
"This article explores the existing normative system’s regulation of relations between indigenous peoples of the North and industrial companies in Russia. Special attention is given to the issue of responsibility in Arctic development by government, by industrial companies (company policies), and by indigenous small-numbered peoples (customary law). For all those involved in nature management in the Russian North, the potential for overcoming the dangers they face depends on a combination of these normative frameworks. The study is based on legal anthropology methods, which combine ethnographic field research (including participant observation and expert interviews) and analysis of texts of national laws, regulations, internal corporate documents as well as traditional customs. It is grounded in principles of legal pluralism, which allows for the co-existence of multiple legal regimes governing interaction between indigenous people and industrial companies. The article concludes that what is required in the Russian North is full implementation of existing legislation and industrial companies’ social together with environmental commitments, plus an integrated approach that takes into account local legal, ethno-cultural and historical practices, in addition to assessment by ethnological experts in the field of legal anthropology.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34
"Trust in Norwegian-Russian energy relations is one in the making. Both sides have actively pursued policies to build trust, particularly over the past decade. The process has been driven by shared economic interests, the prominence of the petroleum industry in both countries, and a desire to improve political relations on both sides. Factors shaping trust are pre-existing on the one hand, and determined by the actors’ signals on the other. Different organisational and cultural preferences likewise play a role in the development of trust and degree of co-operation. While trust appears to have contributed to breakthroughs in co-operation such as the resolution of the maritime border and new joint ventures in oil exploration, a lack of trust owing to diverging interests and market forces is inhibiting collaboration in the realm of gas. This potentially puts Norway and Russia on a path to increased competition for their primary gas markets, first in Germany and then in the rest of continental Europe.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34
"The Arctic region is opening up due to climate change, causing sea ice extend and snow cover to decrease. Over the past decade economic activities, including fisheries, shipping, oil & gas, mining and tourism have increased throughout the region. Especially the oil and gas activities are subject to public debate and attract a lot of (international) attention. Obtaining and maintaining the support of local stakeholders are thus of major importance if governments and companies want to see these activities continue and contribute meaningfully to the resilience of Arctic societies. The concept of a Social License to Operate addresses the acceptance of an activity by local communities and other stakeholders. This manuscript explores the role human capital development in obtaining and maintaining a Social License to Operate in Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. As trust and legitimacy are the two fundamental principles on which a Social License to Operate is based, these are being examined more closely. On the basis of three case studies, this manuscript explores how human capital development can contribute to the legitimacy of Arctic energy development and trust building between various stakeholders.","Volume 16, Pages 1-160 (June 2016)",June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/16/suppl/C,34

However, the current trend toward development is not the first time that oil has been extracted from the Arctic.

The results suggest that we need to replace the current stakeholder-centred approach of energy policy, with one based upon justice.

Much of its resource trove is located under the region's disputed international waters. Working from a region-centered perspective, combining old and new geopolitical theories, we examine whether the Arctic's special characteristics make circumpolar state cooperation more or less likely in an economic and politically sustainable fashion. We systematically assess the correlation between economic and military activities by putting together descriptive spatial and temporal data on new oil and gas projects, shipping routes and activity, icebreaker orders, submissions to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS), and different types of military activities of the five Arctic littoral states. We find substantial evidence of increased Arctic investment and trade transit followed by militarization.

Despite significant reforms following past disasters, we estimate that, with 388 reactors in operation, there is a 50% chance that a Fukushima event (or more costly) occurs every 60–150 years. We also find that the average cost of events per year is around the cost of the construction of a new plant. This dire outlook necessitates post-Fukushima reforms that will truly minimize extreme nuclear power risks. Nuclear power accidents are decreasing in frequency, but increasing in severity.",Volume 15,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/15/suppl/C,35
"Renewable energy technologies, such as solar water heaters (SWHs) and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), have been widely adopted in China. Using an extended model of the Theory of Planned Behavior, we investigated how social–psychological factors (environmental attitudes, perceived behavioral control (PBC), subjective and descriptive norms, and renewable energy knowledge) affect individuals’ intention to adopt SWHs and AFVs and support renewable energy policies for a sample of 655 Chinese university students. Results of structural equation models indicate that environmental attitudes have strong positive effects on the intention to adopt SWHs and AFVs and support renewable energy policies. Renewable energy knowledge has a positive impact on these two dependent variables. In addition, subjective and descriptive norms and PBC positively influence the intention to adopt renewable energy technologies, but have no significant effect on support for renewable energy policies. Implications of the results are discussed.",Volume 15,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/15/suppl/C,35
"This paper analyses the role of behavioural factors for the energy management of MSEs in Sub-Sahara Africa for the first time. Drawing on semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions in Uganda, it finds that behavioural barriers impeding energy efficiency contribute to the limited performance of MSEs in Uganda. Limited self-control and short-term thinking, habits, a status quo bias and a lack of trust impede the uptake of energy efficiency, while first-hand experience with efficient technology, implementation intentions and social learning can be conducive. Behavioural insights on energy efficiency therefore present another piece of the puzzle on MSE performance.",Volume 15,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/15/suppl/C,35
"We tested whether the colour temperature of the illumination (realised through manipulating the ceiling light) impacted on thermal comfort, based on the hypothesis that a lower colour temperature is associated with feeling warmer and a higher colour temperature with feeling cooler. If confirmed, then light might be a tool for energy-saving through allowing ambient air temperatures to vary over a wider range and hence reducing the need for space heating and cooling.Testing took place in a climate chamber. In Study 1, comfort ratings were collected using thermal comfort surveys (N = 32). In Study 2, an observational design was used, where changes in clothing level, interpreted as thermal discomfort responses, were observed (N = 32). We compared comfort ratings and changes in clothing level under light with a colour temperature of 2700 K vs. 6500 K. Results partly confirmed the hypotheses: both self-report and observation indicated higher comfort under the low colour temperature. Further research will need to replicate findings in a real-world setting to see if light might indeed be a tool to modulate thermal comfort, and hence reduce usage of heating and cooling.",Volume 15,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/15/suppl/C,35
"The workplace offers opportunities for energy savings, but few studies have evaluated the effect of energy feedback in offices. This paper reports a case study of an energy visualisation intervention among social care staff. The research examined the role of feedback design (simple graphs vs. visualisation) and discusses the feasibility of implementing a near real-time visual feedback intervention into a work setting with staff keenly aware of their primary job roles. The findings show a staff sample with positive beliefs towards energy saving, but bounded by low feelings of self-efficacy, weak social norms, and perceived barriers in the office. Feedback may have supported feelings of collective efficacy and encouraged staff to talk with colleagues about ways to save energy. But engagement with feedback – and energy use in general – was limited. Energy use was embedded in other concerns and issues, such as a strong team culture and wider problems in the building. The case study highlights the complexities of energy-related behaviours in the workplace and the role visualising energy could play in this context. Engagement will be a key challenge in achieving successful feedback initiatives; we provide recommendations to tackle this challenge and identify areas for future research.",Volume 15,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/15/suppl/C,35
"The increase of energy efficiency is a major goal of many countries throughout the world. For the successful achievement, consumers must choose energy-efficient household appliances. The European Union (EU) has introduced an energy label for energy-related durables to empower consumers to make energy-friendly choices. Due to the great progress in energy efficiency and the ban of inefficient products on the market, only products in the top efficiency classes are available for many categories, while products in lower classes are no longer manufactured. However, the energy-efficiency scale on the label still displays a range of seven classes (e.g., A++–E). This paper presents a systematic analysis of the influence of the presentation format of energy-efficiency information on consumers’ assessments of products’ energy friendliness. A series of experimental studies reveals that the display of a rating scale that includes only the energy-efficiency classes of products still available in the market (i.e., a shorter scale) enhances consumers’ perceptions of the differences in energy friendliness between the classes. Consequently, the findings suggest that the format of the energy-efficiency scale significantly influences consumers’ perceptions of the energy-efficiency gains of products in higher efficiency classes, positively affecting their motivation to choose the most energy-efficient products.",Volume 15,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/15/suppl/C,35
"In 2012, the Low Income High Costs (LIHC) indicator was proposed as an alternative way of measuring fuel poverty (Hills, 2012) [27]. Since its publication, the indicator has received considerable attention, not only in Great Britain, but also in other European countries. The applicability of the indicator is, however, highly contingent on detailed household and building data. This leads to the question of whether it is feasible to use the indicator in countries with less extensive available data. In this study, we test the applicability of the LIHC indicator in France, using an innovative approach to estimate energy requirements in locations with limited availability of physical building data. We show how this enables us to conveniently adapt the two most frequently used indicators to the French context (and possibly to other countries) and how to compare their results.",Volume 15,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/15/suppl/C,35
"In this paper we present MELiSsa, a local multi-regional energy system model of a specific area: the Lombardy region. MELiSsa, implemented through an open-code modeling framework (OSeMOSYS), is built upon transparent relations and open data. Building this model is a first step towards four main goals: (i) extending the energy planning process of the region to citizens and experts usually not involved; (ii) exploiting this uncommon participation for a crowd-source development; (iii) providing a simple tool for interested local citizens to get consciousness of the technological and behavioral limits of their energy system; (iv) providing a real-case-based platform for interdisciplinary research and academic purposes possibly beyond the region boundaries. The current structure and input data of MELiSsa are presented and discussed together with a demonstrative analysis. Preliminary results show that interdisciplinary participation is enabled as an opportunity and it is needed to properly model technological dynamics as well as non-technological issues that will be relevant within the path to reach environmental, economic and social targets.",Volume 15,May 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/15/suppl/C,35
"Energy resources are transported long distances and create powerful interlinkages between countries. Energy thus contributes to the globalization of the world, but has received little attention in the globalization literature. This article hypothesizes that energy globalization is growing and accelerating. The hypothesis is tested by developing an index to measure changes in the extent of energy globalization during the 20-year period from 1992 to 2011. The following sub-indicators are included in the index: number of energy trade relationships, average distance of energy trade relationships, and energy dependency of the countries in the world. The development of the index encounters a number of conceptual and methodological challenges related to globalization, which, it turns out, have not been addressed properly in the broader literature. Clarification of these issues can help improve the analysis of globalization.",Volume 14,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/14/suppl/C,36
"Local factors influencing the rate of diffusion of residential photovoltaic (PV) systems are insufficiently understood. This multiple-case study explored five Swedish municipalities which have had a particularly high PV density in terms of number of installations per capita, compared to other municipalities. The aim was to identify and assess local factors that could explain these relatively high rates of PV diffusion. This was done through a survey sent to PV adopters in the five case municipalities, interviews with local actors and comprehensive Internet search queries. These five cases were also compared to fifty municipalities with low PV diffusion rates, which were studied in less depth. Peer effects (individuals influencing each other to adopt PV) and local organisations promoting PV were identified as important explanatory factors for the high local PV diffusion rates. In particular, electric utilities have successfully taken an active role in supporting PV, purchasing the surplus electricity of PV adopters, selling turnkey PV systems and disseminating information through seminars and their web pages.",Volume 14,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/14/suppl/C,36
"Achieving EU climate targets requires an immense volume of investments in renewable energies, especially in the field of wind energy. Private individuals can play an essential role in raising significant parts of the necessary financial resources. This requires, however, a thorough understanding of investors' preferences. Based on choice experiments by 725 German respondents who intend to invest in wind energy in the near future, this article shows that private individuals' investment decisions are not only made with profit maximization in mind. Furthermore, this study reveals that an individual's age, asset valuation and environmental attitude significantly affect the preference for different wind energy investment attributes. The findings of this study have important implications for financial institutions and for policy, as the findings indicate that private individuals are not well informed about many aspects of wind energy investments.",Volume 14,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/14/suppl/C,36
"Renewable energy production is climbing the public agenda in many countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA region), for reasons of energy security, independence and local value creation. While technical and economic barriers are largely understood, in this paper we investigate the issue of community acceptance. In so doing, we explore the importance of relevant drivers of community acceptance such as level of expected socio-economic and environmental impacts, procedural and distributive justice, and trust. We conducted 232 face-to-face interviews with the local population in Ouarzazate in Morocco, the building site of a flagship project for concentrated solar power in the MENA region. We find that community acceptance is almost universal, particularly because solar power is perceived to be environmentally friendly. At the same time perceived level of knowledge about the project is very low, which is positively linked to the high level of acceptance. Our data suggest that there may be some social desirability bias distorting community acceptance; only long-term experience with the project will show whether hopes for job creation will be fulfilled and high levels of acceptance can be maintained.",Volume 14,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/14/suppl/C,36
"In the context of urbanization and energy turnaround, local district heating (LDH) is one possibility to decentralize energy production and use environmentally friendly energy sources. When constructing an LDH network, planners have multiple possibilities concerning network design, security of supply, and choice of energy source. So far, little is known about users’ preferences concerning these factors, which might have considerable impact on the acceptance of alternative energy systems. A two-step approach was pursued to investigate LDH network design preferences: first, a focus group on LDH systems from the users’ perspective was run. Second, conjoint analysis was applied to analyze preferences for LDH characteristics (network design, security of supply, and type of energy source). Most relevant factors in the context of LDH systems were costs, source dependence, organizational issues, security of energy supply, environmental effects, and construction work. Results of the conjoint analysis showed that the energy source and its corresponding primary energy factor was the most important attribute for preferences, followed by network design. The preference for energy sources changed dramatically when introducing different prices for energy sources. Results further indicate that it is necessary to integrate users’ requirements into LDH network planning processes and to improve communication about LDH.",Volume 14,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/14/suppl/C,36
"Landscape impacts are commonly cited as barriers to new energy infrastructure, but rarely are perceptions of such impacts monitored over time. Built in the mid-1960s, the Mactaquac hydroelectric generating station in New Brunswick, Canada, is degrading, and its future is under review. We took locals on houseboats to learn how they felt about the dam, the landscape it altered, and the future of the facility. Using the concept of cultural imaginaries we observe important themes about how landscape changes are experienced, perceived and reinterpreted by local residents over time. Despite the initial trauma of construction, most residents expressed a deep sense of place, identity and appreciation of the headpond’s aesthetic and recreational value, as well as its renewable energy. Our methods revealed social pressures at play: collective discussions endorsed keeping the reservoir intact, whether or not energy continues to be produced, while individuals alone were more likely to appreciate the former river, with some participants privately open to its restoration. The establishment within a generation of connection to this site of energy production suggests the value of taking a long view to understanding landscape transitions, which cuts both ways, providing possible consolation to proponents of renewable and conventional energy alike.",Volume 14,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/14/suppl/C,36
"Because human interaction with buildings significantly influences the energy consumption of buildings, predicting this type of behavior has become increasingly important in recent years. Improvement of understanding provides a basis for improving the quality of behavior-predicting models and requires an adequate consideration of the context of human-building interactions. The relevant context must be thoroughly identified and organized, and the knowledge gleaned from this analysis can then be used to theoretically conceptualize the problem. It is a plausible assumption that models and theories from disciplines traditionally dealing with human behavior, namely psychology and sociology, are best suited to conceptualize energy-relevant human interactions with buildings. A method for the identification and organization of relevant context attributes and their interrelations was proposed in Ref. [1]. Based on the results presented there, this paper exemplifies the transition from this qualitative knowledge of context to the conceptualization of a problem-specific psychological theory that promotes a better understanding and predictability of energy-relevant interaction with buildings. The aspect chosen to illustrate this process, which is considerably developed in this paper, refers to the decision processes of the building occupant that occur prior to executing the interaction.",Volume 14,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/14/suppl/C,36
"This study examined the use of thermal imaging as a communication tool that allows householders to ‘see’ where a building is losing heat. We tested the effect of tailored and non-tailored thermal images on energy beliefs, behavioural intentions and a simple self-report behaviour question in an English field study. Householders received tailored thermal images of their home, thermal images of other homes with typical problems for the area (‘non-tailored’), or information on the same typical problems in text format. A post-intervention survey (N = 233) indicated that showing occupants any thermal image (tailored or non-tailored) led to higher vividness when recalling the communication, compared to text-only information. Householders engaged with the reports to a greater extent when they were personal to their home: the tailored thermal images were more likely to be shared with others and led to stronger energy saving intentions and reporting energy efficiency behaviour compared to non-tailored reports. This is a promising approach integrating technology and social science knowledge and methods.",Volume 14,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/14/suppl/C,36
"Recent rapid growth in the natural gas industry has led to concerns about the potential impacts of development on local communities, and the capacity of current governance arrangements to manage those impacts. Although a growing body of research explores the impacts of ‘boomtown’ mining and energy development in inland communities, comparatively little work has examined the impacts of natural gas development on communities in the coastal zone. Coastal communities are part of complex social-ecological systems that are increasingly a focal point for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) development. Drawing on in-depth interviews and grey literature, this paper examines the direct, indirect and cumulative social-ecological impacts of LNG development in a coastal community in Australia, an emerging hub for the global gas industry. The research finds that the impacts of coastal LNG development share similarities with conventional mining, but also present new challenges for the governance of the industry.",Volume 14,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/14/suppl/C,36
"The transition from conventional energy sources toward a sustainably renewable energy-based system is being discussed in many parts of the world, on regional and larger levels. This article aims to broaden the understanding of regional transition processes by exploring the case of Marin County in the United States. The article expands on the heuristic Three-Phase-Model of regional transition (3PM), which was grounded on three case studies in Germany. As such, we compare the Marin County case with the original three cases. We present results on how the transition toward a local, renewable energy-based system emerged and developed in Marin County. Using the 3PM as a guideline, we also explore the differences and similarities to transition processes in the German cases. Although the wider institutional context is very different from Germany, the overall regional transition process in California was very similar in regards to the specific type and role of actors, their activities, the role of motives and artifacts. What differed most was that conflicts influencing process dynamics were much more evident in Marin County, especially the conflict with the incumbent utility and the conflict over localization of renewable energy production. We suggest adapting the 3PM according to these findings.",Volume 14,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/14/suppl/C,36
"This article provides an historical analysis of arguments for and against using forests for fuel since the 1970s energy crises, and explores the relationship between public narratives and the implementation of renewable energy technologies. I argue that different ideas about the use of forest resources created narrative conflict between stakeholder groups, and this conflict influenced the development of biomass energy systems by limiting private investment and shaping public policy. Promoters and opponents of forest fuels both worked to achieve political goals as well as economic and environmental ones, and debates about biomass energy reflected these different views. Although this paper focuses on public perceptions about wood energy in the US, biomass advocacy in the US was influenced by efforts in other countries, particularly by innovation in Sweden and Finland. By providing an historical investigation of the cultural barriers to developing decentralized renewable energy systems in the US, and explaining how this experience compared with biomass development in other countries, this research demonstrates how conflicting narratives have shaped energy and environmental policy since the 1970s. This historical perspective contains valuable lessons about how different social groups’ values and beliefs have affected – and continue to affect – decisions about new energy technologies.",Volume 14,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/14/suppl/C,36
"This paper analyses how co-benefits have been conceptualized by experts and practitioners in household energy technology carbon offset projects. Offset projects, where emissions in one place are compensated through reducing emissions elsewhere, are justified on the basis of providing local development co-benefits in addition to global emissions reductions. What constitutes a co-benefit, who is entitled to it and what range of issues co-benefits address has received little attention. Three types of household energy technologies that have been popular in voluntary carbon markets are analyzed: improved cookstoves, biogas digesters and ceramic water purifiers. The co-benefits of these technologies are conceptualized by experts and practitioners through three different storylines: achieving health benefits, challenging carbon credit ownership and creating sustainable local markets. While the first and last storylines have been dominant, they also contain a tension over supporting local production of the technologies in developing countries versus importing more efficient technologies. The storyline of carbon credit ownership is more marginal. Opening up the different storylines of co-benefits demonstrates that behind offset projects lie different motivations and interests. How the co-benefits of household energy technologies are conceptualized influences what type of projects are successful in voluntary carbon markets and how voluntary offsets are governed.",Volume 14,April 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/14/suppl/C,36
"Far from being a univocal process, energy transitions involve several pathways and require research that connects multiple theoretical, disciplinary and methodological perspectives. The European scenario is a clear example of how the boundaries and the direction of such process are difficultly identifiable and merged with culturally situated meanings and practices. In this opening paper, drawing on a psychosocial background, we propose a cultural approach as an attempt to overcome the dichotomies between technical and human, social and individual accounts of energy transitions. In this framework, we illustrate the two main axes that guided this collection of research: a situated perspective, and a focus on different planes of transition (individual, community, societal). Then, we present the European scenario and introduce the contributions, which propose a large variety of epistemological perspectives, and theoretical, methodological and disciplinary integrations. We conclude with a commentary of the main challenges to be addressed in order to develop a shared scientific paradigm: the need for further integration towards shared interpretative frameworks, the quest for a constructive and future-oriented research attitude, the importance of connecting different planes of analysis to foresee alternative scenarios, and the need for proposals and solutions to be addressed to decision makers.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37

"Due to the rapid growth of the domestic photovoltaic (PV) sector in the UK all involved are at an early learning stage in terms of implementation. Investors typically rely on national standards and guidance when developing specifications that define PV system components. However, PV technology performance is promoted and reported solely in terms of cost and energy efficiency goals, without holistic consideration of other contributing factors such occupants’ ability to effectively manage PV systems to reduce the peak demand issue linked with PV systems in the UK. This paper examines policy, design, installation, handover and use of domestic PV systems. An in-depth case study of 20 households in a new-build UK development demonstrates the challenges related to introducing PV systems in housing. Key findings identify the need for complete rather than partial design team involvement and capacity building for inexperienced residents as well as building industry actors. PV systems are perceived by policy makers and industry as requiring very limited occupant interaction with limited potential to impact on energy use practices—thus an integrated PV system learning process incorporating occupant feedback is disregarded. Poor individual occupant learning support and PV system feedback onsite makes this learning difficult.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"This study analyses the development of domestic customers’ energy-related performances and understandings during the transition from centralized, monopolist electricity provision to a liberal market in Estonia in 2012–2013. Liberalization brought about not only a new institutional and legal framework for electricity purchases, but also a significant price rise. The study proceeds from the assumption that these structural changes catalyzed shifts in the electricity-related practices of consumers and citizens. Theoretically, the analysis builds on practice theory and positioning analysis. We investigated how domestic electricity purchasing and consumption were positioned in media texts and consumers’ self-positionings vis-à-vis media discourse, including their resistance to what was interpreted as acceptable conduct. To code media texts, diaries and interviews, we employed the concept of performance positioning. The results reveal that learning the new social practice of purchasing electricity as a service made electricity more salient and visible, both as an object of consumption and as an object of media-inspired public discussion and critique, encouraging a search for new solutions, such as collective mobilization to bargain with suppliers. The paper’s further contribution lies in discussing the issue of a supportive communicative environment in the development of citizen-consumer self-positionings conducive to socially innovative forms of energy governance and usage.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"Large organizations are responsible for a significant amount of GHG emissions. This trend will even increase over the next 100 years. An issue for environmental research is the investigation of the factors promoting or hindering the transition to more sustainable energy behaviors in the workplace. This study is part of a larger project, funded under the EU-FP7 program, called “Low Carbon at Work” (LOCAW). We present the results of a qualitative study assessing the existing everyday behaviors in two large-scale organizations: an Italian-based multinational renewable energy producer, and a Spanish public university (The University of A Coruña). Data obtained by interviews with key-informers and focus groups were content analyzed, using ATLAS.ti. Results indicate many commonalities and some differences between the two case studies. Working in a green anergy company leads individuals to be more sensitized about environmental issues, although a core thematic category refers to the concept that energy-related behaviors “rely on individual feeling”. Data from the University of A Coruña suggest this organization has the right values and objectives, but it does not always adequately implement organizational policies to support sustainable energy use among students and employees.

"Citizen participation can be an important means for energy transitions at the local level. However, little is known about citizens’ willingness to engage in community-based renewable energy projects, and its determinants. This paper analyzes how community identity, social norms, trust and environmental concern foster or constrain citizens’ willingness to take part in community energy schemes. We survey individuals who are in charge of energy-related and financial decisions in their households, and owners of renewable energy systems. We find that the general attitude toward community energy is positive. Willingness to volunteer is higher than willingness to invest money. Regression analyses show that social norms, trust, environmental concern and community identity are important determinants of willingness to participate in community energy. However, using mediation analyses we find that the effect of community identity occurs through changes in social norms and trust. Both ownership of a renewable energy system and living in a rural, rather than urban community, increase the likelihood of participation. This study helps to understand the principles underpinning the willingness to participate in community energy and underlines its potential. Our insights emphasize the importance of social, rather than merely environmentally motivated aspects, and extend literature on pro-environmental behavior.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"Distributed generation is becoming increasingly important in energy systems, causing a transition towards decentralisation. These decentralisation dynamics are difficult to predict in their scope and timing and therefore present a major challenge for utility companies. This paper aims to make a contribution to the field of energy transitions with a model-based theory-building approach. A conceptual framework of the major (circular) causalities of regional energy systems is presented. It improves the knowledge on transition patterns of distributed generation concepts and the interplaying network effects. Network effects between technologies, the installed base and the investment decision criteria are important elements in the transition dynamics. A System Dynamics simulation model is built, capturing the consumption concepts related to distributed generation, as well as arising network effects, to analyse the likely transition patterns of regional energy systems. Our simulation results highlight the significance of network effects steering the investment decision for distributed generation concepts, pilot projects to accelerate the transition of regional energy systems and the general role of microgrids in the decentralisation dynamics.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37

Three main dimensions of community perceptions of the impact, both positive and negative, of renewables are addressed: environmental, landscape and socioeconomic. The article is based on case studies of communities living in the vicinities of three wind farms and a solar power plant. The results show that not only community perceptions are heterogeneous but also that, in order to better understand the factors for social acceptance, it is crucial to examine perceptions not just at the planning stage but also once the energy infrastructures are constructed and functioning.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"The transformation from the current energy system to a decentralized renewable energy system requires the transformation of communities into energy neutral or even energy producing communities. Increasingly, citizens become ‘prosumers’ and pool their resources to start a local energy initiative. In this paper we present an in-depth study of networks that recently developed, which challenge the established way of centralized decision-making on energy resources.Many local communities are eager to promote sustainable energy production, to use local financial resources for the local community and to employ democratic governance of energy production and supply. Furthermore, we study how these co-operations are linked to local, regional and national networks for community energy.We use both Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and Social Movement Theory (SMT) to investigate the initiatives, as this allows a dynamic analysis of collective strategies.We discuss the obduracy of the energy system and how this system is challenged by new connections between communities and global networks and by new types of energy providers that are rooted in social networks. Furthermore, we draw attention to the way community energy networks provide a social innovation while realizing a decentralized and decarbonized energy system.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"This paper analyses how citizens (re)define their relation to the state in the contestation of hydraulic fracturing in the Noordoostpolder (the Netherlands) in the context of energy transition. It approaches citizenship as the negotiations between governments and citizens about in-and exclusion in decision-making processes and argues that these are also produced at the site of energy transition. It focuses on how residents of the Noordoostpolder construct their citizenship, resisting the advent of fracking in their environment while at the same time negotiating their own inclusion in decision-making processes. Our ethnographic material encompasses almost a year of these negotiations starting shortly after the announcement of the Noordoostpolder as a site for exploratory drilling, when people feel highly disempowered and excluded. We closely follow a process of gradual empowerment in the face of energy transition as inhabitants start to produce their own knowledge base and coalesce into unusual partnerships to negotiate their inclusion. Our main argument is that negotiations about hydraulic fracturing in relation to energy transition goes beyond energy issues. It is also -if not mostly -about who gets to decide on energy and land use.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"This paper examines the implications posed by the European Climate Protection Plan and the German Energy Transition. Both involve social conflicts regarding technical feasibility, norms, and values. Technological expertise alone is insufficient to resolve these normative questions and conflicts. In addition to technological expertise, social and communicative competence is therefore needed to deal with the social and cultural challenges of an energy transition. One method to cope with conflicts that arise as a result of the energy transition refers to the use of citizen participation. Many analysts of participatory processes suggest that participation, if done properly, enhances acceptability and legitimacy of a transition process, contributes to improved efficiency of decisions, and promotes factual knowledge. This paper analyses and discusses these anticipated positive effects within a theoretical framework and a corresponding empirical case study.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"This paper looks at citizen power plants in Austria – wind farms and photovoltaics plants jointly owned and operated by groups of citizens – and asks whether their establishment can be interpreted as a process of empowerment. To this end I draw on resource-based notions of power, understanding empowerment as the increase of disadvantaged actors’ ability to mobilize and use resources for their goals. I argue that the establishment of citizen power plants constitutes a process of successive resource mobilization in which bottom-up actors have been able to access an increasing amount of resources. At first sight this suggests that the establishment of citizen power plants in Austria indeed constitutes a process of empowerment. However, I also discuss three qualifications to such an interpretation. Firstly, the modulation of ends to which resources are put (assimilation and incorporation to established structures); secondly, the persistence of dependency relations for resource access; and thirdly, a bias of citizen power plant initiatives toward already better-resourced individuals and communities.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"The dominant model of energy infrastructure has historically been conceived in a very centralized fashion, i.e., with hardly any citizen involvement in energy generation. Yet, increasing attention is being paid to the transition process towards a more decentralized configuration. This article examines the factors likely to foster citizen and community participation as regards wind power cooperatives in Denmark, Germany, Belgium and the UK. Using Elinor Ostrom’s Social-Ecological System Framework, the analysis highlights a double-edged phenomenon: prevailing and growing hostility toward cooperatives, on the one hand, and, on the other, strategic reactions to this evolution. What comes out indeed is that, throughout most of these countries, the emergence of some coordinated inter-organizational actions among cooperatives enables them to survive in their critical environment.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"The paper analyzes the role of civil society in Italy’s energy transition with particular attention paid to those forms of social innovation developing new energy pathways alternative to the dominant ones. The international literature emphasizes the weakness of such initiatives in southern Europe as compared to Northern European countries. However, there is a lack of analysis of empirical cases in this area, as well as convincing explanations for the lagging behind of Southern European countries.Against this background, on the basis of qualitative research centered on semi-structured interviews with civil society actors, we analyze the main grassroots initiatives emerging in Italy in regard to the production, consumption, and recently the provision, of renewable energy. In the discussion part of the paper, we explore these innovative practices with a comparative approach taking Germany as the main reference point. Hence we explain the fragility of Italian experience in relation to structural socio-economic characteristics of the country – namely municipal socialism and dualism of the capitalist system – and to the evolution of the Italian cooperative movement. Eventually we also assess the potential of emerging initiatives for challenging the existing centralized energy system.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"In this article we assess public communication on nuclear energy in Poland against four theoretical ideal types of the public sphere in modern democracies. We investigate law, media discourse, and civil society as dimensions of the public sphere, and use the analysis to draw out broader implications for energy transitions. We conclude that although in the legal and civil society realms there are some elements of the participatory liberal type, the current functioning of the public sphere is rather aligned with the representative liberal democracy type and does not further energy transition. The representative liberal type is supported by mainstream media, focused mainly on economic and political elites. This is why initiatives of grassroots movements are not reflected in public discourse, neither in traditional media nor on the Internet. Even if they appear, their impact is limited because of weak exposition. Our research offers reflections on how energy transition may be furthered via the public sphere. The article brings a sociological and socio-legal analysis of the public sphere to energy policy research. By presenting the unique case of potential new nuclear power plant build in Poland, we contribute an integrative view of energy policy as a public governance issue in contemporary Central and East European democracies.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"This article examines how members of the Swedish Parliament framed nuclear energy in the 2010 debate on the future of nuclear power in Sweden in order to understand how politicians construct and contextualize their views on the role of nuclear energy in energy transitions. Our findings suggest that four themes could be identified in the debate and that these were formative for politicians in framing nuclear energy. Even though all political actors anticipate an energy transition towards a more sustainable system, different paths to advancing in this process were brought up in the debate, both with and without prolongation of the nuclear energy program. Our analysis suggests that framings of nuclear energy are closely related to the political ideologies of the parties in the Parliament because the two framings of nuclear energy correspond with the division of the Swedish Parliament into two political blocs. However, views on nuclear energy are not inherent to political ideologies but are constructed. This article thus integrates the politics of nuclear energy within the research on energy transitions.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"This paper uses a socio-technical approach to explore why the transition towards modern bioenergy has achieved success in some segments and/or countries but not in others. We reflect on the availability of initial socio-technical resources in the form of established platforms, policy motivations, and the roles of different stakeholders. We analyse how socio-technical networks evolved over time in response to enabling policies and interest groups as well as opposition groups in four different bioenergy segments: solid biomass for district heating in Sweden, charcoal for iron and steel industry in Brazil, and ethanol for transport in both countries. The Swedish and Brazilian experiences illustrate the importance of coordinating policies between local and national levels and across sectors in order to advance modern bioenergy platforms. The focus on Sweden—an EU and global bioenergy pioneer—along with Brazil—a recognised global biofuels leader—helps to illustrate the linkages to regional and global markets that are important for European energy transitions. The analysis also emphasizes the need to look beyond the energy sector, considering actors and stakeholders' interests at large, as well as broad boundaries for socio-technical regimes. Our analysis draws on the established literature concerning socio-technical transitions, innovation systems and systems approaches.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37

"Transitioning away from our current global energy system is of paramount importance. The speed at which a transition can take place—its timing, or temporal dynamics—is a critical element of consideration. This study therefore investigates the issue of time in global and national energy transitions by asking: What does the mainstream academic literature suggest about the time scale of energy transitions? Additionally, what does some of the more recent empirical data related to transitions say, or challenge, about conventional views? In answering these questions, the article presents a “mainstream” view of energy transitions as long, protracted affairs, often taking decades to centuries to occur. However, the article then offers some empirical evidence that the predominant view of timing may not always be supported by the evidence. With this in mind, the final part of the article argues for more transparent conceptions and definitions of energy transitions, and it asks for analysis that recognizes the causal complexity underlying them.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"The low-carbon energy transition is a form of socio-technical transition and, as such, it involves profound changes in the institutions that govern society. Despite the acknowledged importance of institutions in shaping the pace and nature of transition, a relatively small proportion of the academic literature on the topic applies institutional theory to the analysis of this transition in a systematic and detailed manner, and these accounts draw mainly on organizational and sociological institutionalism. This paper aims to demonstrate the benefits of applying a wider set of institutional theories to the study of the low-carbon energy transition. It draws principally, but not solely, on rational choice and historical institutionalism with selective reference being made to key concepts within social and organizational institutionalism as well as discursive institutionalism. The paper demonstrates the high degree of parallelism that exists between the literatures on socio-technical regimes and institutions, and also shows how the systematic application of institutionalism can provide a deeper understanding of socio-technical transitions. It concludes by outlining the main elements of a research agenda relating to the low-carbon energy transition.","Volume 13, Pages 1-226 (March 2016)",March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/13/suppl/C,37
"Most of the energy related studies do often fall into a trap of resource-determinism, which turns the arguments around a primary importance of energy resources. The present commentary attempts to highlight major shortcomings of the resource-determinism and aims to conversely argue for a necessary social dimension in the resource–society interactions. Four critical points are then raised about resource-curse, energy dependencies, consumer–producer juxtaposition and about resource market interrelation. The comment draws an attention to the ontological debate in social sciences and to societal embeddedness of economic processes. On these grounds, the comment suggests to consider a resource as a dependent variable in international energy relations analysis.",Volume 12,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/12/suppl/C,38
"Among the climate economics models widely used in policy analysis, FUND is unique in several respects, including its disaggregated, modular treatment of damages and its relatively low estimates of damages and the social cost of carbon (SCC). We present two possible reasons for FUND’s low damage estimates: the representation of carbon fertilization in agriculture; and assumptions about the extent of adaptation.We explore these issues in FUND 3.8, comparing the model’s default results to scenarios without carbon fertilization and adaptation. We find that carbon fertilization is projected to provide a large net benefit, offsetting many of the damages in other categories; almost half of this benefit occurs in China, based on FUND’s assumptions about the regional strength of carbon fertilization. Automatic adaptation, tied to increases in per capita income, reduces many damages, particularly deaths caused by climate change; almost three-fourths of the reduction in climate-linked deaths is projected to occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, many categories of damages are surprisingly small, a topic that warrants further research. As long as FUND’s default forecasts remain significant in climate policy debate, it is important to understand the sources of FUND’s low estimates of climate damages.",Volume 12,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/12/suppl/C,38
"The smart grid has been hailed for its potential to address a wide range of problems with current electricity infrastructure, with improvements expected in consumer awareness of energy use, energy efficiency, renewable energy distribution, and reliability of service. Some estimates suggest that the smart grid could reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by more than 2%. However, a vocal minority has expressed concerns about the health, privacy, and cost impacts of the smart grid. Here we use a convenience sample of online respondents to quantitatively examine the American lay public's level of knowledge about smart meters and the smart grid and show that a majority of respondents are wholly unfamiliar with smart energy technology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to information-deficit model expectations, knowledge of and exposure to smart meters do not necessarily lead to acceptance. On the contrary, knowledge and exposure is associated with increased concerns about negative impacts of these technologies. Implications for smart grid policy interventions are discussed.",Volume 12,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/12/suppl/C,38
"Much has been achieved over the last decade to highlight the need for energy research to look beyond the technical dimensions of energy systems to include the social elements of energy consumption and production. Inter-disciplinary research in this area has thus been growing. The degree of penetration by the social sciences into technical energy analysis, however, has largely been weak not just within academic research but also in policy and decision-making. This paper introduces Actor-Network Theory (ANT) as a frame and mode of thinking about inter-disciplinary energy research in practice. In presenting a short history of its classical status, evolution and more contemporary applications, this paper highlights the concepts of social-material heterogeneity, enrolment, enactment and translation and some applications to energy research. It argues that an ANT approach: (1) expands the purview of analysis to the larger web of people and things that co-constitute energy systems; (2) gives visibility to previously inconspicuous actors and processes; (3) actively engages with ignorance and uncertainty in scientific experimentation; and (4) identifies alternative ways of assembling technologies, people and environments that are fairer and more sustainable.",Volume 12,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/12/suppl/C,38
"Thermal building simulations serve to optimize the energy consumption of a building during its design phase. Because modern building design offers occupants increasing opportunities to interact with the building in order to adjust internal conditions according to their individual needs, the prediction of these interactions needs to be included in optimization calculations. The way to an adequate consideration of human interaction in building simulations requires that two questions be addressed: First, which contextual factors are impactful to this process, and how are they related to each other? Second, which methods are best suited to predicting energy-relevant interaction based on the knowledge of these contextual factors? This article addresses the first question through the development of a data acquisition and analysis method. The technique is based on “protocol analysis,” which is a method originally developed to generate knowledge about the cognitive processes of humans during task implementation. The proposed method is applied in a pilot-study, which produced valuable, qualitative insights into the nature of the interaction and its relation to context. The results serve to address the second question in that they point to psychological theories that may prove significant for the future conceptualization of a cognitive theory of energy-relevant interaction.",Volume 12,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/12/suppl/C,38
"This paper examines the relations between financing institutions and more local ownership structures for energy provision. This research defines municipal and civil society structures involved in energy provision as the ‘Civic Energy Sector’. It argues that the financial institutions of nations are key enabling institutions for this sector to contribute to a low carbon energy transition. The path of development of these financial institutions helps to shape the ownership structures and technology choices of energy systems and futures in different nations. This paper presents findings from case analysis comparing the United Kingdom’s latent civic energy sector, with the expansion of this sector in Germany. Using an institutional economics framing, the paper demonstrates the importance of the German local banking sector in facilitating civic ownership structures in that country. In contrast, the neo-liberal, market-led financial institutions in the UK, reinforce energy pathways less reliant on civic ownership models. Hence, the forms of low carbon energy transition being pursued in these countries are constrained by path dependence of institutions both within and beyond the energy sector.",Volume 12,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/12/suppl/C,38
"Several scholars studying energy relations between Europe and Russia have grappled with the question of why such fragmented governance architecture has emerged between these two actors. While this question seems obsolete in the context of the current EU–Russian political impasse, it is, at the very least, odd that despite the standoff, plans for the South Stream pipeline have until recently proceeded almost apace.1 How has this been possible? It is now widely, albeit reluctantly, accepted that Europe depends on Russia's gas and that Russia, in its turn, cannot do without the lucrative EU market. While this reality is basically indisputable, at the macro level this energy trade relationship has been marked with controversies since the breakup of the Soviet Union.Despite the frostiness at what I will call the macro-level, in the past decade, individual EU states and the Kremlin have signed a handful of IGAs for joint pipeline development. Even more importantly, EU companies have concluded a number of important deals with Gazprom: pipelines have been built together, asset swaps concluded, and joint ventures implemented. All this has occurred against the background of increasingly tense relations at the macro level. Therefore, the biggest dilemma when looking into the black box of the EU-Russia gas relationship is how we might make sense of such a vast, multi-faceted, and yet deeply fraught relationship, occurring at so many different levels with varying actors. This article considers a number of political explanations for gas policy and shows that it is usually the economic interests of big energy firms that frequently take precedence, although these are often ignored and hidden as factors.",Volume 12,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/12/suppl/C,38
"This paper offers a new, interdisciplinary framework for the analysis of governing for sustainable energy system change by drawing together insights from, and offering critiques of, socio-technical transitions and new institutionalist concepts of change. Institutions of all kinds, including rules and norms within political and energy systems, tend to have path-dependent qualities that make them difficult to change, whereas we also know that profound change has occurred in the past. Current decisions to pursue climate change mitigation by dramatically changing how energy is produced and used depend to some extent on finding the right enabling conditions for such change. The approach adopted here reveals the highly political and contingent nature of attempts to govern for innovations, how political institutions mediate differently between forces for sustainable change and forces for continuity, as well as specific interactions between governance and practice change within energy systems. It concludes that it is only by being specific about the contingent nature of governing for innovations, and about how this affects practices in energy systems differently, that those of us interested in sustainability can credibly advise policy makers and drive for greater change.",Volume 12,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/12/suppl/C,38
"Although the expansion of new renewable energy has been dependent on support in state policies, the research literature has scant focus on the political motivations for implementing policies to stimulate such development. The growth of wind power is an illustrative case of renewables expansion, as this is the most mature of the new renewable technologies. What can explain the rapid development of wind power production capacity in the EU and in China, despite their very different political systems and basic preconditions? Applying the method of most-different systems design in combination with document studies and interviewing, this article demonstrates how large-scale investments in wind power have come about through a specific set of political motivations backed by strong governmental support policies with similar main aims: security of energy supply, creating future-oriented industries and employment, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions and local pollution. These three factors together, broadly perceived, might also explain the political motivations that drive large investment in new renewable energy sources elsewhere.1",Volume 12,February 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/12/suppl/C,38
"Techno-scientific imaginaries implicitly frame policy agendas that protect and motivate new technologies. In this paper we focus on how smart grids (SG) are portrayed in European policies and through social actors’ discourses, as well as, what their significance for citizens is claimed to be. Drawn upon the concept of socio-technical imaginaries we explore the discourses of social actors regarding the implementation of SG in the European Union, from policy makers, industry and consumer perspectives. In order to do so, we use knowledge assessment, a qualitative approach that looks into the pedigree of the knowledge input in policy processes and its quality in terms of fitness for purpose and function. Through the analysis of EU policy documents related to SG and interviews conducted with relevant social actors, we looked at the official visions about SG coming from the policy sphere, the main supporters of the SG vision and proposal. We looked into discourses, factual or imaginary argumentation and justifications, promises, motivations, appeals to the public and other narrative elements that scaffold the SG vision in Europe.

"The International Energy Charter, signed by 64 states in May 2015, is analysed here against the structure of the existing formal institutions of international energy governance as outlined in the literature. In terms of actors, the Charter has a Europe/Eurasia centred nucleus of signatory states accompanied by the United States, China and some further ‘regional ambassador countries’ in Africa, Asia and Latin America. However, references to non-state actors are scant. In terms of the dimensions of energy policy, the Charter is relatively comprehensive, pertaining to all main sources of energy, addressing the modernisation of infrastructure and technology; stressing non-discriminatory ownership and taxation of resources, likewise facilitation of energy trade and investment; while remaining a non-binding political framework retaining sovereignty over resources; and omitting climate change issues from its references to market-based measures in environmental protection. The Charter remains instrumental to protect the market interests of large energy consumers and represents at best incremental progress vis-à-vis linking the interests of producers, transit states and consumer states.

"A sizable literature has begun to emerge on individual energy behavior, but research on energy behavior in business organizations has been far more limited, despite businesses' responsibility for a far larger fraction of energy use, global warming and other impacts. This article reviews studies of energy behavior in businesses, and suggests areas for additional social science research. We conducted a systematic review of bibliographies on energy and behavior, papers presented at recent conferences on behavior and energy, and reference lists of publications thus identified, and keyword searches on energy behavior and business and related topics. From these sources we identified research articles addressing energy behavior in businesses, and categorized them by qualitative content analysis into three levels of analysis: individuals within organizations, organizations, and institutional forces influencing organizations' behavior. Using this method, we found several well-developed research areas but also significant gaps on other important topics. Under-developed topics include factors influencing businesses' adoption of renewable energy; sector-specific studies on barriers to energy innovation; integrated studies of influences on businesses' energy behavior at the individual, organizational and institutional levels; and cross- cultural comparisons.

"Whether or not there will be a ""renaissance"" of nuclear power in the near future may depend upon the nature of support for this energy source among citizens and elected officials. Continued examination of the predictors of opposition to nuclear power therefore remains quite policy relevant. While the existing literature finds modest but consistent gender differences in attitudes towards nuclear power in the general publics of several Western countries, the robustness of this relationship has seldom been investigated across time or among elected officials. This paper addresses both of these gaps. First, analyzing nationally representative data from the Swedish general public between 1986 and 2011, we confirm that the theoretically expected gender divide in opposition to nuclear power—whereby women report greater opposition than do men—is indeed robust over time. Second, examining data from three recent surveys of elected officials at the local, regional, and national levels in Sweden, we find that female elected officials at each polity level report greater opposition to nuclear power than their male counterparts. Our results are consistent with the health and safety concerns argument, whereby women are less supportive than are men of technologies with considerable perceived health and safety risks.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"There is sufficient space in the United States to site large-scale renewable energy technologies, yet siting decisions are often highly contentious with conflicting land-use values. This paper examines conflicts surrounding large-scale solar power siting through the lens of place-making and the co-shaping of place and technology. It traces the place-based conflicts over the Ivanpah solar power plant in California over five years, from designed to operational, in order to understand the evolving public engagement process in issues of place. Place-making can aid in understanding conflicts over renewable energy siting by interpreting stakeholder values. Through the place-making process, both the place and technology were shaped but could only be bent so far until they became something else entirely, making the negotiation of trade-offs difficult and the object of the negotiation a moving target. Moving forward, the challenge should be addressed that the technology and place must be sufficiently concrete to engage the public in siting decisions but accomplished early enough to avoid polarization and to facilitate mutual accommodation. Innovative forms of place-based participation are needed that would help citizens to debate the properties and trade-offs of energy systems in constructive ways downstream without damaging or breaking trust.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"Attitudes towards wind energy development are influenced by a number of social, political, and geographic factors. Initial resident expectations for a development, and then the degree to which these expectations were later met can help explain support or opposition for wind energy. Yet, the role of met or unmet expectations is not well researched in explaining perceptions of and attitudes towards wind energy development. This study explores the relationship between met and unmet expectations and resident attitudes towards wind energy, as well as perceptions of wind turbine beauty, for rural residents near two wind energy projects in the U.S. state of South Dakota (SD). A survey (n = 239) administered in 2014 across two counties investigates the process of attitude and expectation formation towards the projects as they developed. Results show that the majority of residents had positive expectations, and these expectations are largely unmet; nonetheless, most residents retain positive attitudes towards both projects, although certain types of expectations are related to more positive or more negative attitudes. Furthermore, the survey results show that residents find turbines in motion to be more beautiful than static turbines—demonstrating the role of economic and environmental values in influencing wind energy attitudes and expectations.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"In order to reduce CO2 emissions in line with UK policy, existing UK homes need to be retrofitted to high thermal standards. A large proportion of these homes have traditional or aesthetically pleasing features which people are reluctant to compromise for the sake of thermal efficiency. A minority of such dwellings are protected by statute, but millions are not. There is a dearth of structured discussion on the issues owners of such homes face when planning thermal retrofits. This study begins with a literature review of sustainable development, heritage and aesthetics. It then reports the results of qualitative interviews with retrofitting owners of such homes in Cambridge, UK. It finds homeowners struggling to balance thermal issues against a range of heritage and aesthetic concerns which often overlap or clash. Homeowners develop their own logic in working these through, and their aesthetic convictions strongly influence what happens with retrofitting. The interviews suggest that concern for the heritage embodied in the housing stock can be one reason current policy does not always engage homeowners in retrofitting.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"The role of households in relation to heat and energy consumption has been well-described in both quantitative and qualitative studies. However, where practice theory has developed as the main theoretical framework within qualitative studies on energy consumption, the more recent quantitative studies do not interpret the results within a sociological theoretical context. Consequently, the two approaches are not contributing their respective insights on how to understand energy consumption.In this paper, the methodology of the quantitative studies is combined with the theoretical perspectives of the qualitative studies, emphasising how energy consumption is a result of energy-consuming practices. Focusing on heat consumption used for space heating and heating of water in single-family detached houses in Denmark, it is found that sociocultural differences between households such as income, education, occupation, and immigration status influence the amount of heat consumed by a household; directly as an indicator of household practices and indirectly through type of building and household characteristics. New interpretations based on theories of practice show that factors such as the social structure of heat consumption, status of houses and unreflective practices are important for understanding the role of households in relation to heat consumption, and for forming policies for sustainable development.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"Energy saving in commercial office buildings is often frustrated by the complex organisational nature of the communities with a stake in building energy performance. While policy support and landlords’ sustainability aspirations can give impetus towards energy saving, most consumption and savings potential is in the hands of the tenant firms. Relevant research is often framed in terms of barriers and drivers of energy saving, where reasons for lack of saving are explored. This study takes an alternative approach. It offers two case studies of central London office buildings owned by different firms with large international building fleets, both of whom have a core business commitment to sustainability and are reporting significant energy savings in these buildings. Using qualitative interviews with the top–down agents who are charged with making savings happen, the study explores the reasons savings are being made despite the kinds of barriers found more generally. It finds sustainability agendas are being driven by highly motivated agents, skilled in the art of persuasion, with strong personal relationship skills, an indefatigable positive attitude, and the flexibility to change strategies where needed. The metaphor of ‘selling energy savings’ is coined to frame this approach.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"Examining renovation processes having reduced energy consumption as an explicit goal, this article considers how energy efficiency is made part of renovation processes, focusing on the planning and design phase. Interviews and participant observations of meetings have been conducted. Applying a framework developed in practice theory, we demonstrate the importance of understanding routines, technology, meanings, and knowledge in order to understand why renovation processes repeat themselves and why a renovation practice are hard to change.The analysis shows that the professionals were only engaged in decisions in relation to their own specialized areas, which benefited established solutions. The existing technical infrastructure, such as the HVAC shafts and the district heating system, largely determined what issues were up for discussion. It was clear that practical know-how were valued much higher than theoretical knowledge. The meaning of an energy efficient renovations for the professionals was to reduce the energy consumed as much as possible in every renovated building. With this in mind, we were surprised by how little energy efficiency was on the agenda. We can conclude that there was nothing in the studied processes that could trigger changes and dislodge the inertia of the practice.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"In the domain of electricity saving in households, a multitude of informational offers is readily available. However, these are commonly either not very well tailored to the actual living situation of consumers, i.e. do not take into account which tips are in particular relevant for a household or require consumers to answer multiple, detailed and therefore time-consuming questions. Hence, a method for tailoring information to groups of households by analysing the structure of electricity saving potentials was tested in a large sample in Germany. Here, substantial saving potentials were found. Utilising the assessed relevance of different electricity saving behaviours for each household, the sample was clustered into five groups: (1) family households, (2) pensioner households, (3) high-saving-potential households, (4) low-income households, (5) higher-educated households. Short lists containing the most suitable tips for each group were compiled. These had substantially more favourable properties than other lists, compiled by only utilising a single criterion.

Through qualitative analysis of interviews with state-government legislators in the U.S., we show that when legislators evaluate and justify their support for and opposition to different types of renewable energy and energy efficiency (REEE) policies, they distinguish bills based on frames that are related to ideological differences (e.g., tax decreases, government efficiency, regulation, mandates, government spending). In turn the qualitative distinctions among bills are associated with quantitative differences in levels of support and success for the policies. Using data from a longitudinal analysis of 188 major state-government laws passed from 2004 to 2014 and a cross-sectional set of 709 passed and unpassed laws from 2011 to 2012, we show that REEE policies configured as mandates (e.g., renewable portfolio standards) have consistently lower levels of support than for similar REEE policies configured as tax reductions, reduction of government waste by increasing building efficiency, authorization of local government action, and regulatory reduction. Thus, via both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show that there are important ideology-associated differences in REEE policy that point to opportunities for more successful policy design.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"Electricity theft is a growing problem worldwide. India, like many other developing countries, is in the grips of electricity theft. To address this challenge, the country introduced various technological solutions, which failed to realize their promised potential. Despite little success, majority of theft-combat interventions continue to emphasize technology and downplay psycho-social factors. The latter calls for deep exploration as power-utility employees have been found to connive with consumers in majority of electricity thefts. Though, employee theft has been explained by distinct perspectives like sociology, psychology, criminology, organizational science etc., none describes the phenomenon completely. In order to gain a holistic understanding, it is imperative to integrate the said perspectives. That's precisely what this paper attempts- It proposes an integrated conceptual framework of the psycho-social factors that predispose employees to collude with consumers in electricity theft.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"Plans to triple or even quadruple Australian black coal production on 2010 levels by 2030 continue to inform the policy goals of Australian state and federal governments. However, only three years after many of these plans were either formally or informally approved, a number of them are no longer financially viable, and face mounting domestic and international opposition based on three main arguments: (a) the aggregated costs of subsidies, externalities and foreign-ownership in the Australian coal industry suggest that the economic benefits to Australia are not as great as the industry and its political backers claim; (b) although Australian black coal production is not likely to peak until the 2040s or later, world coal production is likely to peak around 2030, indicating that a transition to low or zero carbon energy sources in those countries currently dependent on coal is becoming an increasingly high priority from an energy security perspective; (c) because coal is one of the main contributors to anthropogenic climate change and Australia has some of the largest untapped reserves, most of that resource constitutes ‘unburnable carbon’. These three arguments provide a compelling case for the contraction of the Australian coal industry over the next twenty years.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"U.S. production of unconventional natural gas has increased rapidly over the last decade, and triggered public concerns about a variety of related risks. State policymakers vary in how they design regulatory policies to balance the anticipated risks and benefits, few attempts have been made, however, to evaluate the heterogeneity in state unconventional gas regulations. In this analysis, we develop a framework for comparing states based on how intensely they regulate unconventional gas development. We utilize two separate but complementary methodological approaches to investigate regulatory heterogeneity: an expert elicitation survey and principal components analysis. Our results indicate that, even though there is significant heterogeneity in state regulatory systems, there exist clusters of states that are consistently ranked at the top or the bottom along a continuum of regulatory stringency. States such as West Virginia, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico and Pennsylvania are found at the top of this scale, while at the lower end we find California, Tennessee, Mississippi and Montana. As states refine their regulatory systems, these rankings can be updated to reflect new policy and regulatory priorities.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"China and India—the two large expanding economies of the world—being not endowed with enough oil and gas, are heavily relying on imports to sustain their growth. The physical proximity of both these countries makes them deal with some of the oil/gas rich countries in their common neighborhood to secure energy through pipelines. This paper outlines consumer countries’ measures towards supplier and transit countries in economic, political, and social dimensions. It compares the approaches of China and India in terms of their investments, bilateral trade, political interference, level of strategic partnerships, and social and cultural linkages with the supplier and transit countries. Contrasting China’s two operational projects—Central Asia–China and Myanmar–China gas pipelines, with India’s two comparable proposals—Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India and Myanmar–Bangladesh–India gas pipelines, it gives rationale of China’s success and India’s lack of it in materializing these projects. The paper indicates policy gaps for both countries, particularly for India, in speedy realization of stalled projects and smooth functioning of ongoing ones. This study can be instrumental in providing a guideline of the measures a consumer country must undertake as part of its national strategy in supplier and transit countries to achieve energy security and geopolitical advantage.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"Environmental degradation and national energy security concerns are among the drivers of domestic and international policies directed towards reducing oil consumption. Often lost in these policy discussions are how such policies may affect world oil producing regions. Assuming a competitive market, a reservoir-specific world oil supply curve representing 2010 production and costs conditions is developed to specifically examine how reductions in world oil demand would affect oil producing regions and how changes in U.S. and world oil demand would affect U.S. dependence on foreign oil in a comparative static analysis. The supply curve is developed using a physical/cost simulator based on industry data. Because of the physical nature of oil reservoirs, countries would be affected differently by reductions in world oil demand. Many of the more impacted countries are relatively more politically unstable than countries with smaller effects. This unintended potential destabilization must be included in the discussion when considering policies to reduce world oil demand. In the absence of game changing technologies, discussion of the U.S. achieving self-sufficiency from demand side management appears to not be meaningful.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"In the European energy industry, different countries’ national institutional frameworks have evolved divergently in response to increasing concerns about environmental issues. This paper explores the influence of these divergent national institutional frameworks on the strategic behavior of multinational company (MNC) subsidiaries. Differences in MNC subsidiaries’ strategic decisions in different countries, regardless of common capabilities and strategies, illustrate the importance of this influence. The paper focuses on the strategic decisions that determine which energy technology MNCs choose to acquire or invest in. MNCs are the predominant force in the European energy industry, and our understanding of their strategic decisions regarding choice of technology is an essential step in achieving a low-carbon energy industry. Our analysis is based on a longitudinal case study of Vattenfall, a Swedish multinational energy company. Findings confirm that even in the energy industry—a capital-intensive, national, and institution-based industry—MNCs follow their core global strategy to such an extent that it may prevail over local institutional considerations. Nevertheless, as European energy markets become deregulated and renewable energy matures, local institutions are likely to play a more dominant role, and MNCs will increasingly need to comply with local institutions’ guidelines. The paper offers recommendations for policymakers and several managerial implications.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"This study investigates how energy-users from one low-carbon country – Denmark – perceive energy security threats and dimensions compared to those from ten other countries. The purpose, in part, is to discuss the relationship between consumer perceptions of energy challenges, adoption of renewable energy, climate change, and the prices of energy services. The article's primary source of data is a survey distributed in eight languages (English, Danish, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, German, and Japanese) to 2495 respondents in Brazil, China, Denmark, Germany, India, Kazakhstan, Japan, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and the United States. Survey results are used to test five propositions about energy security related to Denmark: the influence of culture, being “green,” the centrality of oil and gas, the salience of energy trade, and the necessity of affordable prices. The study concludes that Danish respondents rate energy security dimensions lower than most other countries, that responses invalidate a number of propositions stated in the academic literature, and that energy security is a complex topic both in theory and in practice. Furthermore the results suggest that consumer perceptions and attitudes about decentralized policy options (from the bottom-up) rate lower than governmental and institutional ones (from the top-down).",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"Since the oil crises in the 1970s, Denmark’s energy system has evolved from import- and fossil fuel-dependency to self-sufficiency with a high share of renewable energy. This transformation has been supported by co-evolving energy policies. A policy shift in 2001 brought a temporary halt to the transformation, which resumed after a return in policy in 2008. Applying public choice- and path-dependency perspectives, this article analyses the development of the Danish energy system and co-evolving policies. Initial structural characteristics have strong explanatory power for the long-term policy trend: de-central ownership, and entrepreneurship have given local-level actors leverage as a political constituency. Over time de-central small-scale solutions (like windpower and district heating) secured generous state aid. Local-level actors provided technology solutions offering broad opportunities. One consequence was strong support for de-central technology solutions. The first policy shift is explained by a new government that advocated dismantling state regulation, subsidies and taxes, supported by a new political majority. The second policy shift is explained by mobilization of interests that had grown to include actors that generally supported de-regulation but saw their commercial interests threatened. The Danish model has inspired similar transformations elsewhere and offers lessons on how to overcome resistance to change.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"Whilst cities are widely regarded as playing a pivotal role in energy transitions, recent research is highlighting the enormous variety of urban responses. This differentiated picture of urban energy transitions is helpfully opening up the debate to the multifarious factors shaping urban energy policy. What is in danger of getting lost in these powerfully ‘presentist’ narratives is a sense of where these urban responses are coming from and how historical legacies of energy production and use are influencing future options. This paper uses a comparative historical analysis of two iconic ‘electric cities’ – Berlin and Hong Kong – to explore the legacies of past socio-technical configurations for today’s attempts to realign urban energy systems. It investigates firstly, how, in response to their respective geo-political isolation prior to reunification in 1990/1997, the two cities strove to maximise local energy autarky for security reasons. The paper, secondly, demonstrates how political and economic reintegration in the 1990s has initiated a realignment of each city’s energy policy, as power grids become regionalised and local generation capacity questioned. We conclude by drawing implications from these historical legacies of energy autarky and regionalisation for the cities’ responses to the low carbon challenge today.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"In order to reconfigure global socio-economic systems to be compatible with social imperatives and planetary boundaries, a transition towards sustainable development is necessary. The multi-level perspective (MLP) has been developed to study long-term transformative change. This paper complements the MLP by providing an ontological framework for studying and understanding the role of narratives as the vehicle of meaning and intermediation between individual and social collective in the context of ongoing transitions. Narratives are established as an analytical entity to unpack how disturbances at the level of the socio-technical landscape are translated into and contribute to the transformation of socio-technical regimes. To illustrate and test the approach, it is applied to the case of the Fukushima catastrophe: The narratives in relation to nuclear power in Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom are scrutinized and it is explored how these narratives have co-determined the policy responses and thus influenced ongoing transformation processes in the power sectors of the respective countries.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"Low-carbon energy system transformations are usually seen from a technical perspective; the decisive societal dimensions of actors and institutions are widely neglected. We contribute to filling this gap by reviewing the German energy transition (Energiewende), which targets a competitive low-carbon economy until 2050, jointly from the three perspectives of technology, actors and institutions. We analyze seven sub-fields of the electricity system that are central for decarbonization from a technology view. For each, we identify and characterize key actors and institutional conditions for future electricity infrastructure developments they favor. The analysis reveals a large variety of engaged actors that differ with respect to their motives and underlying worldviews. Electricity infrastructure visions range from the archetypes of decentralized regional solutions (favored by challengers) to centralized European solutions (favored by incumbents). We illustrate that the determining factors for both developments are primarily of institutional nature and will be fought out between actors in the political arena. From a technology perspective centralized and decentralized solutions may well coexist to a certain degree. However, in either case the long latency period in technical infrastructure development requires anticipatory planning.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"Concepts of justice are now routinely mobilised in environmental and climate change activism, with movements for environmental and climate justice emerging around the world. More recently, the concept of energy justice has gained prominence, most frequently framed in terms of access to affordable energy and fuel poverty but also related to the politics of energy infrastructures. To date however, there has been little critical interrogation of energy justice in relation to actions undertaken by activist and advocacy movements. In this paper, we set out an analysis of the concept of ‘energy justice’ from the perspective of framing. Drawing on research with organisations in Philadelphia, Paris and Berlin, the paper explores the articulation and elaboration of an energy justice frame. In so doing, it explores how such actors strategically frame their interpretation of energy justice, considers the overall emergence of an energy justice frame, and draws out an agenda for future research.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"Energy justice has emerged as a new crosscutting social science research agenda which seeks to apply justice principles to energy policy, energy production and systems, energy consumption, energy activism, energy security and climate change. A conceptual review is now required for the consolidation and logical extension of this field. Within this exploration, we give an account of its core tenets: distributional, recognition and procedural. Later we promote the application of this three-pronged approach across the energy system, within the global context of energy production and consumption. Thus, we offer both a conceptual review and a research agenda. Throughout, we explore the key dimensions of this new agenda – its evaluative and normative reach – demonstrating that energy justice offers, firstly, an opportunity to explore where injustices occur, developing new processes of avoidance and remediation and recognizing new sections of society. Secondly, we illustrate that energy justice provides a new stimulating framework for bridging existing and future research on energy production and consumption when whole energy systems approaches are integrated into research designs. In conclusion, we suggest three areas for future research: investigating the non-activist origins of energy justice, engaging with economics, and uniting systems of production and consumption.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"For more than 25 years, excess winter deaths (EWDs) have been associated with adverse respiratory and cardiovascular events. More recently, an association between EWDs and a new spectrum of morbidity has been noted by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for England and Wales: since at least 2009, a high prevalence of excess winter mortality has also been evident among people living with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD). In the present study, excess winter mortality data for all of the UK (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) are analysed, using a longer time series (22 years). Results corroborate ONS findings related to elevated risk of death during winter for people living with ADRD. Seasonal effects have been sustained throughout the 22 year period, and people with ADRD emerge as being at greater risk of a winter death than people with cardiovascular conditions. Establishing the reasons for such pronounced seasonal mortality patterns among people with ADRD could help ensure better energy justice for people living with the severe mental impairments imposed by these conditions, guiding more effective delivery of energy efficiency and health services to people living with this increasingly prevalent disease spectrum.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39
"In communities experiencing shale gas development, the local media are an important information source on potential impacts of development; their coverage generates and spreads social representations of this issue. We examine representations of natural gas development through a content analysis of six regional newspapers in the northern United States (n = 1,958 articles) – two each in Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania. Previous research showed similarities between the New York and Pennsylvania newspapers; differences emerged in nearby Ohio’s coverage. In Ohio, similar percentages of articles mentioned economic impacts as in Pennsylvania and New York, but significantly fewer articles mentioned environmental or social impacts. Furthermore, valence of economic and social impacts was notably more positive in Ohio. This analysis highlights nuances inherent in regional discourse about shale gas development. In turn, these differences have implications for: (1) how politicians, journalists, activists, and researchers can better communicate about shale gas development, (2) policy/regulation of development, and (3) future research on social representations of emergent forms of energy extraction. We suggest the need, in social science research on energy development, to examine societal-level (not merely individual) influences on perceptions and to account for nuances inherent in regional variation – infrequently manifest in national sample studies.",Volume 11,January 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/11/suppl/C,39

"The guidelines for Trans-European Energy Network planning foresee the application of a neutral pan-European transmission cost–benefit analysis (CBA) to facilitate the optimal expansion of the electricity transmission system. This CBA is to provide neutral cost–benefit information for the identification of the most profitable transmission projects and to help reduce public opposition by showing the objective costs and benefits of new projects. We review and discuss a wide range of literature related to the ontological, epistemological and economic theory foundations of CBA. Our analysis shows that the results of a CBA are based on several value-judgements linked to the standpoint of the analyst; the non-comparability of interpersonal utility; flawed data from willingness-to-pay/willingness-to-accept methods; the arbitrariness of social discount rates; and the status-quo bias of the Pareto efficiency and Kaldor–Hicks principles. Therefore, a pan-European transmission CBA cannot generate neutral information and will fail its core objective of providing unbiased information. The way it is designed, the CBA obscures different stakeholder perspectives and is biased towards a particular set of values. Hence, we expect it to increase, rather than to reduce, public opposition to power lines in Europe. We propose a participatory approach to alleviate some of the problems of the pan-European CBA.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40

In this paper, we develop an applied approach to support interdisciplinary research focusing on a common research objective which examines and clarifies the three questions: ‘What’, ‘Why’ and ‘How’.

"An increasing number of studies suggest that the cumulative impacts of wind turbine encounters might have a negative impact on the acceptance of onshore wind power development. In many countries offshore wind resources are seen as the new wind energy resource, though the offshore cost of energy is markedly higher compared to onshore. In the present paper it is tested if the cumulative effect of wind turbines makes people favour offshore wind turbine development to onshore development. The results suggest that the cumulative effects from wind turbine encounters have weak effects on the relative attitude towards more onshore and offshore wind power development. This suggests that increasing onshore wind power development does not make people favour offshore wind power development to a higher extent.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"Increasing penetration of residential photovoltaic (PV) systems has intensified concerns over the related impacts on utility revenue and the equity of deployment subsidies. Community solar (CS) has surfaced as an alternative deployment model for PV that could potentially mitigate these concerns, while integrating distributed solar PV. Given the potential that CS holds in stabilizing the customer-utility relationship amid deeper penetration of distributed solar, in this paper we combine four complementary datasets to analyze how policy, regulatory, and market factors impact the deployment of CS. Specifically, we present a detailed assessment of CS deployment in the United States, including pertinent insights relating to nameplate capacity, billing models, propensities of off-taker utilities to adopt different types of CS, and local market and policy drivers. We find that accounting for both underlying demand and policy/regulatory conditions is essential for understanding the nuanced connections between utility strategy and CS adoption. A particularly interesting finding, stemming consistently across the multiple data streams we analyze, is that utilities are motivated to develop CS not only to satisfy consumer demand or regulatory requirements for renewable energy, but also to alleviate revenue losses related to residential solar PV.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40

This deficiency is addressed by examining the determinants of tourist preferences for positioning of wind farms in the Mediterranean Sea. A principal component analysis is used to identify general attitudinal themes that act as covariates in a choice model.

"Wind energy development on land has faced local opposition for reasons such as effects on cultural landscapes and wildlife, which can be instrumental in whether or not and the speed with which a project moves toward completion. Offshore wind can generate electricity where onshore wind is limited. Factors leading to support for, or opposition to, offshore wind energy are not well known, particularly for developments that are near-shore and in-view of coastal communities. Here we present results from a survey of 699 residents (35.5% response rate) completed in 2013 in greater Atlantic City, New Jersey and coastal Delaware, United States, where near-shore wind demonstration projects had been proposed. We examined how the public considers the societal tradeoffs that are made to develop small-scale, in-view demonstration wind projects instead of larger facilities farther offshore. Results indicate that a strong majority of the public supports near-shore demonstration wind projects. We find the primary reasons for support include benefits to wildlife, cost of electricity, and job creation, while the primary reasons for opposition include wildlife impacts, aesthetics, tourism, and user conflicts.

"The share of solar energy in German electricity supply has increased rapidly in recent years. This is due to guaranteed feed-in tariffs in conjunction with decreasing prices for solar panels. However, little is known on geographical factors, settlement structure, neighborhood effects or the crucial role of middle actors for the spatial distribution of photovoltaics. The presented study addresses these issues by accounting for more than 820,000 small-scale installations (≤16 kWp) registered between 1991 and 2012.It turns out that the installed capacity (and generated supply) from small-scale installations clearly varies among German counties. Based on econometric analysis, this can partly be explained by differences in solar radiation.

"This evaluation investigates the experiences of 5 low-income families in Northern Ireland who moved into new homes built using an innovative building design that dispensed with central heating. The design was able to achieve high standards of energy efficiency through raised standards of insulation, airtightness, and a heat recovery system. This paper gives an account of how families adapted to their new home and novel heating regimes. To do this, the study gathered accounts of household everyday experiences across the first 2 winters; electricity consumption was also tracked fortnightly using data downloads from smart meters. Compared with the average cost of powering a more conventional home in Northern Ireland at that time, energy consumption in the first year was 20% less than in the average newly built gas-fired home, and 34% less than the average oil-fired new build. When followed up after a second winter, the households had achieved improved levels of thermal comfort, whilst reducing their winter energy costs by a further 9%.

"IFORE (Innovation for Renewal) is an EU Interreg funded partnership including two large housing associations, one in England, one in France, and a university from each country. The project is an exemplar large-scale retrofit, 100 houses have been retrofitted at Rushenden, on the Isle of Sheppey (Kent, England), and a similar number at Outreau, a suburb of Boulogne (Pas-de-Calais, France). This paper offers an overview of the methods used by the project team to find common solutions and to identify similarities between retrofit measures and occupant's behaviour in both countries. The cross-border nature of IFORE makes the project also original in relation to other similar national retrofit projects that have been developed prior to it. Dynamic thermal simulation was used to evaluate the thermal behaviour of the buildings refurbished. It is a valuable decision-making tool when assessing alternative retrofit measures. Initial surveys were carried out to make a classification of the housing stock which formed the context for the computer simulations. Some results from the simulations, carried out with ESP-r in England and Pleiade + Comfie in France, are presented in this paper. The comparison of the results from the two simulation tools shows great similarity between the two methods, which gave confidence for their use in evaluating alternative specifications for the works that have now been adopted for retrofit.

"Major energy-relevant investment decisions by households remain a large but underdeveloped opportunity for reducing energy consumption globally. Research into these decisions, however, has not been cumulative. We reviewed 26 empirical studies, which examined a variety of such decisions in multiple investment domains, examining a variety of explanatory variables, using various methods. We distinguished 17 domains of energy-relevant investment decisions covering retrofit measures (e.g. insulation) and renewable energy systems (e.g. photovoltaic energy). We identified six types of explanatory variables considered in the studies: demographic/housing characteristics/location of residence (I), decision-maker dispositions (II), beliefs about consequences for (III) and beyond (IV) the household, social influences (V) and policy measures (VI). Energy-relevant investment decisions were often associated with beliefs about consequences for and beyond the household and with receiving energy consulting and financial incentives, although the effectiveness of financial measures appears to depend on how they are implemented.

"This study identifies factors that affect the adoption behavior for residential Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, including a spatial and temporal contagion effect, house characteristics, and other economic and contextual factors. The study draws on a dataset of house sale records in the greater Chicago area, spanning 1992–2004. First-differenced models and restricting the sample to new construction allow separate identification of adoption determinants for homeowners and for developers, respectively. We show that attributes of the building stock and demographics influence adoption decisions of both homeowners and developers. This includes a strong influence of square footage, a modest spatial clustering effect for existing homes, a consistent deterrent effect of higher property tax rates, and a positive influence of neighborhood education levels. Adoption decisions for existing homeowners appear to be driven by different factors than sellers of newly constructed homes. Adoption coincided with multi-story homes for developers, and neighbor adoption rates predicted adoption by existing homeowners but not developers.

"Household energy consumption remains ripe for behavioral intervention, being responsible for an estimated 31% of U.S. CO2 emissions. As researchers attempt to understand the factors that influence household energy efficiency behaviors, we suggest it is important to attend to behavioral plasticity—how the perceived difficulty of behavioral responses varies across individuals, behaviors, and contexts. We present a new instrument composed of behaviors identified in previous analyses as having the highest impact on residential energy consumption. Our instrument allows for the specific measurement of self-reported behaviors, behavioral intentions, and inability to perform behaviors. Results from a convenience sample of 1522 U.S. adults demonstrate the construct validity of this instrument, as key factors known to influence pro-environmental behaviors—e.g., key environmental beliefs and attitudes—predict household energy efficiency behaviors.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"Energy efficiency technology is widely accepted as a positive step to improve the comfort of homes whilst simultaneously reducing harmful carbon emissions. There is a convincing case that more widespread adoption of energy efficiency technology is required, yet paradoxically, the identification of households as being in need of assistance to do so, may, we argue, be stigmatizing. Recent literature has begun to explore the role of stigma in domestic energy-saving practices but such scholarship is restricted beyond a few studies. In this exploratory paper we respond to calls for social scientists to engage with energy research, and redress this neglect by outlining the nature of the relationship between energy efficiency and stigma. We also seek to develop an emerging research agenda, which draws theoretical influence from Sociology and Housing Studies.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"Households are increasingly subject to environmental regulation and intervention in today’s carbon-constrained world. Highlighting cross- disciplinary synergies between practice theory and material geographies, I illuminate the lived complexities of everyday energy-use in Singapore. Based on an ethnographic study of 8 households, it is apparent that energy practices are sustained and reproduced through the subjectivities of materialities, practical ethics, socialised rules and histories, embedded withinin the spatio-temporalities of the actually-existing household. For energy conservation policy and research, these findings suggest non- engagement with the complexities of household energy-use. By promoting a single normative vision of ‘Green’ energy practices, energy conservation initiatives risk alienating people with practices that do not resonate with household dynamics as they are lived. Instead, an enagement of ‘practices’ instead of ‘behavior’ opens up a more expansive field for research and policy engagement in the dynamic and path dependent processes of social normality, and more effective means of encouraging more sustainable ways of living.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"Many energy consuming household activities are collectively organized, while in information campaigns for energy conservation they are regarded as planned and performed by individuals in isolation. This article aims at scrutinizing this mismatch by analytically examining how energy-consuming activities are allocated and organized among household members and explore the implications for energy consumption. Time-geographic concepts ground for the investigation and empirical illustrations are taken from a uniquely rich historic Swedish pilot study on time-use from 1996. The pilot offers time-diaries from members of the same households which allow analysis on activity allocation in the households. We present a conceptual framework with two overarching principles of activity allocation; project division and project sharing. Visualizations of daily activity sequences from time-diaries in the pilot study are used to analyze the household project providing meals. The overall result indicates that the ways households allocate and coordinate energy consuming activities matter to energy use. Consequently, it is important to consider the household with its members for understanding daily energy consuming activities and people's possibilities to conserve energy. If reconfigured to fit into the interlinked everyday life activity sequences of household members, energy advice and information campaigns might improve the opportunities to reach their targets.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"Considering the insufficient results achieved so far by energy-saving policies, the stance of this paper is to depart from an ‘expert’ view and base the analysis on those energy-related practices that are meaningful to practitioners (e.g., showering, cooking, listening to music). The framework described in this paper builds on the concept of habitual practices. Its rationale is to provide a precise characterisation of household energy-related practices allowing for a good understanding of their content together with a clearer picture of how they are formed and sustained over time. This constitutes a necessary step prior to reflecting on the type of interventions that could influence practices towards more sustainable configurations. The notion of ‘grips’ is then introduced with the aim of putting this characterisation into a form that is more operational for policy-makers. Grips are elements that have to be ‘(de-) activated’ for supporting a targeted behavioral change. Identifying grips can enrich the characterization of consumption profiles and then be used as a dialogue interface between those profiles and the design of innovative energy-saving tools. This scheme is then applied within a dynamic perspective of the change process whereby a new practice has to be triggered, sustained and stabilized.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"In homes and offices across the UK, increasingly sophisticated smart metering systems are being hailed as a crucial weapon in the fight against climate change through a focus on energy demand reduction. Using the example of Current, a multi-disciplinary project focused on energy use in large office environments, this paper reflects upon the metering process on a university campus and the challenges and opportunities that it poses for energy management. Through an exploration of the relationships between the human and non-human actors that are involved in energy consumption and metering (staff, students, radiators, data loggers, thermostats, computers and building insulation, to name but a few examples), we show that, rather than being used to critique and apportion blame for energy consumption, measurement systems which attempt to quantify that consumption can provide the opportunity to ask fresh questions about agency, responsibility and the relationships between people and things in ways that can help us work towards creative solutions for more sustainable futures.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"The case for public investment in biofuels hinges on reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from transportation, a major cause of global warming. Yet the long-term sustainability of such fuels remains undetermined, in part because of lagging innovation. The US Department of Defense (DoD) seeks to hasten innovation in drop-in synthetics, chemically indistinguishable from petroleum fuels, by holding out the prospect of volume purchases of biokerosene. DoD's procurement-centered approach contrasts with that of the US Department of Energy, which has been mostly content to fund undirected research. DoD justifies its policy on the basis of energy security and high and volatile oil prices—weak rationales both. Nonetheless, a number of policy pieces are in place and will probably remain. The overall thrust could be strengthened by increasing incentives for drop-in synthetics and making explicit provision for assessment of long-term sustainability based on actual operating experience.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"This review highlights what has been learnt from research on West Africa’s oil economy, Ghana and what remains to be studied. The existing knowledge about the industry is both analytical (entailing different frames of thinking, such as enclave and linkages approaches) and empirical (including in what ways is the oil resource a blessing, a curse, or both and to what extent regulations can attenuate or accentuate undesirable outcomes). The existing research shows that to probe whether there is a resource curse/blessing is to ask the question the wrong way. Instead, it is more useful to ask in what ways the oil and gas industry in Ghana driven by a fear of resource curse moulds and is moulded by institutions and aspirations. The tendency has been to emphasise the need for more economic growth and avoid state corruption. Steeped in mainstream economic management, the interest is in bolstering growth-enhancing processes, such as attenuating currency instability and expending limited revenue on social development as a right because such social expenditure is ‘unsustainable’. While this emphasis can achieve the important goal of stabilising the economy, it totally ignores or superficially considers the more complex ramifications of oil and gas extraction, namely the growing sphere of influence of transnational oil companies some of which have become key actors in planning, inequalities across space in terms of income and productive resources, exploitation of women, especially, and labour more generally, and ecological pillage. When the policy focal lenses are changed to emphasise these other ramifications, both the implications for and possibilities to use oil resources for social development become more clearly evident and the need to re-theorise the ramifications of oil ever more pressing. In spite of this contribution to the global energy debate, the existing body of knowledge in Ghana is weak in the sense that it lacks a careful theorisation of oil as part of the biogas–electricity–oil–gas–biofuel complex, how this complex is melded into the local/global capitalist mode of production, contradictions in the process, attempts at attenuating these contradictory processes, and how these attempts, in turn, cause different and differential experiences across the entire spectrum (up, mid, and downstream) of oil production, distribution, and consumption. To address these gaps, this article briefly describes several new approaches that could be used to bolster theorisation of the oil and gas industry.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"In India, where energy access is limited, how does the public react to the government's inability to provide citizens with basic energy services, such as electricity and clean cooking fuel? We answer this question using a survey conducted in two rural villages of Uttar Pradesh. First, we examine the association between a respondent's opinion on state intervention and policy failure. Specifically, we focus on whether people who believe in state intervention are likely to have lower levels of satisfaction with the government's energy access policies. Second, we examine the link between policy failure and the likelihood that people consider a political candidate's energy views in voting. We find that people's preference for government intervention has a negative effect on satisfaction levels with government policies, and that people who blame the government for policy failures are less likely to take a political candidate's energy policies into account when voting.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"Energy-related development aid has diversified significantly over time. With insights from eight donor-driven renewable energy projects in the Philippines, this qualitative study highlights the effects of a diversified development aid landscape on renewable energy development. The comparison reveals both positive and negative results. On the one hand, the Philippine government can benefit from competition among donors for national policy advice. On the other hand, small-scale solar power demonstration projects suffer from obstacles that should have been known already from previous donor-driven interventions. The article recommends stronger forms of donor coordination. A differentiation between national and local level projects turns out to be beneficiary for the broader debate on aid diversification.

"Turkey is currently in the middle of its sixth attempt over the last 60 years to introduce nuclear power. This paper analyzes Turkey’s past and present motivation, capacity and strategies to identify the factors which influence deployment of nuclear power and draw lessons for other nuclear newcomer countries. While existing literature points to a correlation between nuclear power, strong state involvement, centralized energy planning and the rhetoric linking energy to national prestige and security, we show that these factors are not sufficient for a successful nuclear program. We also show that autocratic rule and nuclear weapons aspirations can undermine rather than support the development of civilian nuclear power as it is often presumed in the literature. Turkey’s current strategy based on intergovernmental agreements with Russia and Japan is laced with irony since it is motivated by energy security considerations and yet relies on foreign entities for construction, ownership and operation of nuclear power plants as well as the development of human capacity. Although Ankara intends to build the third nuclear power plant with own resources this seems unlikely based on the South Korean and Japanese experience, both of which needed much more time and effort to localize the industry.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"Previous studies have shown that fossil energy systems can be a conflict objective, means or cause. This study explores how renewable energy (RE) systems can interact with conflicts and to what extent the risk of different conflicts may change. Renewable resources, in contrast to conventional fossil resources, are more difficult to control in time and space. RE systems depend on exploiting flows rather than extracting stocks, are geographically more evenly distributed, and the energy density is lower. As a consequence, economic and geopolitical incentives for states to engage in conflicts to secure or control RE resources are low. However, increased competition for land increases the risk of local conflicts that involve non-state actors, since it can reduce actor's ecological space. Distribution and use of RE can be designed to have a low risk of interacting with conflicts, but the success of this depends on the technologies implemented and other sustainability policies. Increased dependence on control systems used to manage variable electricity production increase exposure to cyber threats while as small-scale distributed generation reduce incentives to attack the system since such systems are less sensitive to attacks.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"This paper offers an integrated conceptual framework for the research and amelioration of energy deprivation in the home. It starts from the premise that all forms of energy and fuel poverty – in developed and developing countries alike – are underpinned by a common condition: the inability to attain a socially and materially necessitated level of domestic energy services. We consider the functionings provided by energy demand in the residential domain in order to advance two claims: first, that domestic energy deprivation in its different guises and forms is fundamentally tied to the ineffective operation of the socio-technical pathways that allow for the fulfilment of household energy needs, and as such is best analyzed by understanding the constitution of different energy services (heating, lighting, etc.) in the home. Second, we emphasize the ability of vulnerability thinking to encapsulate the driving forces of domestic energy deprivation via a comprehensive analytical matrix. The paper identifies the main components and implications of energy service and vulnerability approaches as they relate to domestic energy deprivation across the world.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"This paper considers the relationship between fuel poverty, disabled people, and policy changes in England, drawing on concepts of justice to deconstruct and explain empirical findings. Drawing on statistical analyses of the English Housing Survey, the paper presents three key findings. Firstly that fuel poverty rates in England are typically higher amongst households containing disabled people; secondly that high levels of fuel poverty are found amongst single disabled people of working age; and thirdly, that a greater proportion of households containing disabled people are on prepayment meters compared to other households. These distributional inequalities are explored in terms of ‘justice as recognition’. The paper concludes that the distributive inequalities evident in the findings may have been driven by a lack of recognition by energy policy makers in terms of their understanding of the highly varied needs of disabled people, the impact of current measures of fuel poverty, and the way in which disability benefits are understood within calculations of fuel poverty. Moreover, it is argued that current political rhetoric that typically marginalises disabled people of working age on low incomes has further driven distributional inequalities.",Volume 10,November 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/10/suppl/C,40
"This paper serves as an introduction to a special issue on smart grids and the social sciences. There is currently a discourse of very high ambitions and anticipation regarding how the implementation of a broad collection of smart grid related technologies across scales and geographies would influence the performance of electricity grids, and through this play an essential role in energy transition processes, renewable energy implementation, de-carbonization etc. So far, the question of how to achieve the desired goals has largely been a technical endeavor. In this special issue, and in this paper, we explore some of the ways through which social scientists have begun to engage the smart grid development. Here, research mainly targets three distinct areas of scientific research. First, emerging infrastructures attract a large number of imaginaries or visions, which can be studied. Second, smart grids have explicit expectations towards its users inscribed in them. The second group of contributions gathered here traces these types of inscriptions and the various relationships that might emerge between new technologies and publics at different scales. Third, infrastructures are large socio-technical systems that have to be built. Studies of this kind of system building and transformation are collected in the third part of this issue.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"A future “Smart Grid” is increasingly being embraced in energy policies as a promising energy scenario for the future, with the introduction of “smart” electricity meters being seen as the first step. In Norway, this process is happening without much public debate. Discussions of complexity and uncertainty related to the future Smart Grid are mainly taking place within a network of actors with recognized expertise. Based on empirical data from interviews and documentary analysis, this paper describes sociotechnical energy imaginaries of a future Smart Grid in a Norwegian context from within this network of experts, which is conceptualized as a techno-epistemic network.The future imaginaries of smart meters and a future Smart Grid are mainly technological and economical, and they are partly permeated by national imaginations. They connect the past and the future by providing solutions for current challenges in the energy supply system, which reflect current institutional and technological structures. The imaginaries also include constructions of the public, or “consumers”, which has implications for the communication to the public. The paper suggests that increased openness and the inclusion of multiple perspectives and ways of knowing, inspired by post-normal science, could facilitate more careful consideration of potential social implications.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"This paper answers an important question consensually identified as crucial for smart grid roll-out. Our objective is to highlight the reasons for economic, technological and regulatory uncertainty continuing in the smart grid sector. The argument of this paper is that to face uncertainty, actors adopted strategic positioning but not systematically favoring the emergence of a structuring and shared vision of smart grid. However, converging visions are necessary to limit uncertainty and thus secure the sector’s development and durability in the coming years.The results presented here are based on two methodological approaches. First, a social network analysis of worldwide relationships between smart grid actors has been performed to characterize the actors’ positioning strategies. The paper identifies four categories of actors: local observers, global observers, experimenters, and central actors. Second, a qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with approximately 30 French smart grid stakeholders gave us information on discourses and perceptions of the sector's reality and constraints. It appeared that smart grid merges both long-established actors in the smart grid focal sector, i.e., energy, promoting a highly accurate but strictly energy-oriented perception, and new entrants coming from related sectors such as ICT, offering an open but indistinct perspective. Therefore, stakeholders diverge on the definition and potential source of added value.These results help to elucidate the transition of socio-technical systems. Indeed, at this very moment when contextual uncertainty remains high, it appears that actors from the focal sector play a crucial part in driving the current sector development, whereas new entrants remain unable to modify the sector’s regime decisively. One can interpret this situation as a sign of the failure of the smart grid sector to emerge as such. Conversely, one can see here an evolution of focal actors’ strategies regarding uncertainty in an innovative socio-technical system in transition. To solve this issue, further studies should be conducted both on the smart grid sector to see how it will evolve and on other sectors to search for similar trends.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"In technical terms, a micro smart grid is one solution for future energy supply from renewable energy sources with the aid of information technology. However, it also symbolises the idea of a transformation into a low-carbon, non-fossil-fuel society. This paper analyses that the micro smart grid works as a sociotechnical imaginary and boundary object across a specific actor constellation with plural backgrounds, interests and perspectives. Empirical data has been gathered for this study from an urban innovation campus in Germany, an ascribed living lab for innovation and research that represents an especially designated place combined with spatially embedded visions of the future city and energy system. Here the micro smart grid imaginary is closely interlinked with the place and becomes materialised: it is argued that despite the micro smart grid's incomplete status in terms of technical advancement and reliability, the imaginary already generates cooperation and commitment across actor groups and sectors. The place provides a shared, protected experimental space as well as boundary objects, thus, first, enabling the actors to cope with the perceived uncertainty in the transition process. Second, it fosters innovation, new business models and forms of cooperation, and thereby, third, contributes to the energy system transformation.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"The gradual implementation of smart grid solutions is accompanied by an increased concern amongst researchers and policymakers for the role of users in such systems. For smart grids to perform as expected, the role of users in electricity systems must change. One approach to technology-user relationships proposes that the chance of success increases through involving users in the design and development of technologies. This article reports on a research project that set out to involve what was perceived as active and competent users in the design of feedback technologies. We explore how users were imagined in the project, and how the idea of active user participation was shadowed by an ambivalent and paradoxical view of users as knowledge deficient and incompetent. The case illustrates how the boundaries between involving users and by-passing users becomes blurred. Through this, we contribute to the knowledge on how user imaginaries and future expectations influence research and innovation processes, illustrating how traditional models of knowledge deficiency can lead to minimal user engagement.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"According to many visions for smart grids, consumers will come to play a more ‘active’ role in the energy systems of tomorrow. In this paper, we examine how the future ‘flexible electricity consumer’ is imagined in the Danish National Smart Grid Strategy. Our analysis of reports produced by the national Smart Grid Network shows that this vision relies on a techno-centric and rather ‘inflexible’ consumer figuration. However, rather than adopting a conventional social science approach in order to criticize this narrow imaginary, we show that potentials for critique and alternatives can be found internally in the Smart Grid Network. Paying attention to different stories, we thus aim to characterize particular forms of ‘infra-critique’ and ‘infra-reflexivity’ emerging from within the field. This mode of reflexivity, we argue, opens up to more flexible and reflexive conceptions of the ‘flexible electricity consumer’ as well as more flexible relations between ‘the technical’ and ‘the social.’","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"Smart charging systems for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are one promising smart grid technology that has the potential to help balance energy supply and demand. In the present study, we aimed to investigate users' real-life experiences with a smart charging system and their evaluation of it.In a 5-month field trial, 10 BEV drivers compared conventional BEV charging with smart charging. Via smartphone application, users could modify settings which determined the charging process (e.g., departure times). Before and after experiencing the prototype system, users' motivation, attitudes, willingness to use smart charging and charging behavior were assessed via interviews and questionnaires. Furthermore, participants reported how they experienced and integrated the smart charging system. Results showed that users were motivated and positive about the system at both points of data collection. On average, users agreed that the system is suitable for daily life, reliable and trustworthy. They were willing to use smart charging before and after testing it, but some participants stated that reliability of the system should be improved. In sum, results indicate that a smart charging system like the one implemented in this study is assimilable in everyday life and provide valuable indications for further development of smart charging systems.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"Domestic demand-side response (DSR), if widely adopted, could help make electricity more secure, clean and affordable. However, little is known about consumer demand for different approaches to achieving DSR. This study aimed to gauge the acceptability of a range of DSR tariffs, and explore factors affecting it. An online between-subjects survey experiment was deployed to a representative sample of bill payers in Great Britain (N = 2002), testing five tariffs including static/dynamic time of use (TOU) pricing (with/without automated response to price changes) and direct load control (DLC) of heating on a below-average flat rate.The tariff permitting limited DLC of heating was significantly (p < .01) more popular than the TOU tariffs. This was surprising given evidence for concern around loss of control in DLC, and suggests that for many people DLC is acceptable in principle (within tight bounds and with override ability). The option of automated response made dynamic TOU (otherwise the least popular tariff) as acceptable as static TOU. This is important because dynamic TOU offers additional network benefits, while automation can improve duration and reliability of response. The TOU tariffs were rated highly for giving people control over spending on electricity, but other factors were more associated with overall acceptance.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"Feedback is generally accepted as a suitable intervention technique to foster electricity saving in households. In this domain, smart meters are one promising way to deliver feedback in everyday settings. However, research has shown that feedback by itself is hardly sufficient. Hence, for a more effective design of smart meters, the opportunities which these offer to deliver feedback and to supplement this with other information should be considered. This article describes the specific characteristics of household electricity consumption that should be taken into account. Also, a comprehensive psychological model of self-regulated behaviour change that covers the complete process by which new types of behaviour are chosen and implemented is described in detail and different behavioural stages and components crucial for the design of information strategies are identified. A detailed overview is given of different existing applications and which stages of change these affect. However, as none of these existing smart meters features comprehensive and combined informational strategies that systematically cater to consumers in all stages of behavioural change, it is concluded that further efforts to optimise and evaluate smart meters should be undertaken. A smart meter information system which is designed according to these insights is outlined.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41

"Smart grids, smart metering and in-home displays (IHD) are expected to contribute to demand side management partly by increasing user knowledge whilst improving comfort, safety and the ability to cope with increasing costs. With an increasingly ageing population, the awareness and views of older people on energy use, technology, smart meters, smart grids are becoming progressively more important. Their behaviours regarding energy and technology use differ from the majority as they are usually living on low incomes and are at risk of fuel poverty. It is therefore important to understand their acceptance, engagement or resistance to smart metering, IHDs and external control of home appliances and heating. Their willingness and capacity to change time-use behaviours and reduce consumption is crucial.A study of older tenants in rural Scotland is presented. Sensors and IHDs were installed to measure and display electricity costs and consumption of large appliances and the electricity supply for each house, and show internal household and external temperatures. Householder’s use of energy, habits and routine, strategies for keeping warm and attitudes towards technology, smart metering, IHDs and direct external control of appliances and heating were explored through interviews. Conclusions identify significant implications for future research and policy.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"Smart grid technologies enable introduction of time-of-use (TOU) tariffs which aim to reduce peak demand. TOU tariffs are presented as financial opportunities but outcomes depend on flexibility in household practices. Households with children have higher peak electricity consumption and this paper investigates how and why practices performed during the weekday peak ‘hang together’.We conducted forty-four interviews and home tours followed by a survey (547 responses) of households with children in Australia. Our analysis finds that the family peak is tightly coordinated and routinised. Interlinked bundles of practices were meaningful beyond their commonly assumed functions. For example, bathing of children (re-) connected siblings and parents, occupied children while dinner was prepared or cleaned up, and calmed children in preparation for sleeping. The analysis also shows how flexibility during the peak period is constrained by the relation to other periods of the weekday, along with its synchronisation with school, work and childcare arrangements.From our analysis of we conclude that TOU tariffs are unlikely to effectively reduce peak period electricity consumption in households with children and may have inequitable financial and/or social impacts for these households. Alternative approaches that better engage with the dynamics of social practice in family households are suggested.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"This paper examines the participation of Dutch households in a smart and sustainable energy transition. Particular attention is paid to new forms of cooperation that are arising between households (horizontal opening-up) and between households and service providers (vertical opening-up). Data are drawn from an online survey and a focus group discussion among householders who have some experience with sustainable energy practices. To guide the analysis we discern three energy management practices that come along with the advent of smart energy systems (energy monitoring, renewable energy production and time-shifting), and three social arrangements entailing different ways of organising these practices (private, horizontal and vertical arrangements). While survey respondents, in general, prove to be supportive of both vertically and horizontally arranged energy management practices, we also find that they run into specific privacy and autonomy problems that shape or even impede their participation. In addition, the focus group shows that shared understandings of conventional energy systems and shared experiences with alternative schemes create strong parallels between anticipated arrangements of new practices. It is concluded that decentralised systems are particularly promising for promoting householder participation, as they enable the bundling of energy management practices and the renegotiation of horizontal–vertical relationships.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"Smart Grid applications, such as energy feedback systems, load shifting for smart homes, and smart charging of electric vehicles provide new possibilities to support the incorporation of renewables. Aside from technical feasibility, consumer requirements and concerns, particularly in terms of the protection of personal privacy, have not been the focus of Smart Grid developments. We therefore investigated consumers’ Smart Grid related privacy concerns in private and business contexts and focused on the research questions: (1) who is perceived as a trustworthy authority for energy data storage? (2) What can pose as a privacy threat for consumers? (3) How should energy data be handled by an ICT infrastructure? We conducted a comprehensive online survey (N = 240) in Austria to gain an overview into the concerns and deepened our understanding by conducting two focus groups (N = 15). Our results indicate the importance of decentralized data storage, access control, as well as information transparency and the incorporation of privacy enhancing functionalities. Consumer-driven requirements and technical requirements led to a suggestion for a privacy preserving ICT infrastructure, following the paradigm of a service-oriented architecture.

"Efficiency targets proposed as part of international commitments to reduce CO2 emissions include future changes in individual patterns of energy consumption. This goal is presently being addressed in France through the installation of smart meters. Considering that public resistance or blatant opposition could jeopardize the grid modernization in the whole country, this study focused on the responses of groups of citizens from the two French communities where the new meters were first installed: Château-Renault (rural) and Lyon (urban). This study used the method of reconvened focus groups to inform policymakers about the reasoning of citizens in this situation. The discussions and the material generated by the groups provided very concrete elements on how the participants tried to make sense of the meter device itself and the policy goals, in relation to their daily and social life. The exchanges between participants seemed to fit into three main dialogical pairs, or themata: collective vs. individual (daily life); private (my behaviour) vs. public spheres (others’ behaviours); and consumption: individualist vs. collectivist. The collective elaboration throughout the group sessions reinforced the empowerment of the groups and led to considering more collectively-oriented approaches in contrast to the prevailing individualistic lifestyles.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41

This has been considered problematic because users are considered key to unlocking the full potential of the smart grid.

Eliciting little lack in knowledge or interest, users were able to articulate relevant smart grid enactments through a spectrum of skepticism, pragmatism and enthusiasm. Utilizing the concept of material publics[22], this paper argued that smart meters can bridge the green political economy of climate challenge issues with the user context of everyday energy consumption. The paper found evidence that user articulations, whether skeptical or enthusiastic, are rooted in political engagement as opposed to purely economic interest. This suggests a case for involving material publics in the smart grid and indicates that explanations for user disengagement can be found in active, subversive co-articulations among users rather than passive disinterest or a lack of knowledge. This paper suggests acknowledging smart grid users as politically engaged material publics.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"Over the last 10 years, the smart grid and heat pumps have increasingly gained attention in Denmark as an integral part of the low carbon transition of the energy system. The main reason being that the smart grid enables the integration of large amounts of intermittent wind energy into the electricity system via, among other things, intelligent interoperation with domestic heat pumps, which consume the ‘green’ electricity. Unfortunately, recent years’ sales of heat pumps have been disappointing. Several studies have investigated the ‘dissemination potential’ of heat pumps in Denmark, primarily through conventional market research approaches. However, there is clearly a lack of studies that take a more socio-technical approach to understanding how technologies such as the heat pump develop and how they come to have a place in society as a result of contingent, emergent and complex historical processes. This paper seeks to address this gap by exploring, firstly, the historical development of heat pumps in Denmark through an actor-network theory perspective and, secondly, by discussing the current challenges to a more widespread dissemination of heat pumps on the basis of this account.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"Currently, huge investments are being made in the electricity infrastructure in Europe. However, one third of the European grid investments are delayed, even though the majority of the population in Europe is in favour of a greener energy mix. This paradoxical situation is connected to the fact that although interdependent, the production and transportation sides of renewable energy sources are treated as two distinct processes. The two types of infrastructure undergo separate processes for development consent and are the target of opposition from various citizen groups. In this article we compare the British, Norwegian, and Swedish grid development regimes in order to analyse their opportunities and challenges. The comparison demonstrates that the regimes differ on significant aspects, e.g. different historical trajectories, technological setups, arguments, and main drivers. The article highlights the importance of achieving sustainable energy systems by relying on a sensible strategy for grid development, and the importance of moving beyond the focus on a sustainable, “green-fuelled” grid.","Volume 9, Pages 1-188 (September 2015)",September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/9/suppl/C,41
"Humankind is confronted with a “nuclear stewardship curse”, facing the prospect of needing to manage nuclear products over long time scales in the face of the short-time scales of human polities. I propose a super Apollo-type effort to rejuvenate the nuclear energy industry to overcome the current dead-end in which it finds itself, and by force, humankind has trapped itself in. I propose a paradigm shift from a low probability of incidents/accidents to a zero-accident technology and a genuine detoxification of the wastes. A 1% GDP investment over a decade in the main nuclear countries could boost economic growth with a focus on the real world, epitomised by nuclear physics/chemistry/engineering/economics with well defined targets. By investing vigorously to obtain scientific and technological breakthroughs, we can create the spring of a world economic rebound based on new ways of exploiting nuclear energy, both more safely and more durably.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"Energy policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change need public support to be successful. Deliberative democracy forums serve to both better inform the public of the available options and provide a way for policymakers to assess support for proposed policies. This work uses a pilot study in Pittsburgh to generate hypotheses regarding how a deliberative democracy process affects residents’ perceptions of and support for City-wide energy policies to address climate change. A convenience sample completed pre and post-surveys during a deliberative forum: “Building a Resilient Pittsburgh: Climate Challenges and Opportunities”. The surveys focused on knowledge, perceptions, and opinions related to the existence of climate change as well as energy policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Results suggest that the forum was useful in shifting perceptions, but did not significantly influence objective knowledge or policy support. Participants had a slight preference for energy efficiency strategies over renewable energy and public information. More research is needed to evaluate deliberative democracy approaches and expand these findings to a more diverse population.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"While energy research has examined behaviors and decision-making in residential settings, it has largely failed to study these behaviors within the commercial sector. It has also neglected investigating these dimensions from a group level of analysis. Yet groups influence behaviors like energy consumption in addition to individuals, and forms of such influence – like collective outcome efficacy or team cohesion – requires research at the group level. This review offers an overview of the area and tools to start this work, first by examining how three levers of behavior change in energy studies – cognitions, social structures and technologies – have mainly been studied from an individual level of analysis. Second, it reviews energy research in commercial environments and finds that only a small number of studies since 1980 have been undertaken with a group level focus. Given this gap, a typology of key group constructs and levels of analysis was developed and measures were reviewed that fit into this typology. This led to the identification of types of questions that can be asked in each of the technological, structural and cognitive energy areas with a group focus.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"This paper analyzes the moral aspects of household energy use and energy efficiency, and introduces the concept of the ethos of energy efficiency. Based on focus groups and domestication theory, it examines how consumers make sense of energy efficiency issues. Rather than focusing on economic concerns, focus group participants framed matters of energy consumption and energy efficiency in terms of moral considerations. Four partly conflicting moral positions were identified as being constitutive of the ethos of energy efficiency: saving, merit, needs, and entitlement. These moralities provided the focus group participants with arguments related to their decisions on energy consumption and efficiency. Arguments were made subject to moral calculations, through which the four moral positions were seen to moderate each other.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"A large-scale transition to low-carbon energy sources is necessary to mitigate climate change. In practice, however, when new energy projects are proposed in specific places and regions, their proponents often face public resistance. This paper is a synthesis of a multi-investigator study of community responses to new energy developments in four Canadian provinces. We identify three questions that communities are asking about the governance of these projects: (1) Are the decision-making and regulatory processes open, rigorous, and accountable? (2) Have local people been meaningfully engaged? (3) Are the costs and benefits fairly distributed? Overall, we argue that public resistance is often a legitimate response stemming from inadequate governance of energy development. Specifically, and partly because of the changing role of government in policy-making and regulation, local communities lose trust that governance reflects and will protect their social and ecological values. We conclude that innovation in community engagement is needed, particularly in the context of rapid institutional change and governments that might be unable or unwilling to oversee inclusive decision-making processes.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"Low-income households contend with high energy costs and poor thermal comfort due to poor structural conditions and energy inefficiencies in their homes. Energy efficiency upgrades can potentially reduce energy expenses and improve thermal comfort, while also addressing problematic issues in the home environment. The present mixed method pilot study explored the impacts of energy efficiency upgrades in 20 households in a low-income community in New York City. Surveys and interviews were administered to the heads of household in a variety of housing types. Interviews were also conducted with landlords of buildings that had recently undergone upgrades. Findings indicate that energy efficiency measures resulted in improved thermal comfort, enhanced health and safety and reduced energy costs. Participants reported largely positive experiences with the upgrades, resulting in direct and indirect benefits. However, results also indicate negative consequences associated with the upgrades and further illustrate that weatherization alone was insufficient to address all of the issues facing low-income households. Moreover, qualitative results revealed differing experiences of low-income renters compared to homeowners. Overall, energy efficiency upgrades are a promising intervention to mitigate the energy and structurally related challenges facing low-income households, but larger scale research is needed to capture the long-term implications of these upgrades.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"A transition towards low-carbon energy sources, such as wind, requires higher levels of public interaction; as such, the ultimate contribution of wind energy relies as much on technological advancements and policies as on societal sentiments. This study evaluates the influence of region, community involvement, and several IEA-recommended practices on social acceptance of wind energy projects among residents (n = 350) surveyed from cities in four OECD and three non-OECD countries. The results indicate interurban variations among the generally high levels of acceptance reported, especially among residents of cities in developing countries with lower domestic CO2 emissions. The level of community involvement in a hypothetical wind energy project had a positive effect on acceptance, and respondents from cities in countries with the highest installed wind capacity reported the greatest sensitivity towards involvement. Moreover, the results revealed that although the IEA-recommended practices collectively predicted acceptance across all cities, fair distribution of earnings and costs was the only significant individual predictor. These economic considerations, combined with increased community involvement, appear to be paramount to facilitating future development of wind energy. Through its broad geographical coverage, this research provides valuable groundwork for future cross-cultural studies on social acceptance of wind energy.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"Past energy development decisions can influence and constrain future choices, leading to a lock-in to a certain energy development path. As a large socio-technical system, such lock-in effects in an energy system extend beyond the techno-institutional environments to its human dimension. This paper represents an exploratory attempt to bridge the gap between individual and group level analyses of the human side of energy systems. A mix-methods study investigated how French engineering students view nuclear energy and why nuclear energy is perceived the way it is. Sixty-seven students participated in a survey and forty-three of them additionally took part in focus groups. Survey findings showed that participants not only strongly associated nuclear energy with specific imageries; they also exhibited a positive perceptual bias toward nuclear energy. Through focus group discussions, we identified six factors contributing to the observed positive nuclear perception namely historical development, education system, political environment, economy, media coverage and societal influences. These factors constitute sources of lock-in and represent barriers to societal support of energy developments that has relevance beyond France and nuclear energy. Implications of study findings for future research and energy decision-makers engaged in the task of changing a nation's energy system are discussed.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"As the significance of public opinion and practice for energy system change has become more widely understood, an expanding body of work is investigating drivers of social and public acceptance of a wide diversity of energy technologies, both infrastructure and end-user applications. The literature is large and spans multiple contexts, methods, theoretical and disciplinary perspectives and paradigms. While this diversity is in many ways healthy, experience suggests that it can be confusing for those without close knowledge of its constituent parts. Here we set out a framework for thinking about energy technology ‘acceptance’ that is relatively neutral in normative and theoretical terms, while acknowledging that a full integration of perspectives and complete theoretical neutrality are not possible. We do not claim a comprehensive review base, but draw on our experience to illustrate the diversity of what we regard as the more influential perspectives in the literature.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"Development of shale gas resources using hydraulic fracturing has dramatically increased U.S. gas production, but also created new needs for risk analysis and governance. Risk analysis for an emerging technology has traditionally relied on experts with knowledge of the technology and its anticipated impacts. But today it is accepted that input from non-expert interested and affected parties (IAPs) is also essential. We present a novel method to elicit concerns from IAPs about the development of shale gas resources. We used an Internet-based snowball sample to identify IAPs and an open-ended prompt to gather their concerns. Reported concerns included potential consequences for environmental, social, and health systems, as well as hazards, hazardous events, precursors to hazards, risk amplifiers, and issues concerning the effective and fair governance of the risks. Some concerns raised have not been addressed in expert-led analyses of shale gas risks. Long-term consequences such as disruptions to economic activities, and governance issues such as regulatory capacity, were more prominent in the responses than in expert analyses. These findings show how engagement with interested and affected parties can elucidate key issues for risk governance in shale gas development. The method can also be applied to other emerging energy development issues.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"Seawater air conditioning (SWAC) has the potential to reduce the energy demand for air conditioning by 75–90%. This article reports the findings of a mail survey sent to residents of the Hawaiian island of O‘ahu investigating attitudes toward SWAC and opinions of installing a system in Waikīkī. Results show that while only 55% of O‘ahu residents were previously aware of SWAC, 62% supported its development in Waikīkī and just 7% opposed. Of those familiar with the technology, support rose to 69%. However, when compared to eight other low-carbon energy options, SWAC ranked second to last. Concern exists about the potential environmental impacts of SWAC, particularly with regard to reef damage and algae production. Logistic regression analysis shows no significant difference in the likelihood of a person supporting SWAC due to their sex or level of education; although age, political affiliation, and locality do affect the likelihood of support. Those who see tourism as very important to Hawai‘i and think SWAC will benefit the tourism industry are more likely to support, along with those who have a very positive opinion of renewable energy, and those who are familiar with the technology. In contrast, high-income O‘ahu residents are less likely to support SWAC.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"High CO2 emissions, air pollution and fossil fuel consumption require an energy transition in the transportation sector. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) represent one way to achieve this. However, limited range is one of the major barriers to their widespread adoption. A BEV with a range extender (i.e., extended range electric vehicle, EREV) could be one sustainable solution to this problem. The present study examines the acceptance of EREVs relative to BEVs among a sample of early adopters. Specifically, we investigate whether indicators of mobility needs and acceptability of range extender usage predict individual differences in acceptance of EREVs versus BEVs. In total, 112 potential early adopters of EVs in Germany with previous limited-range mobility experience were surveyed. On average, both vehicle concepts were highly appreciated; however, BEVs were appreciated slightly more. EREVs with higher total range received higher valuation ratings, but only if there was no significant reduction in battery range. Yet, there were also substantial individual differences in acceptance of EREVs versus BEVs. These differences were related to certain indicators of mobility needs and the acceptability of range extender usage.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"The energy savings potential within non-domestic buildings from behaviour change initiatives is well known. Energy efficiency measures can contribute to local, national and EU policy commitments on carbon reduction. Yet, research also shows behaviour change is anything but simple. No-where is this more evident that in local government where municipalities are expected to lead on carbon reduction initiatives whilst operating in challenging political landscapes. This paper reflects on a UK Research Council funded case study exploring the role of engagement in a UK municipality. Innovative feedback tools and user-engagement were developed in an effort to foster a collaborative approach to energy management.Findings from an analysis of a focus group and a set of semi-structured interviews show encouraging signs with regard to increased user-engagement and digital tools, but barriers remain with regards to the ‘real world’ implementation of innovative, and technologically grounded, approaches. These included a staff reduction programme amidst financial cuts, a risk-averse culture with regard to new technologies, and debate about where responsibilities lie with regards to energy management. While these findings were case specific they have implications for organisations contemplating how technology might support them in workplace engagement for reduced energy use.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"This paper argues that those hoping to influence domestic heat management might engage more directly with the perceived cultural geography of seasonal adaptation. It draws on a study from a coastal city in southeast Australia where winters are mild and summers increasingly hot. We begin with recent qualitative studies of how households around the world live with winter cold and what they tell us about the varied cultural features standing in the way of any attempts at encouraging alternative approaches. Then we turn to our own mixed method study involving interviews, domestic warmth diaries and ambient temperature monitoring within respondent homes. Analysis starts with a common respondent belief about how those living in the locality would downplay the discomforts of winter cold because the cultural focus there was squarely on summer. Then the three homes with the most extreme internal temperature regimes are detailed to show how a diversity of domestic warming strategies were rationalised in relation to perceived norms of local winter indifference. This leads to a broader argument about harnessing narratives of apparently local adaptation.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"Programmable thermostats are generally sold as energy-saving devices controlling heating and cooling systems, but can lead to energy waste when not operated as designed by the manufacturers. We utilized Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing service, to investigate thermostat settings and behavior in households. We posted a survey and paid respondents to upload pictures of their thermostats to verify self-reported data. About 40% of programmable thermostat owners did not use programming features and 33% had programming features overridden. Respondents demonstrated numerous misconceptions about how thermostats control home energy use. Moreover, we found that 57% of households were occupied nearly all the time, limiting the potential energy savings. The study revealed flaws in self-reported data, when collected solely from traditional surveys, which raises concerns about the validity of current thermostat-related research using such data. “Ground truth” temperature data could now be available in homes with Internet-connected thermostats. Online crowdsourcing platforms emerge as valuable tools for collecting information that would be difficult or expensive to obtain through other means. Advantages over traditional surveys include low-cost, rapid design–implementation–result cycle, access to diverse population, use of multimedia. Crowdsourcing is more effective than alternative online tools due to easier recruitment process and respondents’ reputation system.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42

The study offers a comparative analysis of these companies from 1998 to 2013, outlining their development from thriving growth at the start of liberalization up to the current state of crisis. It identifies three strategic phases which the incumbents went through nearly synchronously and show how differences between their activities can be attributed to their respective power plant complex, regional positioning and shareholder structure.

"In France as in many European countries, grid-connected photovoltaics (PV) took off between 2008 and 2010, driven by an overly attractive feed-in tariff scheme that failed to take into account the rapid evolutions of PV technologies and markets. This unexpected expansion of a policy-dependent market led to a moratorium on feed-in tariffs followed by a consultation with stakeholders in 2010–2011. This article analyses the build-up, explosion and resolution of this crisis by focusing on the market and political effects of feed-in tariffs in the years 2008 to 2011. The consultation is analysed as an attempt at the political organisation and representation of the emerging PV sector. The paper shows that it failed to constitute a reliable representation of it, and that the government addressed the difficulty to control the sector by closing down both the market and the political space. It concludes that the good functioning of feed-in tariffs requires work of market organisation as much as of political construction, since their regulation relies on market data and on political compromises.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"Energy security has become a key priority in the European Union's (EU) policy. However, climate change mitigation commitments run in parallel. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the extent to which the EU's climate change mitigation and energy security policies are coherent. The relationship is far from clear-cut, as both areas are complex and wide-ranging. We use a simple assessment framework, which juxtaposes the main components of the two policy domains and characterizes the interactions between them. Our assessment shows that there is general coherence between several policy subfields, but a number of policy interactions require policy-makers’ attention. The coherence between energy security and climate mitigation policies will depend on ancillary policy measures and the evolution of external drivers, such as global gas markets. Furthermore, the future outlook of how the EU's energy policy will affect climate change mitigation and vice versa will depend on how the future energy security agenda is framed. A move to a nationally fragmented energy security frame would lead to greater policy conflicts, while a coordinated European energy security frame could increase policy coherence.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"Relationships between uranium companies and Traditional Owners traditionally have been characterised by conflict, negative impacts and the denial of rights, especially in Australia. It is estimated that 70 per cent of global uranium deposits are located on the traditional lands of First Peoples, while in Canada and Australia, the percentages are higher. Although opposition to uranium developments remains high, First Peoples increasingly are receptive to uranium developments on their lands. This paper explores engagement between uranium companies and Traditional Owners and identifies avenues to improve relationships. The Ranger uranium mine in Australia's Northern Territory is used as an empirical vehicle through which the following question is answered: can more mutually beneficial outcomes be achieved through greater attention to the rights of First Peoples and to the social and business risks precipitated by uranium developments? Based on the findings of the Ranger case study, the paper that risks and impacts can be reduced or ameliorated through greater emphasis on the rights of First Peoples and the risks to and from operations.

"The concept of social sustainability is discussed in a wide range of literatures, from urban planning to international development. Authors agree a notion of social sustainability is difficult to define, comprising numerous component parts (criteria), such as community cohesion, human wellbeing, effective dialogue and the access that citizens have to those that make important decisions on their behalf. The definition and measurement of these criteria and the role of social sustainability in energy decision making is a contentious issue. We argue that a community led, asset based approach is required to achieve any sense of how social sustainability can be defined in a community setting within the context of energy developments. We propose a conceptual framework based on a process of community group prioritization and visioning. Our earlier research on public participation and the role of dialogue for nuclear energy development in the UK, US and Japan is used to demonstrate barriers to be overcome if our systemic model of social sustainability is to become a reality. We highlight the importance of fairness and justice, place based approaches and socio-energy systems, concluding that these are necessary to promote a community and institutional awareness of social sustainability for large energy developments.",Volume 8,July 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/8/suppl/C,42
"The energy cultures framework was developed in 2009 to support interdisciplinary investigation into energy behaviour in New Zealand. In this paper, we discuss the framework in light of 5 years of empirical application and conceptual development. The concept of culture is helpful in seeking to better understand energy behaviour because it conveys how behaviours are embedded within the physical and social contexts of everyday life, and how they are both repetitive and heterogeneous. The framework suggests that the energy culture of a given subject (e.g. an individual, a household, a business, a sector) can be studied by examining the interrelationships between their norms, practices and material culture, and how these, in turn, are shaped by external influences. We discuss the key theoretical influences of the framework, and how the core concepts of the framework have evolved as we have applied them in different research situations. We then illustrate how we have applied the framework to a range of topics and sectors, and how it has been used to support interdisciplinary research, in identifying clusters of energy cultures, in examining energy cultures at different scales and in different sectors, and to inform policy development.",Volume 7,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/7/suppl/C,43
"Scenarios have become an influential tool in the process of energy system transitions, as they form a basis for, e.g., investment decisions or legislative frameworks. In this respect, researchers have recently focused on the technological viability of normative targets (e.g., emissions reduction). Beyond that sufficient condition, experience has shown that missing social acceptance may serve as a severe hurdle to the actual implication. Furthermore, the functional principles of the surrounding political system may prove inconsistent with the scenario's assumptions or implications. As a contribution to scenario methodology, this paper presents an analytic framework with a focus on the German energy transition. Accounting for transparency, social acceptance and political feasibility, future energy scenarios might be inclined to be more mindful of societal limitations. These hurdles may range from subjectively ascribed characteristics of the energy system to political veto-players. While the analytic framework is applied, it is not limited to the four recent energy scenarios published by German public actors. This study's results highlight the need for an advanced scenario construction process, which becomes eminent given that the emphasis is currently moving from if an energy transition is possible to how this goal can be achieved.",Volume 7,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/7/suppl/C,43

The paper is based on semi-structured focus group interviews with open-ended questions, allowing participants to express their spontaneous thoughts about GE. Although the focus group participants expressed great concern about climate change, GE was largely met with a sceptical, negative response. Participants perceived GE to: have negative environmental side-effects, address the symptoms rather than causes of climate change, create moral hazard and give rise to various governance challenges. Participants did not just reject the idea of GE outright; rather, social representations started to form in the focus groups through testing and negotiating arguments both pro and contra GE research and deployment.",Volume 7,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/7/suppl/C,43
"This paper contrasts two perspectives on energy efficient home renovations from applied behavioural research on energy efficiency and from sociological research on homes and domestic life. Applied behavioural research characterises drivers and barriers to cost-effective renovations, and identifies personal and contextual influences on homeowners’ renovation decisions. Research findings inform policies to promote energy efficiency by removing barriers or strengthening decision influences. Sociological research on domestic life points to limitations in this understanding of renovation decision making that emphasises houses but not homes, energy efficiency but not home improvements, the one-off but not the everyday, and renovations but not renovating. The paper proposes a situated approach in response to this critique. A situated approach retains a focus on renovation decision making, but conceptualises decisions as processes that emerge from the conditions of everyday domestic life and are subject to different levels of influence. This situated approach is tractable for energy efficiency policy while recognising the ultimate influences that explain why homeowners decide to renovate.",Volume 7,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/7/suppl/C,43

"Energy behaviours represent an important underexploited resource in the context of promoting end-use energy efficiency, namely in the residential sector. However, addressing the multidimensional nature of energy behaviours is a complex task and more effective behaviour change interventions and policies grounded on comprehensive approaches are required. An integrative intervention to explore the influence of usage energy behaviours on energy consumption was developed through an innovative combination of modelling techniques. A real-world case study was utilised to generate contextualised understanding. This intervention supported problem structuring methods as pertinent tools to be utilised in complex human-centred energy research, such as energy behaviours, by enabling the development of tailored methodologies which minimise the human bias. It further confirmed real-world behaviour change interventions should involve the different energy stakeholders and be designed to be flexible and adaptive. Results confirmed variables associated with different dimensions significantly impact energy consumption. In this case study the promotion of residential energy efficiency includes both structural and energy behavioural actions, namely a better insulation of the dwellings and encouraging specific usage energy behaviours. These results support the need to consider an integrative perspective when addressing energy behaviours and designing effective behavioural change interventions and energy efficiency policies.",Volume 7,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/7/suppl/C,43
"This study investigates how the larger social, cultural, and political context fosters and constrains citizens’ agency to take part in citizen participation schemes in renewable electricity production (RES-E). Based on a comprehensive review of research on gender and energy, hypotheses about gender differences in involvement in citizen participation schemes in RES-E are derived. These are tested statistically on the basis of data gathered in the context of a pilot study. The results reveal differences between women and men in the average ownership rate of citizen participation schemes, the average investment sum and decision-making bodies. In contrast, findings on gender differences in the amount of capital assets invested per capita are inconclusive. This study gives an indication that beyond individual preferences and investment attitudes, cultural, social and political factors also influence an individual's agency to participate in RES-E operated by citizens’ associations.",Volume 7,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/7/suppl/C,43
"Along with environmental impacts, renewable energy affects societal welfare through subsidy costs and electricity price changes. Identifying the distribution of both these impacts is of increasing importance as deployment grows. Subsidies are commonly financed by consumption-based Public Service Obligation (PSO) levies. We compare the distributional impact of different PSO levy structures using the example of a market with high and rising renewables penetration: Ireland. A flate-rate charge is more regressive than a unit-based charge. The regressive impacts of a fixed per-unit charge are greater for a subgroup of heavy electricity users, some with low incomes. Incremental Block Pricing (IBP) exaggerates these effects. A hybrid fixed/variable structure reduces regressivity for heavy users but lessens overall regressivity reduction. Redistributive mechanisms structured like Ireland's Household Benefits Package imperfectly target poorer households, with income and household size-based measures more effective. Including electricity price reductions due to renewables deployment, fixed per-unit charges have a neutral effect while flat charges redistribute some burden from rich to poor. IBP shifts cost to heavy electricity users, predominantly large households. IBP yields a negative net burden for most households across all income groups. These findings are generalised to inform equitable renewable energy subsidy mechanisms both in Ireland and elsewhere.",Volume 7,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/7/suppl/C,43
"Fuel poverty is a complex and pervasive policy problem, in part due to the difficulty of identifying households experiencing fuel poverty to target for remedial action. This paper explores the extent to which the use of prepayment metering for electricity can be used as a proxy for identifying fuel poor households. We hypothesised that as prepayment metering in New Zealand is typically used by low-income households, yet is a more expensive payment method; households using prepayment metering have constrained choices and are at higher risk of fuel poverty than the general population. To explore this question, we used information from multiphase mixed methods research on prepayment meter use, which included two postal surveys, complemented by data from an interview study, to explore three different methods of measuring fuel poverty. We conclude that as households using prepayment metering are experiencing greater levels of fuel poverty using all three measurements, prepayment metering can be used as a useful proxy for targeting remedial fuel poverty policy in New Zealand.",Volume 7,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/7/suppl/C,43
"Almost three quarters of all innovation projects disappoint or fail. Instead of ‘wasting’ human and financial resources on energy projects that end up being terminated or ineffectual, this study offers a potential antidote coined the ‘Origins of Failure in Energy Innovation’ (OFEI) model. Based on participant observation and empirical field research in three case companies, the OFEI model is developed to identify inappropriate behaviors that cause energy research and innovation to fail. The OFEI model can be used to give failed (or failing) projects a second chance and the article concludes that identifying and mitigating individual and collective misbehaviors are needed throughout the entire innovation process. If the level of ambition is not reached, then project owners should identify, analyze, and mitigate misfit(s) in their projects – and try again. For all intents and purposes, they need to fail forward.",Volume 7,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/7/suppl/C,43
"This paper addresses how fantasies of Jatropha impact research and innovation and how actors’ values shape Indonesia's biofuel trajectory. The paper develops an analytical framework that combines the concepts of technological fantasies and normative values. In other words, this study utilizes dimensions of fantasies to elaborate how heterogeneous actors became embroiled in Jatropha innovation. At the same time, the study investigates the presence of various normative values, such as faith in technocracy and beliefs regarding developmentalism, that emerged in and through actors’ multifarious involvement with biofuel. The analysis indicates that Jatropha innovation in Indonesia was intricately shaped by beliefs cutting across governance and governmentality, alienation and marginalization. The paper places these observations within the wider context of science and technology studies and, more particularly, within the issue of fantasy and innovation practices in energy technology adoption, use, and policy.",Volume 7,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/7/suppl/C,43
"Technical tools and techno-centric methods used for energy resource management and policy planning and development can miss important social and cultural factors. This can in turn result in a failure to recognize potential barriers and opportunities for energy and resource development in culturally diverse communities. Given the complexity of socio-technical energy systems, multidisciplinary analysis approaches are needed to ensure that modeling exercises more accurately represent real phenomena and outcomes of value. This paper describes the results of a public elicitation effort to gather information about stakeholder views and concerns related to energy development in the Navajo Nation, the largest American Indian group in the United States. Our results show that the potential for economic gain from energy resource development does not alleviate concern about environmental impacts, despite high poverty and unemployment on the reservation. Participants placed significant importance on environmental preservation, not only for the viability of future generations, but also for transmission of culture and identity that supports stewardship of the environment. Future work will use the results of this project to develop a survey that can be more broadly deployed across the Navajo Nation, and to develop a decision-support tool that links techno-economic energy models with socio-cultural attributes.",Volume 7,May 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/7/suppl/C,43
"Costs of external effects such as health impacts of energy production are not reflected in market prices and as a result are often not taken into account during strategic energy planning. Computationally efficient, reduced-form models that estimate the health impact of air pollution from fossil fuel fired electricity generation can reduce the time and resources needed to analyze policy alternatives. Such models are currently being used for preliminary screening, retrospective studies, as well as in comprehensive multi-pollutant economy-wide approaches. One challenge faced by energy planners concerned with lowering emissions, particularly those using integrated multi-model frameworks for analysis, lies in the trade-off between the uncertainty associated with reduced-form air quality models and the need for sophisticated photochemical modeling that can be prohibitively time and resource intensive.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44

"This article deals with solar energy policy and solar energy potential in Finland. Finland is one of the few countries in the EU that has taken hardly any direct subsidies into use for solar energy. At the same time, the transition to renewables is crucial in mitigating climate change. Finland's irradiation is almost the same as that of Germany, a country that is one of the top markets for photovoltaics in the world, also due to its successful support policy. Why does Finland not do likewise and adopt a support policy for solar energy to enforce its mix of renewables? What, if any, policy mechanisms would be needed to promote solar energy?The article provides an overview of supportive solar energy policy instruments in the EU countries, and an analysis of Finland's official energy strategies. The empirical part also consists of semi-structured interviews with different actors in the solar energy sector in Finland: politicians, corporations, entrepreneurs, industry representatives, public administrators and NGOs. The key finding is that the support measures envisaged depend on the vested interests of the actors involved. It would seem that some kind of support mechanism is required but the type of mechanism is of lesser significance.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44
"One of the most influential models explaining how and which (normative) factors influence environmental behaviour is the norm activation model (NAM). In support of the compatibility principle, research revealed that the NAM predicts behaviour best when all variables are measured on the same level of specificity. Yet, at the same time such approaches imply that the predictive power of the NAM would be limited, as behaviour-specific conceptualisations of the NAM variables only predict the behaviour being studied, but not other, related behaviours. We propose that it is important to understand if a general conceptualisation of the NAM, focussing on energy use in general, predicts a range of different energy savings behaviours. We indeed found that NAM variables that focus on energy use in general predict a range of different energy behaviours in different domains, including energy use in the house, for transport and for food, which reflect direct as well indirect energy use. Our results have important implications for policy makers who aim to promote a wide range of energy-saving behaviours needed to effectively combat climate change.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44
"This study examines the heterogeneous consumer preference for electricity products in the residential electricity retailing market. Based on consumers’ trade-off decision making, we identified three distinct consumer segments: the value seeking consumers (53%), the price sensitive consumers (25%), and the green consumers (22%). We concluded that consumers are willing to pay extra for the increasing share of renewable energy. Consumer socio-demographic characteristics had also influence on their choices for electricity products. The findings of this study can help explain how different consumer segment can be affected by the change of electricity product attributes. Thus, it provides insightful knowledge on how to differentiate electricity products so as to satisfy specific consumer segments’ needs. Finally, the findings of this study have implications for energy policy makers (regulators) on consumers’ preference for electricity products assuming that consumers should make a choice among various products.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44
"This study highlights gender-related factors and attempts to understand their influence in residential energy consumption. This pilot study was done in Bandung City, Indonesia. It employed a questionnaire survey and face to face interviews. Questionnaires were randomly distributed to the households in Bandung City. In this study, energy consumption included household uses of power for lighting, entertainment, thermal comfort and cooking. Energy consumption was estimated based upon electrical and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) consumption. The results showed that when the decisions about energy expenditure and control of energy consumption in the household were solely made by a woman, energy consumption tended to be the lowest. There are three possible ways decision can be made, by the wife, husband and a joint decision. This evidence suggests several things. They are that (1) women are good household energy managers, (2) men may be careless with respect to energy consumption, (3) women may be more cautious about household expenditures, and (4) when joint decisions were made the husband and wife relied-upon-each-other in reaching agreement. This suggests useful entry points for energy efficient initiatives.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44
"Over the past 30 years, the intensity of all major energy use categories has decreased in the residential market, with the exception of the miscellaneous electrical load (MEL). A significant percentage of the MEL is the energy consumed when appliances are in their standby mode. In the United States, standby power accounts for 4–12% of a typical home's total energy consumption. The whole-house switch (WHS) is an energy efficiency measure that reduces standby power by separating appliances from the home's line power through a network of wireless switches and receptacle-level disconnects. This study used a survey of over 12,000 respondents to estimate the energy savings that the WHS would have on a typical US home. The study found that the WHS would save the average household 282 kWh/year, or approximately 1.2–3.7% of their total energy usage. The plug loads of 24 test homes were monitored to validate the effectiveness of the WHS. The study found that the potential savings from the WHS were fairly modest when averaged over a large population; however, they could be substantial for householders away from the home during the day or with a heavy saturation of television peripherals, computers with peripherals, and kitchen equipment.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44
"Domestic energy demand is a topical policy issue, with implications for climate change, energy vulnerability and security. Domestic energy demand varies considerably by country, climate, building type, and even when these factors are the same, occupancy patterns and inhabitant's lifestyles also create variation. However, clarifying understanding of the basic locus of analysis: the home, house, dwelling, or household has received little attention to date, despite its relevance to debates on energy demand. This paper explores the theoretical and methodological assumptions of investigating the ‘house’ compared to the ‘home’ and the implications for domestic energy researchers. We suggest that the ontological priority given to the ‘home’ results in scholarship which considers both social and physical aspects that shape demand. Conversely, research prioritising the ‘house’ is dominated by techno-economic thinking, and overlooks critical social considerations. Recognising this important distinction, we conclude with a plea for scholars to be cognisant of ontology and language, and provide some suggestions for a future research agenda.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44
"Globally, about 20–30% of total energy demand is for residential use. Yet, our understanding of household energy consumption remains obscure. Due to methodological issues, conventional residential energy research has often failed to untangle the complexities of household energy use. In addition, theoretical deficiencies have led to underestimation of the complexities of households’ role (vs. buildings’ role) in residential energy use processes. This research hypothesizes that households have an indirect effect on energy use – through their housing choice behaviors – that can be untangled from buildings’ effect. Using data from the latest Residential Energy Consumption Survey, this paper develops a Structural Equation Model to estimate the direct, indirect, and total effects of household and housing characteristics on per-capita residential energy use in the U.S. Outcomes support the research hypothesis and recommend that, when incorporating the housing choice effect, households’ overall effect on energy use is larger than what has been perceived conventionally. Findings of this study provide a new approach to understanding residential energy use by highlighting the role of households and their housing choices in shaping residential energy consumption patterns. Policy makers can incorporate housing policy into energy policy and reduce residential energy consumption more effectively.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44
"Research on employees’ perspectives and decision making about energy conservation within organizational contexts is limited, constraining appropriate and effective policy and planning. In addition, work considering the socio-psychological influences of such organizational contexts on individual energy decisions is also limited. To help fill these gaps, this study used the Theory of Planned Behavior to develop a survey on attitudes, subjective norms and behavioral intentions toward energy conservation behavior among faculty, staff and graduate students working at a large U.S. university (n = 2919). Results showed the influence of subjective norms (injunctive and descriptive), attitudes, and perceived behavioral control on behavioral intentions to engage in energy conservation behaviors at work. Sense of community also positively predicted behavioral intentions and self-reported behavior. Theoretically, this calls for more work on how sense of community influences energy behaviors, while practically it suggests that energy conservation interventions should consider sense of community as a potential factor in program uptake.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44
"The transformation of energy systems is influencing economic policy agendas all over the world, particularly in industrialized countries. In this process, Germany has taken a pioneering role, and hence the technical innovations, legal frameworks, and business models established there are also of interest for other countries trying to achieve broader use of renewable energies. Energy cooperatives have been an important building block in the energy transition in Germany, although their practical importance is neither quantitatively nor qualitatively reflected in the academic literature. Drawing on recently collected data, this paper presents an overview of German energy cooperatives in terms of organization, financing, and membership. We then review literature from economics and the social sciences that has been used to analyze cooperatives on various levels in other fields. We discuss how these theories could be applied to create a better understanding of energy cooperatives, and we derive a preliminary research agenda for their analysis.

"The breakdown of the 300 year old Grotian regime of freedom of the seas and the subsequent rise in confusion as to acceptable claims for maritime waters is generally reported to date to somewhere towards the middle of the 20th century. It was also around this time that offshore oil developments made states look seriously to protecting their previously mostly ignored continental shelf. The problem looked to be intractable given the failure of the first UN Conference on the Law of the Sea to produce an answer to the question of acceptable territorial sea limits. In this paper, I look to see how the rise in utilization of maritime resources impacted the likelihood of international maritime conflict, focusing in particular on offshore oil and gas. Did the rise in exploitation of these resources (or the fear of such) impact the likelihood of conflict? I examine data on maritime conflicts from the 20th century in the Issue Correlates of War project to determine what, if any, effect the rise of the offshore drilling industry had on the development of maritime conflict.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44
"In the context of large-scale energy transitions, current approaches to energy policy have become too narrowly constrained around problems of electrons, fuel, and carbon, the technologies that provide them, and the cost of those technologies. Energy systems are deeply enmeshed in broad patterns of social, economic, and political life and organization, and significant changes to energy systems increasingly are accompanied by social, economic, and political shifts. Energy policy is therefore, in practice, a problem of socio-energy system design. In this article, we offer a definition of socio-energy systems, reconceptualize key questions in energy policy in terms of socio-energy systems change, analyze three case studies of energy policy development as problems of socio-energy systems design, and develop recommendations for rethinking energy policy and governance in the context of socio-energy systems transitions.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44
"Greater automation of air traffic control (ATC) could reduce aviation's climate change impacts, but improvements predicted long ago have been slow to happen. This resistance to ATC modernisation is framed as an issue of lock-in, and the detailed case study described here enables an analysis of the factors involved in slowing change. Although the classic lock-in effects of ‘increasing returns’ and ‘network externalities’ are important, a major barrier to modernisation is due to the political and organisational challenges of coordinating change across a large, complex socio-technical system. However, lock-in effects are crucial with respect to the perceived increasing returns accrued from experience with manual ATC operations, and the difficulty of quantifying the risks of automation (particularly as regard the use of complex software) is a major barrier to further improvements. Overcoming this obstacle to further automation depends on finding ways to test and operate new ATC software and procedures without compromising safety.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44
"Social resources are assumed to play an important role in the implementation of community renewable energy as a socio-technical system in Germany. The impact of social resources on the dynamics of community renewable energy has not been well understood until now. Given the importance of adapting to current and upcoming changes in the regulatory framework for renewable energy production, there is a need for a better understanding of the role of social resources in the process of sustaining community renewable energy production. Based on two case studies of bioenergy villages in the German Federal State of Brandenburg, we elucidate the nexus and impact of social capital, rules and cooperation in the development of community renewable energy. Promoting social capital that results in a balance between leadership and collective action, trust among all actors based on transparency, almost complete access to relevant information, involvement in social activities, and a consistent network of bonding and bridging ties, may contribute to the sustained development of community renewable energy.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44
"Recent quantitative and qualitative evidence documents a dramatic reduction in average direct UK household energy consumption in the last decade. The ‘fuel poverty gap’ in the UK (average shortfall that fuel poor households experience in affording their energy bills) has also grown substantially in that period. Here we draw on the literature on vulnerability and on recent qualitative interviews with fuel poor households to characterise the experience of energy vulnerability in the UK. Using our qualitative data, we explore energy vulnerability from the point of view of our interviewees. In doing so we identify six challenges to energy vulnerability for the fuel poor: quality of dwelling fabric, energy costs and supply issues, stability of household income, tenancy relations, social relations within the household and outside, and ill health. In analysing these challenges we find that the energy vulnerable have limited agency to reduce their own vulnerability. Further, current UK policy relating to fuel poverty does not take full account of these challenges. Any attempt to address energy vulnerability coherently in the future must engage with structural forces (policies, markets, and recognition) in order to increase household agency for change.",Volume 6,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/6/suppl/C,44

A qualitative case study of the relative inclusion in policies in Denmark, Germany, Finland, and Spain is presented. We found that the policies in Denmark and Germany are the most inclusive, then those in Spain, and those in Finland the least. The same countries have the most and the least developed niches.

I then discuss gaps in the literature followed by details on how the authors for the Special Issue collectively contribute to our understanding of renewable energy in Africa. I first note that most of the authors use qualitative methods, and then discuss key findings, including the importance of understanding culture, accommodating rural communities, fostering capacity-building, finding the money, and leveraging regionalism.

"Energy poverty has long been defined in Developing-Rural or Western-Urban contexts. For the parts of the world classified as energy-poor, the Developing-Rural context is used, but the population density of the energy poor is much higher in the urban areas of developing states and this trend is expected to continue over the next 30 years. Moreover, computations of energy use in developing states have been based on electricity use in industrialized states. Drawing on extensive qualitative and quantitative methods, and using field research in Nigeria, this article describes a context-specific way to compute actual energy consumption, with electricity as the proxy. It proposes a minimum energy poverty line of 3068 kWh/cap yr (350 W/cap), which is sufficient to provide for basic needs in an urban household. With the energy poverty line representing an energy-secure household, three scenarios were modeled for name-plate capacity generation based on data collected: low-consumer, high-consumer, and energy-secure households. These scenarios were compared to current generation capacity for select sub-Saharan West African countries. I found that these countries all produced insufficient power to supply all their citizenry, even if the entire populace were comprised of low-energy consumers. I found no relationship between actual household electricity consumption and electricity bills.","Volume 5, Pages 1-134 (January 2015)",January 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/5/suppl/C,45
"In this article, we explore the process of economic change following the NGO-led implementation of a small-scale off-grid hydropower system in Tanzania. We examine how the implementing actor deals with economic challenges and local ownership in order to achieve sustainable electricity supply. The qualitative case study shows that the NGO, ACRA-CCS, has overcome a number of constraints, which are sometimes associated with donor funding. This has been achieved by having multiple donors, an integrated approach and a longer presence. The ‘logic’ of implementation included active enhancement of productive electricity use, community services and benefits. As a result of these actions, the customer base grew quickly, rather than it taking many years to develop. The case illustrates the process whereby an off-grid system becomes economically viable. Local ownership has led to the project becoming an arena for community collaboration and problem solving, and creating values such as effective load management and protection of infrastructure. We suggest that attention should be given to possible public private community partnerships (PPCPs) – involving communities as crucial partners. The choice of a socio-technical system perspective was fruitful and provided crucial insights into how different factors manifested, interacted and played out in practice.","Volume 5, Pages 1-134 (January 2015)",January 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/5/suppl/C,45
"Village-level solar power supply represents a promising potential for access to electricity services. Increased knowledge is needed for the development of solutions that work for the users and are viable in the long run. This article analyzes a solar power model developed and tested through action research in collaboration between a community in Kenya and a team of social scientists and technical experts. The analysis includes the reasons for its socio-technical design, and the actual functioning of the model. The research shows that an energy center model can cover basic electricity needs in areas with dispersed settlement patterns, where mini-grid based systems as well as conventional grid extension meet significant challenges. Such areas are representative for large geographical areas in Africa. We show that portable lanterns and low prices may enhance access to suitable services. Committed follow-up of the local actors, and a flexible socio-technical design – allowing for improvements after implementation – contribute to economic sustainability and smooth functioning. Close attention to the socio-cultural context and the challenges of users, operators and managers is required.

"With diffusion theory as the point of departure, this study analyses the factors that influence the adoption of renewable electricity from individual households’ perspectives. The analysis is based on a case study provided by a Swedish energy service company operating in rural Uganda. The company distributes electricity to rural households via a mini-grid powered by a biomass gasification system. Three critical dimensions are identified to be crucial for adoption: technical, economic, and social. First, there is an emphasis on the relative advantages of the new technology. Second, there are economic requirements regarding a viable financial system for adopters, especially in such a low-income market. Third, the social dimension is critical, particularly the importance of foreign firms collaborating with local actors. We further suggest that a lack of understanding of local communities can lead foreign companies to fail in diffusion attempts. While we focus on Uganda, the results of our research are highly relevant for foreign actors who attempt to penetrate rural markets in developing countries in general.","Volume 5, Pages 1-134 (January 2015)",January 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/5/suppl/C,45
"Billions of people use traditional renewable energy (wood, charcoal and dung) to cook in and heat their homes. These traditional methods create serious health and environmental hazards, leading to renewed efforts to bring cleaner, more efficient stoves to people around the world but particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia where poverty is highest. Through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and voluntary markets, carbon finance is emerging as an attractive option to help scale-up cookstove projects. However, there is little understanding of how carbon-financed projects can help transform markets. This article begins to fill that gap by examining the role of carbon finance in cookstove projects in Kenya. Data was gathered through a review of project design documents for carbon-financed cookstove projects in Kenya and 26 interviews with stakeholders in the cookstove sector. Our analysis shows that carbon finance can help build a vibrant market for improved cookstoves by attracting international actors and technologies, helping establish standards for monitoring stoves and facilitating better follow-up and after-sales support. However, we highlight risks, such as potential mismatch between cheap and efficient technology and meeting user expectations and preferences. The study shows the need for further research on impact of carbon finance on improved cookstove project implementation across a broader range of contexts.","Volume 5, Pages 1-134 (January 2015)",January 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/5/suppl/C,45
"This short communication suggests the need to attend carefully to the social value of energy in designing projects to reduce energy poverty. We define the social value of energy in terms of the total value derived by an individual or community from the use of energy, including economic and other forms of value, less any risks or burdens that accompany energy production, transmission, and consumption. This simple definition enables two significant assessments. First, the social value of energy projects can be compared to their costs, to evaluate whether projects are worth investing in, even if they may appear uneconomic in narrower terms. This is especially significant in contexts such as off-grid or renewable energy projects that may have higher energy costs. Second, the socio-technical design of energy projects can be evaluated to determine whether the project will deliver the kinds of energy services, via appropriate strategies, that enhance social value.","Volume 5, Pages 1-134 (January 2015)",January 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/5/suppl/C,45

However, this cross-institutional comparison also highlights low- or no-cost capacity-building strategies that are being piloted within the four universities, including joint supervision policies, weekly seminar programmes, the establishment of specialist centres to engage stakeholders and the introduction of internal monitoring processes.

"In the context of the ‘decade for sustainable energy’ (2014–2024) under the UN's Sustainable Energy for All initiative, this article presents findings from primary research conducted into the ‘African Rural Energy Enterprise Development’ (AREED) programme. AREED was a donor-backed effort to support small and medium-sized energy enterprises, implemented in five countries by United Nations Environmental Programme between 2002 and 2012, as a means to expand access to sustainable energy products and services in sub-Saharan Africa. While access to affordable finance was found to be the primary constraint to establishing and expanding local small and medium-sized energy businesses, a range of significant non-financial constraints were also identified. This article provides a critical evaluation of these non-financial constraints as they were encountered in Ghana, Senegal, Tanzania and Zambia, based on the findings of a wider study into the key outcomes of the AREED project. These barriers include the institutional frameworks, human capacities and social and cultural factors.","Volume 5, Pages 1-134 (January 2015)",January 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/5/suppl/C,45
"In this article, the first comprehensive overview of the region's wind energy sector, we describe how sub-Saharan Africa's wind energy markets have evolved over the years, and the structural characteristics affecting the development of wind energy projects on the continent. We identify in the literature a number of social, political, economic and environmental issues affecting wind energy. Our analysis of the 94 wind projects in Africa, focusing on 38 projects located in sub-Saharan Africa, suggests that wind energy markets in Africa remain small, concentrated and nascent. We estimate that only 43 megawatts (MW) have been installed in sub-Saharan Africa at a cost of $122 million and projects worth $612 million are under construction to add 230 MW to the existing capacity. Seven of the eight completed wind energy projects in the region are pilot projects with the only project operating at a commercial scale being the Cabeolica wind farm in Cape Verde. We notice a shift from the use of concessional funding toward non-concessional funding and an increasing participation of the private sector to finance the projects. We also find that the public sector remains a key player in developing the wind energy sector in sub-Saharan Africa.","Volume 5, Pages 1-134 (January 2015)",January 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/5/suppl/C,45
"In 2010, the members of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) opened the ECOWAS Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE). In this first academic study of ECREEE, I use the diffusion theoretical framework to analyze the organization's founding, with a focus on the actors who created the organization. I find that three extra-regional states – Austria, Brazil, and Spain – are the key players behind the creation and support of ECREEE. The states supporting the organization all have self-identities as leaders in renewable energy as well as, in the case of Austria and Spain, long-term commitments to provide development aid to West Africa. Finally, a political entrepreneur with a long-term interest in sustainable energy and connections to the UN, private industry, and the Global Forum on Sustainable Energy, an NGO she founded, had a critical role in creating ECREEE. I summarize several initiatives before concluding with suggestions for further research on this topic, including using in-field research to learn more about the diffusion mechanisms and how African actors have shaped the institutions to meet goals that might differ from the extra-regional players.","Volume 5, Pages 1-134 (January 2015)",January 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/5/suppl/C,45

"Over the last decade, emerging economic powers have become increasingly influential actors in the formerly closed circle of donor countries. In the frame of south–south cooperation initiatives, large economies in the global south are working with less advanced developing countries. While a significant literature on China's role regarding mining and oil and gas exploration in Africa has developed, an analysis of the new dynamics of South–South cooperation and its effect on the political economy and sustainability of rural development and energy diversification in African countries is largely absent. As an effort to start filling this gap, we analyze the opportunities and frictions introduced by Brazilian actors in the biofuel sector in a set of sub-Saharan African countries. By assessing the political, technical and economic dimensions present in Brazil's south–south cooperation strategy for this region, we find that the arrival of Brazilian biofuel actors to Africa is leading to deep asymmetries between powerful and less preeminent actors, undermining the overall sustainability of the offered development model.","Volume 5, Pages 1-134 (January 2015)",January 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/5/suppl/C,45
"The Africa Clean Energy Corridor (ACEC) initiative aims to facilitate regional cooperation on promoting regional electricity trade and renewable deployment, allowing to harness tremendous renewable energy potential existing in East and Southern African sub-regions in a “Clean Energy Corridor (CEC)” stretching from Egypt to South Africa. In this short communication, we outline what role renewable energy combined with regional integration plays in meeting Africa's growing energy demand. Results compare an ACEC scenario, where regional cooperation promoting trade and renewable energy deployment would create favorable market conditions for solar and wind technologies, with a business-as-usual scenario where the region decides to deploy more fossil based power while using hydro resources mainly to meet domestic demand. We find both a decrease in overall system costs mainly due to the shift from high cost fossil fuel sources to a combination of further deployment of hydropower in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia, complemented by high quality wind potential in East Africa. This scenario would reduce carbon emissions by 40%, compared to a business-as-usual scenario where hydropower potential remains to be used only for domestic purposes. Our model showcases potential costs and benefits of combining regional integration with increased use of renewable energy.","Volume 5, Pages 1-134 (January 2015)",January 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/5/suppl/C,45
"Although one option for increasing low-income consumer knowledge regarding household energy use is the development of free or low-cost educational workshops, exactly how to promote attendance for such workshops remains an open question. Here we briefly outline results from a set of in-depth interviews with applicants to the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program in Durham County, NC, USA. Models predicting intended attendance at workshops or community meetings suggested that factors such as utility costs, social norms, perceived ability to plan ahead, and perceived accessibility of energy information all matter more than one's general attitude toward energy workshop attendance. Many respondents expressed interest in energy education materials and faced challenging utility costs, but meeting attendance appears to be constrained by the everyday life obstacles of the poor.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46
"This communication argues for the existence of a fundamental paradox related to Chinese energy and climate policy, made all the more discernible by trends in the electricity sector, urban development, and transportation. It first makes the case for the “browning” of China, identifying trends in electricity, pollution, and transportation that highlight the unsustainable nature of their present predicament. The second section, however, points to countervailing trends suggesting that China is also “greening,” becoming cleaner and less carbon intensive. The article concludes by noting that Chinese governance is excessively fragmented and that environmental sustainability may be incompatible with the accepted model of economic growth.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46
"Technical energy models operate within social systems and those that perform particular social as well as technical functions are more likely to be used. We illustrate this with the example of the MARKAL energy system model in the UK, a model that is also widely used internationally. In the UK, MARKAL modelling has a long history helping underpin government energy and climate policy. We trace the use of the model from its initial development in the mid-1970s to the present day, highlighting attributes that contribute to its role as a successful ‘boundary object’ for different but interconnecting energy policy communities. We suggest that changing images of the energy policy problem have enabled MARKAL to shift from an initial role in identifying technologies to reduce oil dependency to playing a key role in target-oriented climate policy. Furthermore, we argue that the ability of MARKAL to perform different roles for different groups has served to embed and institutionalise the model in the energy policy community. Moreover, the capacity of the model to represent detailed technology options has accorded with a technological focus that has suited prevailing, shared conceptions of the energy-climate policy problem.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46

"This study shows how stakeholders influence the development of community renewable energy (CRE) schemes and how they are influenced by their outcome. It relies on information collected during 41 structured interviews with local people involved in CRE initiatives in seven regions of Europe. The interviews were thematically analyzed to identify different types of stakeholder influence. The findings show that stakeholder influence on CRE schemes take place at three distinct levels: macro, intercommunity and intracommunity. In addition, key stakeholders can support or hinder the development of a project according to whether or not they perceive that the output of the project may benefit or harm them. The study contributes to the research on local renewable energy (RE) development by showing how stakeholders take on multiple roles and how their roles may change from process to outcome. Furthermore, the study reveals the importance of two stakeholder groups: intermediary organizations and local champions. These were groups whose positive influence was crucial in the implementation phase and for whom ad hoc policy could be established.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46
"This article explores the relationship between general attitudes toward wind energy, local acceptance of specific wind projects and respective intentions to act on those attitudes in Switzerland. Its primary instrument of data collection was a survey experiment with 919 citizens in five Swiss rural municipalities with potential wind sites. The survey presented descriptions of several potential wind projects. Participants rated their acceptance and intention to act for each wind project, as well as their general attitude toward wind energy. Results showed that general attitude is a strong predictor of local acceptance but is rated significantly higher than local acceptance. When matched with the effects of three procedural and distributive justice measures on local acceptance, the results of the study seem to support the concept of ‘Qualified Support’: local acceptance by participants with a moderate or positive general attitude is dependent on the associated local benefits, while local acceptance by participants with a negative attitude is not. Interestingly, the study also finds that general attitude and local acceptance both had only minimal effects on respective intentions to act. Thus, researchers should be aware of cognitive and behavioral aspects of local acceptance and seek to better distinguish between these two dimensions.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46
"Energy use is becoming an important environmental concern in China. Based on the theory of planned behavior, this study investigates how energy concern influences employees’ intentions to conserve energy at work through the mediation effects of attitudes, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and injunctive norms. This study sampled 564 employees of nine state-owned electric companies in China. Results of structural equation modeling indicate energy concern directly influenced attitudes, PBC and injunctive norms, but not behavioral intentions. In addition, injunctive norms and PBC have direct and positive effects on energy conservation intentions. However, attitudes toward energy saving were not related to behavioral intention. Importantly, injunctive norms and PBC fully mediated the effect of energy concern on energy conservation intentions and injunctive norms had the strongest direct effect on energy conservation intentions.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46
"Much effort has in recent years been directed to support sustainable indoor climate control strategies in historic buildings. In this paper we show the necessity to complement the dominant technical approaches with research that take a wider interest in specific contexts, social practices, and negotiated decisions. The objective of the paper is to illustrate how the interactions between perceptions and experiences of different professional groups are pivotal for the management of the indoor climate. An ethnographic study of decision making in an historic house museum was carried out in 2009 and 2012. Interviews were made with individuals who either took part in management or were affected by the indoor climate. The findings show how discussions among social actors and the way their respective priorities are negotiated are essential features of the management of the indoor climate and have a strong impact on the ability to modify it. It turns out that a hegemonic discourse about preservation as the dominant rationale for indoor climate control in tandem with “acceptable” conditions with respect to preservation have reinforced a state of stability. This explorative study opens up for a re-framing of how a more sustainable management of historic buildings can be achieved.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46
"It is widely recognised that the presence of some fossil fuels and their transport routes can affect the risk of conflicts. Other parts of the energy system and contextual conditions (social, economic or political factors) also matter for such conflicts, but which and how is not as well researched. This paper develops a framework that links characteristics of energy systems with contextual conditions that if combined increases the risk of conflict. The framework also provides a brief theoretical background as well as examples of previous energy conflicts.Examples of energy system characteristic that can affect the risk of conflicts include geographical concentration of primary resources, the number and diversity of exporters on the international energy market, vulnerability of infrastructure to attacks, vulnerability of users to disruptions and externalities related to interconnections with other systems. Contextual conditions include, among other, the rationale of actors to engage in conflict under various circumstances. The capacity of humans and societies to adapt to change should be analysed together with the characteristics of the energy system that place stress on actors. The framework can serve as a tool to identify ‘hotspots’ and, develop more robust energy policies and strategies to anticipate and prevent conflicts.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46
"This article correlates energy policy and practice with the multidimensional concept of energy security and empirical performance over forty years. Based on an analysis of 22 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development between 1970 and 2010, it concludes that many industrialized countries have made limited progress toward the goal of achieving secure, reliable and affordable supplies of energy while also transitioning to a low-carbon energy system. However, some national best practices exist, which are identified by examining the relative performance of four countries: the United Kingdom and Belgium (both with noteworthy improvements), and Sweden and France (both with limited improvements). The article concludes by offering implications for energy policy more broadly and by providing empirical evidence that our four dimensions (availability, affordability, energy efficiency, and environmental stewardship) envelop the key strategic components of energy security.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46
"A common European electricity market requires both market integration and transmission grid expansion, including cross-border interconnectors. Although the benefits of increased interconnectivity are widely acknowledged, expansion of interconnectors is often very slow. What are the reasons behind this “grid-lock”? To date, the issue remains discussed largely from the perspective of practitioners. Academic research on interconnectors comes mostly from the discipline of energy economics, offering models that do not necessarily help us explain the dynamic situation in the EU. This paper sketches the problem and its scale, reviews existing approaches and proposes a framework for analysis of interconnector projects, including a set of hypotheses that could account for the stall in interconnector development. The hypotheses relate to inadequate financing, diverging interests, governance and administration problems, as well as political discourses and perceptions. As empirical illustration we use the case of the German–Polish border. Drawing on document analysis and stakeholder interviews, we evaluate the hypotheses. Evidence suggests that at this stage, political and governance-related issues rather than economics and finances might explain the “grid-lock” we are facing. The concluding section sums up the findings, highlights methodological difficulties and gaps, and proposes directions for further social scientific research in this issue area.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46
"In the UK, air conditioning is becoming increasingly common in non-domestic buildings. From an energy and carbon perspective this is problematic. Identifying methods of preventing further reliance on air conditioning depends on understanding where and why it is being used. We draw on an analysis of the introduction of cooling in one complex case study site – a hospital in the north of the UK – to explore the processes of change involved. We find that the spread of air conditioning is an outcome of repeated moments at which multiple, situated forms of need become established. We argue that the various entry points in processes of building design, refurbishment, reuse and thermal system ‘repair’ are caught up in wider changes in the institutional context and working practices of the hospital. The use and reuse of internal space, increased reliance on heat emitting and heat sensitive technology and intense pressure to meet operational targets come together to create specific conjunctions in which air conditioning is seen to be necessary. These findings have implications beyond the case study setting. Limiting the spread of air conditioning requires multiple, customised strategies which differentiate between various forms of ‘need’, and a policy willingness to engage with the making of cooling demand.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46
"District heating (DH) systems may contribute to reducing the use of fossil fuels for heating purposes since they enable the use of waste heat and facilitate the use of renewable energy sources. This paper focuses on the transformation of the Swedish DH systems with regard to energy supply in 1960–2011. Swedish DH production was completely dependent on oil until the late 1970s, while today it is dominated by biomass and other renewable energy sources. The objectives of this paper are to describe and explain the fuel transition in the context of the main events that have characterized the development of the Swedish DH sector. For this purpose, we employ theories and approaches grounded in the literature on systems of innovations, especially the Multi-Level Perspective. The study shows that the transition involved a series of steps. Initiated by the oil crises in the 1970s the oil-based regime collapsed rapidly, while the growth of the biomass-based regime was a steered process governed by actors and supported only by external events. The lessons learned from the transition towards low-carbon and more sustainable DH systems in Sweden could be useful in the challenging task of steering future energy transitions in other countries and sectors.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46
"Households in fuel poverty are unable to heat their homes at reasonable cost. Energy efficiency programmes aim to tackle fuel poverty and should target resources towards households in greatest need. Households often do not have access to these kinds of schemes, as policies do not acknowledge the complex interaction between households, incomes and domestic energy efficiency, and the high level of variability which results. This paper explores this interaction at household level, and the diversity of fuel poverty which results amongst households in Northern Ireland, a region particularly prone to fuel poverty. Survey data (N = 1595) are used to generate pen portraits for 18 households in varying degrees of fuel poverty. Eligibility for free energy efficiency improvements is assessed and the impacts of tailored interventions on fuel poverty are predicted. The results reveal diversity amongst fuel poor households and, in many instances, households in most severe fuel poverty do not fit the criteria for energy efficiency upgrades, despite standing to benefit from significantly reduced fuel poverty. The impacts of retrofitting are greatest for those in greatest need, but even the most generous package would leave a considerable number of households in fuel poverty, for which additional policy measures are required.",Volume 4,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/4/suppl/C,46
"Renewable energy has experienced sluggish adoption rates among businesses and homeowners in both Arkansas and the United States. This study sought to determine the effect of adult experiential learning related to solar energy using an experimental design. Forty-one participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: (1) a group that experienced a lecture which was followed by a demonstration and (2) a group that experienced a demonstration first which was followed by a lecture. Participants’ knowledge of solar energy was assessed after the first learning experience and then again after the second learning experience. Results suggest that while lecture and demonstrations yielded similar scores on adult knowledge, learners that engaged in a lecture after a demonstration scored significantly higher than those that engaged in a demonstration after a lecture. Further, lecture after demonstration yielded a significant increase in learners’ mean score from before the lecture, while demonstration after lecture did not yield in a significant increase in learners’ mean score from before the demonstration.

"Physical and environmental scientists and policy-makers tend to have exaggerated expectations of what social science and social scientists ask for, what they can do, what policy relevance means in both the short and the long term, and what “short” and “long” mean in social science. There is also a tendency to misapprehend the crucial distinction between ad-hoc actors in the social realm, such as policy-makers and their advisors, journalists, experienced politicians, and policy critics, and professional and disciplinary social science. The former are licensed to make quick judgments on at best imperfect evidence. The latter cannot reasonably be expected to come up with anything ‘quickly’ on a new or unfamiliar problem for lack of an experiential data base.

"A pertinent issue in the literature on communication on emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) concerns the degree to which the public is actively involved in the communication process. While researchers have highlighted the pros and cons of limited versus extensive public engagement, the assumptions underlying various communication approaches have been largely neglected. Illuminating assumptions are important for scholarly understandings of what influences communication and for practitioner reflexive awareness in designing communication plans. This paper explores assumptions made about senders and receivers when involving the public to various degrees in CCS communication and how these assumptions relate to different communication objectives. We describe two contrasting communication approaches, the transmission and participatory approaches, relating them to CCS characteristics and research. We find that CCS communication may, deliberately or not, be based on different assumptions about the social framing of CCS concerning who should formulate the message, the public's ability to understand complex science, the public's interest in helping frame CCS, and whether public opinions should be taken into account. These assumptions also relate to different communication objectives – convincing the public or increasing dialogue – implying different communication fora, predictability, and input.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47
"The rapid development of distributed renewable energy systems and the pressures associated with increasingly variable energy demand in electricity industries worldwide have highlighted the importance of more efficiently managing temporal and locational supply and demand balance throughout the electricity network. At the same time, progress in a range of distributed energy storage technologies offers new opportunities to assist in this regard. This paper presents findings from a study investigating the potential applications for distributed energy storage (DES) in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). It first identifies and then provides estimates of the potential value of some key applications of DES in the NEM. These highlight particular opportunities in improving customer reliability and avoiding network expenditure. The paper then presents a framework developed to assess the extent to which the current institutional environment of the NEM enables, or constrains access to those applications. The findings suggest that a raft of institutional arrangements currently restrict access to DES applications and that aggregation and integration of DES benefits associated with these applications, across both spatial and temporal scales is particularly problematic.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47
"The provision of community benefits, payments to communities affected by renewable energy developments, has received significant policy-maker attention in recent years. This research explores whether the provision of community benefits associates with increased local support for a hypothetical, future offshore wind farm in Exmouth (UK), using an experimental methodology (n = 311). Participants were allocated to one of three framing conditions: (i) a ‘no-framed condition’, presenting basic information about a possible wind farm without mentioning community benefits; (ii) a ‘community benefit frame’, highlighting the likely community benefits that would accompany a wind farm; or (iii) a ‘dual framing’ condition, presenting information about community benefits alongside critical perspectives that commonly surround these (perceptions of ‘bribery’). Support for the development was greatest under the community benefit frame. However, this heightened support diminished in a context of social contestation (the dual framing condition). Elevated perceptions of collective rather than individual outcome favourability or procedural justice explained why support was greatest under the community benefit frame. Ensuring and communicating that community benefits offer a ‘good deal’ to communities, rather than focusing on individual benefits, may be the most viable avenue to increase support for renewable energy developments through community benefits.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47

We use detailed survey microdata to develop a nationally representative, heterogeneous agent population. We then calibrate our agent population to reflect the aggregate socioeconomic characteristics of a number of geographic areas of interest. Our data allow us to create agents with socioeconomic characteristics and environmental preferences. Agents are placed within social networks through which the diffusion process propagates. We find that even if overall adoption is relatively low, mild peer effects could result in large clusters of adopters forming in certain areas.

"As solar costs have declined PV systems have experienced considerable growth since 2003, especially in China, Japan, Germany, and the U.S. Thus, a more nuanced understanding of a particular public's attitudes toward utility-scale solar development, as it arrives in a market and region, is warranted and will likely be instructive for other areas in the world where this type of development will occur in the near future. Using data collected from a 2013 telephone survey (N = 594) from the six Southern Californian counties selected based on existing and proposed solar developments and available suitable land, we examine public attitudes toward solar energy and construction of large-scale solar facilities, testing whether attitudes toward such developments are the result of sense of place and attachment to place. Overall, we have mixed results. Place attachment and sense of place fail to produce significant effects except in terms of perceived positive benefits. That is, respondents interpret the change resulting from large-scale solar development in a positive way insofar as perceived positive economic impacts are positively related to support for nearby large-scale construction.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47
"To secure a sustainable energy development in the residential sector, attitudes and human behavior need to be modified toward more efficient and conscious energy usage. The goal of this research is to assess evaluations and to test the effectiveness in reducing domestic electricity consumption. The aim of the smart monitoring system we evaluate is to provide households with a user-friendly tool that improves awareness of energy behavior in homes, enabling better management via the visualization of consumption and persuasive tailored information on domestic electricity use. In our study, the system was tested on 31 Italian families selected among volunteers all over Italy, participating to the first trial phase from October 2012 to November 2013. A combination of persuasive communication strategies such as graphical real-time and historical feedback based on real data and comparison tools to encourage competitiveness against “similar” households were provided to users through a domestic user-friendly interface. In addition, personalized energy saving prompts were sent via web-newsletters to trial users. The study concludes that energy related persuasive communication is effective in reducing electricity consumption in dwellings on average −18% and up to −57%.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47
"Small modular reactors are the latest “new” technology that nuclear advocates tout as the game changer that will overcome previous economic failures of nuclear power. The debate over SMRs has been particularly intense because of the rapid failure of large “nuclear renaissance” reactors in market economies, the urgent need to address climate change, and the dramatic success of alternative, decentralized resources in lowering costs and increasing deployment. This paper assesses the prospects for SMR technology from three perspectives: the implications of the history of cost escalation in nuclear reactor construction for learning, economies of scale and other process that SMR advocates claim will lower cost; the challenges SMR technology faces in terms of high costs resulting from lost economies of scale, long lead time needed to develop a new design, the size of the task to create assembly lines for modular reactors and intense concern about safety; and the cost and other characteristics – e.g. scalability, speed to market, flexibility, etc. – of available alternatives compared SMR technology. The paper concludes that the decision of the major vendors (Westinghouse and B&W) to dramatically reduce SMR development efforts reflects the severe disadvantages that SMR technology faces in the next several decades.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47
"In the current market design, the increasing use of renewable energy sources for electricity generation leads to new challenges in balancing supply and demand. While households are responsible for 29% of total electricity demand in Europe, a good understanding of their consumption and load profiles is missing. Similar to existing clustering methodologies from marketing science, this paper proposes an approach for the segmentation of households. The approach particularly focusses on the impact of socio-demographic factors and the equipment with electric appliances as well as new technologies for electricity and heat supply on residential load profiles. In addition to these three factors themselves, the dependencies between them are identified as crucial. Therefore, in order to adequately assess the future development of residential load profiles, on the one hand, a qualitative analysis of socio-demographic factors is carried out and, on the other hand, the influence of selected technologies is quantitatively modeled. Beyond the mere impact on households’ annual energy demand, in focus of most existing research in the field, particular emphasis will be given to the peak load development, which is considered increasingly relevant for balancing supply and demand and maintaining security of supply.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47
"Whether or not targets to increase the share of renewable energy will eventually be met critically hinges upon the effectiveness of policies to mobilize private investment. However, just as energy policy can create opportunities, it can also create risk. This paper adds to a growing stream of literature at the intersection of energy research and social sciences that empirically investigates investor perceptions of regulatory risk, and their influence on investment decision-making. Based on choice experiments with 29 venture capital investors from Europe and the United States conducting 1064 investment decisions, we show that high levels of regulatory risk have a negative effect on the likelihood to invest in renewable energy. Furthermore, we find that investors’ worldviews moderate the impact of perceived regulatory risk: respondents who expose strongly individualistic “free-market” worldviews are less likely to invest in renewable energy ventures with high regulatory exposure than other investors.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47
"How will energy abundance affect U.S. policymakers’ willingness to underwrite the international energy system? This paper uses the correlates of support for energy independence in domestic U.S. oil policy to identify the marginal effect of oil import dependence in shaping the external behavior of the United States in relation to oil. An econometric study is carried out of an original panel dataset of votes on oil-related legislation in the U.S. Senate from 1992 to 2007. The paper finds that support for reducing the risk of oil import dependence is clustered around more unilateralist legislators who prefer to maximize freedom of action in U.S. foreign policy. By extension, this suggests the transformation of oil supply in North America to oil abundance is likely to have some effect on U.S. foreign policy, but this effect will be conditioned by the diversity of policymaker positions toward the importance of oil import dependence, and the variety of motivations driving policymaker support for intervention in oil markets. The findings are robust across a battery of different estimation strategies, including an instrumental variables approach using unique characteristics of the oil industry to control for potential problems with endogeneity.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47
"Although a large proportion of the Australian public express concern for the environment and support various ‘green’ initiatives, attitude-consistent behaviour is rarely observed. Rather, daily life illustrates that when pro-environmental action incurs personal risks, costs or losses, people often fail to behave in an environmentally friendly manner. One example of this divergence between self-reported attitudes and observed behaviour is the low subscription rate of Australian householders to low-emission ‘green’ electricity, which is typically perceived as more environmentally friendly but also more expensive than conventional ‘grey’ electricity. To identify some key factors underpinning this low subscription rate, a large national survey was conducted with over 900 Australian energy consumers who had not subscribed to the National GreenPower Programme. A quantitative analysis of qualitative data indicated that a range of self-reported reasons were significant barriers to subscription – including financial costs, limited knowledge, awareness and availability of green electricity programmes, and already engaging in other energy efficiency behaviour (e.g. renewable energy generation). Together, the results from this study suggest that currently low subscription rates may potentially be increased by improving public awareness and understanding of green electricity, alongside implementing behaviour change strategies and policies that harness principles from behavioural economics and social psychology.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47
"Smart homes will enable the new services and capabilities offered via smart grids and smart cities to be realized by householders. Yet, whilst there is a wealth of research on smart grids’ contribution to achieving Europe's ambitious climate change and energy policy goals, smart homes are not studied to the same extent. The aim of this paper is to illustrate differences and similarities in technical and economic drivers and barriers to smart home market development in three European countries characterized by different policy and socio-economic contexts. The research reveals key barriers to the adoption of smart homes such as reliability, data privacy, and costs of smart home technologies across the countries studied. On the other hand, housing stock characteristics, both age of buildings and tenure, reveal deeper cross-country differences in attitudes and perceptions towards these technologies. The research highlights the need for smart home services that go beyond energy consumption and management services. Only when such a holistic approach is adopted, where other applications such as health or security, suited to the householders’ needs and making positive contribution to their daily lives, are enabled, will the benefits of smart homes become clear to the consumer.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47
"This study examines the impact of the careful choice of the default on consumers’ participation in the Smart Grid. In an online experiment in three countries, participants (N = 3802) were randomly assigned to three conditions, two of which (opt-in vs. opt-out) implied different defaults and the third was “neutral” in terms of defaults (i.e., participants had to make an active choice). Next, the experiment was replicated in a field setting with homeowners having a heat pump (N = 140). An important finding from the field experiment is that in practice it may not be possible to force people to make an active choice. As expected, both studies find that an opt-out frame leads to a significantly higher participation rate than an opt-in frame. When participants are forced to make an active choice (neutral condition), the same level of participation as in the opt-out condition is found. This suggests that the two conditions are equally effective at overcoming the temptation to procrastinate and at stimulating a reasoned and deliberate choice process. Hence, when promoting Smart Grid technology to private households an opt-out framing is superior to an opt-in framing both in terms of effectiveness and stimulating a reasoned choice process.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47
"Earlier this year, we assessed the construction costs affiliated with 401 electricity infrastructure projects worldwide. We found that these projects collectively involved $820 billion worth of investment, and represented more than 325,000 MW of installed capacity and 8500 km of transmission lines. Taken together, these projects incurred $388 billion in cost overruns, equivalent to a mean cost escalation of $968 million per project, or a 66.3 percent overrun per project. In this article, we extend upon that earlier analysis to explain how hydroelectric dams, nuclear reactors, wind farms, solar facilities, fossil fueled thermal plants, and transmission lines pose distinct construction risks. We highlight that electricity infrastructure is prone to cost overrun issues almost independently of technology or location, that hydroelectric dams and nuclear reactors have the greatest amount and frequency of cost overruns, even when normalized to overrun per installed MW, and that solar and wind projects seem to present the least construction risk. Consequently, investors, electric utilities, public officials, and energy analysts need to rethink and reevaluate the methodologies they use to predict construction timetables and calculate budgets.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47
"This paper concentrates on ‘middles’ and ‘middle actors’ in energy systems and introduces a “middle-out” framework for examining and supporting systemic change to a lower carbon society. We propose this “middle-out” approach as a complement to “top-down” and “bottom-up” strategies. Our approach suggests that two essential elements for successful systemic change are actors’ agency and capacity, where ‘agency’ refers to actors’ abilities to make their own free choices, and ‘capacity’ refers to actors’ abilities to perform the choices they made. We argue that due to their position between top and bottom actors and between technology and implementation, middle actors play crucial functions in the transition process. Their abilities are based to their own agency and capacity which they can exercise to influence the agency and/or capacity of other actors. The paper discusses middle actors vis-à-vis ‘intermediaries’ and demonstrates the value of the middle-out approach. Through elaborated examples of three middle actors – congregations, building professionals, and commercial building communities – it shows how middles exert influence upstream (to top actors), downstream (to bottom actors) and sideways (to other middle actors) through mediating, enabling and aggregating both themselves and others. A few weaknesses of this approach are discussed as well.",Volume 3,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/3/suppl/C,47

"We conducted Internet surveys to evaluate Japanese attitudes toward nuclear power and energy-saving behavior after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster. In the first part of the paper, we examined the relationship between socioeconomic characteristics and acceptance of nuclear power in light of global warming. Like previous researchers, we found that nuclear power was supported more by males and those who have spent longer in education. However, nuclear power received less support from seniors. In the second part of the paper, we examined the relationship between electricity demand and acceptance of nuclear power. We find that opponents of nuclear power use electrical appliances less intensively at home and reduced their electricity use during the power shortage period after the nuclear accident. By contrast, supporters of nuclear power use electrical appliances more intensively and did not engage in energy-saving behavior. The elasticity of electricity demand explains attitudes toward nuclear power.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48

The data used in the analyses were collected in a general population survey from a random sample drawn from 21 counties located in the geological Central Core and Tier 1 of the Marcellus Shale region in Pennsylvania. Differences in the information reported by survey respondents living in high well-density counties (20 or more wells per 100 square miles) and their counterparts living in low well-density counties (fewer than 20 wells per 100 square miles) were examined. Substantive findings from the overall sample, as well as statistically significant differences between the two groups of respondents, are reported.

"Small modular reactors (SMRs) have been proposed as a possible way to address the social problems confronting nuclear power, including poor economics, the possibility of catastrophic accidents, radioactive waste production, and linkage to nuclear weapon proliferation. Several SMR designs, with diverse technical characteristics, are being developed around the world and are promoted as addressing one or more of these problems. This paper examines the basic features of different kinds of SMRs and shows why the technical characteristics of SMRs do not allow them to solve simultaneously all four of the problems identified with nuclear power today. It shows that the leading SMR designs under development involve choices and trade-offs between desired features. Focusing on a single challenge, for example cost reduction, might make other challenges more acute. The paper then briefly discusses other cultural and political factors that contribute to the widespread enthusiasm for these reactors, despite technical and historical reasons to doubt that the promises offered by SMR technology advocates will be actually realized.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48
"Geoengineering could counteract climate change by either altering the earth's global energy balance by reflecting sunlight or removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Geoengineering evokes various ethical and political challenges that are increasingly reflected in public debate and deliberation. Via a qualitative textual analysis of 1500 articles, we investigate discursive claims critical of geoengineering, considering what subjects are the most controversial, and what worldviews, values, and problematizations are shared by the actors subscribing to this discourse. We argue that the controversy about geoengineering differs, discursively, from other techno-political conflicts. Geoengineering proponents are described as reluctantly favouring research and deployment and displaying an unusual self-reflexivity, as they are well aware of and seriously consider all the technology's risks. Our analysis demonstrates that the discourse critical of geoengineering differs from and questions the dominant pro-geoengineering discourse in several profound ways with lasting implications for energy scholarship and analysis.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48
"This research explores the question, what motivates homeowners to adopt residential solar electric technology? Through interviews with 48 people across the state of Wisconsin, this paper examines the relative importance environmental motivations, economic considerations, and the demographic characteristics and network relations influencing the adoption and diffusion of innovations. This study suggests (1) environmental values alone are not enough, and are not always necessary, to motivate adoption; (2) rational economic calculation in the narrow sense of calculated return on investment or payback period is less important than the particular timing of economic events within a household; and (3) perceiving oneself as an early adopter is only important for some, while communication through social networks occurs in the context of communities of information. Further, these Wisconsin homeowners shared an unexpected characteristic that they identified as motivating adoption – an interest in technical innovation and enjoyment of the technical aspects of energy systems. The findings from this empirical case study offer general insight for understanding investment in renewable energy technologies at the residential scale, suggesting means of improving environmental and energy policy and highlighting avenues for future research.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48
"Smart grids are a key feature of future energy scenarios, with the overarching goal of better aligning energy generation and demand. The work presented here considers the role of the user in such systems, and the contexts in which such roles might emerge. The data used is drawn from focus groups with 72 participants, using novel scenario techniques to contextualise smart grid technologies in domestic settings. Two contrasting visions of the smart grid are presented, a centralised system based on current institutional arrangements, and an alternative system in which decentralisation of generation and control is pursued. Using the concepts of ‘energy consumer’ and ‘energy citizen’, the paper considers what forms of engagement are likely to be generated by the two visions. We propose that smart grid designs must look beyond simply the technology and recognise that a smart user who is actively engaged with energy is critical to much of what is proposed by demand side management. We conclude that the energy citizen holds out most promise in this regard. The implications of this for policy makers are discussed.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48
"Although energy behavior researchers have begun to realize that factual knowledge about energy does not always translate into specific household behaviors, many interventions continue to focus on educational strategies that assume individual knowledge to be a primary lever for change. We investigate the possibility that social interaction regarding energy may also play an important role. Specifically, we use nationally representative survey data (N = 816) in the United States to assess the extent to which an indicator of relevant social interaction in one's social network regarding energy tips and information is predictive of weatherization behavior over and above individual-level knowledge and household characteristics. Results support the notion that social interaction is predictive of weatherization over and above what we would expect based solely on energy knowledge and hold important implications for future work in this arena.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48
"With liberalization in 1998, numerous firms have entered the German retail electricity market, including newly formed consumer cooperatives. Based on Transaction Cost Economics, we develop a theoretical framework seeking to explain preferences for electricity supplied by cooperatives from a consumer perspective. Drawing on a convenience sample of 287 German electricity consumers and Choice Experiment data from an online survey, we estimate Willingness-to-Pay values for organizational attributes of electricity suppliers, while accounting for observed and unobserved heterogeneity. Consumers in the sample exhibit a large Willingness-to-Pay for renewable energy. Our results also indicate a substantial Willingness-to-Pay for transparent pricing, participation in decision making, and local suppliers. Democratic decision making – a distinct feature of cooperatives – exhibits positive Willingness-to-Pay values for approximately one fifth of the sample. Taken together, our findings suggest a slightly higher Willingness-to-Pay for electricity produced by cooperatives. Limitations of applied sampling and other important aspects of energy transition are also discussed.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48
"The turnover of the UK housing stock is such that CO2 emissions reduction targets will require extensive refurbishment of existing homes. Both within the literature and in practice, there is limited understanding of the interaction between housing energy efficiency refurbishment and occupant behaviour. The authors implemented interview-based qualitative research into energy-related behaviours before and after an energy efficiency refurbishment project on social housing in the north east of England. Half of the sample also received an information intervention. Template analysis identified seven key patterns affecting energy behaviour: access to knowledge and skills; nature of technical intervention; habit; external circumstances; quality of technical intervention; convenience of technology; and thermal comfort. These findings were discussed in relation to Social Practice Theory and competence, material and image as components of practice. The research provides an insight into the interaction between occupants and retrofit technologies in the context of a social housing retrofit. It is recommended that policy makers and implementers of retrofit programmes ensure that competence, material and image considerations are integral to retrofit programmes for energy use practice to change and more optimal CO2 emissions reduction achieved.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48
"People manage heat flows in their homes through diverse skilful engagements, including interactions with a wide range of materials that help to generate heat, move it around, or prevent its movement. Using these strategies, we try to ensure that heat is where it is needed, when it is needed, and can also try to minimise its wastage (heat-out-of place and heat-out-of-time). However, the practical knowledge or know-how used in managing these thermal flows has received little attention to date, despite its relevance to topical debates on energy consumption. This paper explores how experience-based know-how is used in monitoring and managing heat flows in the home. I also consider three processes that stimulate the development of new know-how: changes in the life-course, in material arrangements, and in shared understandings. These themes are illustrated using quotes from various sources, such as web forums and advice sites. Finally, I consider how these ideas relate to wider theories of experience and know-how, and offer some reflections on what this approach might mean for research, policy and practice on sustainable energy use.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48
"Energy consumption in the residential sector is one of the main parts of the total consumption in China, and demographic factors are the fundamental parameters affecting total energy use. Using residential energy consumption (REC) data from household surveys, demographic data from population censuses and macro-energy statistics, and the research assesses a theoretical model of the demographic sensitivity of REC in urban China. The method of population component is adopted to explore the demographic sensitivity on REC. Our research reveals different micro-demographic processes have different effects on REC, even when macro-demographic levels are identical or similar. Natural population change, urbanisation and aging are sensitive to REC. However, the population age structure is not sensitive to REC except for the 60+ age group. The scale effect plays a pivotal role in correlations between REC and demographic changes; decreasing per capita REC correlates with increasing family size. Because of the multiple sensitivities of population to REC, population size cannot be the exclusive demographic indicator with which to judge changes in REC. The effects of demographic structural factors surpass those of demographic quantitative factors. Finally, the findings of demographic sensitivity are used to simulate the scenarios of REC in 2015 under different assumed micro-demographic processes.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48
"This article examines the way hard and soft energy paths are discussed by policy makers, key informants and the press in Italy. Adopting a psycho-social and constructivist perspective, we explored what representations of energy and users, and what technologies are associated with centralised and decentralised energy systems. A large textual corpus was gathered from the online archives of the Chamber of Deputies, using as search criteria the Italian keywords energ* and/or sostenibil* [sustainab*] for the period 2009–2012. Selected corpora (N = 143 parliamentary debates and N = 841 newspaper articles) were submitted to content analysis. Results show that contents related to hard paths prevail over those typical of soft paths. However, while the contents expressed by the press fit with the hard/soft path dichotomy, political discourse is largely polyphasic and mixes elements of the two systems. These traces of incoherence suggest that energy transition is far from being completed and that sustainable energy is still a contended object of representation.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48

"As countries worldwide, and particularly in Europe, move to increase deployment of low carbon energy sources, significant investments in new transmission networks are planned. However, past cases of public opposition – both to power line siting and large-scale renewable energy projects – indicate the importance of understanding public beliefs and acceptance, and using such knowledge to inform policy making and planning. This study conducted a comparative analysis of public beliefs across three European countries (UK, Norway and Sweden) drawing on representative samples of adults in each context (total n = 5107). Findings show significant differences between countries, notably lower levels of acceptance and trust in the UK, but also similarities, for example that local residents are considered to have little involvement in planning- and decision-making processes. The results indicate two important principles: that acceptance can be empirically distinguished from support, and that general acceptance of energy projects is higher than local acceptance.

"Solar cooking can generally be described as a way to use the sun's energy for cooking. Despite its multiple benefits as a clean, modular, simple source of energy, the implementation of solar cookers is not as widespread as one would hope. In the literature it is argued that solar cookers are not adopted because they are often considered to be culturally disruptive. This paper shines a new light on the cultural dynamics of cooking by showcasing the social acceptance of solar cookers. Six cases are presented from two different countries, Burkina Faso and India where a particular type of solar cooker (Scheffler reflectors) was installed among bakeries, shea nut butter producers, and steam kitchens. These cases demonstrate how cultural factors can be adoption-enhancing or limiting in different contexts. In essence, the paper finds that solar cookers are successfully implemented where they conform to underlying cultural factors. The study concludes that by implementing solar cookers as part of an existing socio-cultural framework, solar cookers move away from an image of a mere foreign technology to an integrated part of the target society.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48
"The annual Earth Hour event is a coordinated, mass effort to reduce electricity consumption for 1 h. Earth Hour's objective is to call attention to environmentally sustainable action through the collective impact made when individuals, businesses, governments and communities voluntarily combine electricity conservation efforts. Earth Hour events have taken place worldwide since 2007. We compiled 274 measurements of observed changes in electricity demand caused by Earth Hour events in 10 countries, spanning six years. These events reduced electricity consumption an average of 4%, with a range of +2% (New Zealand) to −28% (Canada). While the goal of Earth Hour is not to achieve measurable electricity savings, the collective events illustrate how purposeful behavior can quantitatively affect regional electricity demand. Similar actions may be a useful demand-control strategy during temporary electricity shortfalls or other crises. The policy challenge is to convert these short-term events into longer-term actions, including sustained changes in behavior and investment. Other events cause coordinated change in electrical demand, such as television programs and sporting events. These sharp drops and peaks lead to inefficient generation requirements and, potentially, grid failure. These events demonstrate the importance of short-term behavior on energy demand and possible applications to energy policies.",Volume 2,June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/2/suppl/C,48
"Despite an increase of oil production from unconventional resources, concerns about the depletion of ‘cheap oil’ are more imminent than ever. Recognising the importance of media in influencing public opinion, risk perceptions and policy making, this research presents a framing analysis of peak oil in The Economists’ news magazine (2008 and 2012). One hundred and seventy articles, of which 58 focused on energy security and oil production, were analysed using content and discourse analysis. Coverage was multi-facetted, and included oil depletion as one storyline within the supply challenge frame, especially during times of very high oil prices. Oil prices and the rapid growth in ‘fracking’ were found to be critical discourse moments, influencing the nature of oil coverage in The Economist.

"Social science related disciplines, methods, concepts, and topics remain underutilized, and perhaps underappreciated, in contemporary energy studies research. To make this case, the article offers both quantitative and qualitative data.

"Much of the people-centered attention in current work on building energy use focuses on changing the behavior of individuals around a fixed set of things and energy services. This work envisions policy interventions for reducing energy use that rest on motivating people to act on potential monetary savings or to prioritize contributing to the global good. These perspectives largely omit consideration of higher scale and more intricate social contexts, professional cultures, and expectations that shape the activities, habits, and practices behind energy use. Below we discuss a notion of “social potential” that affords a broader possible contribution of social sciences to improved understanding of building energy use and how policies might reshape this use. We begin with an overview of the basic genres of research on people and building energy use and outlines three common missed understandings evident in the energy efficiency industry's attention to people: (1) “If only they knew”; (2) “If only they could be made to care”; and (3) “If only they stayed home.” Beyond individuals, communities, and organizations, we suggest social potential as a formulation that complements and transcends the technical and behavioral savings potential concepts underpinning much of today's building energy efficiency policies, programs, and research.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"This paper argues for the value of developing an integrated, trans-disciplinary science of human–energy interactions and suggests that Energy Research & Social Science can provide a space for further development of this science.

It considers the roles of these actors as energy consumers, as citizens who may influence the development and regulation of energy systems, as energy producers, as participants in organizations and institutions, and as parties affected by energy systems. The paper shows, in each case, that single disciplines rarely provide the depth of knowledge that is desirable for understanding or influencing individual and household interactions with energy systems and that integration of knowledge and insights from multiple disciplines is required.

"This paper lays out the relevance of the investigation of the underlying social dynamics and temporalities of energy demand for energy and social science research. Elements of a distinctive approach to researching the dynamics of energy demand are outlined, starting from the observation that demand is an outcome of what energy is for. Energy demand, it is argued, is a product of the vast array of interwoven social practices out of which the ordering of society is made. It is therefore necessary to understand how temporal patterns are already embedded in the social world in order to follow how energy use changes and varies over time. Three forms or categories of dynamic are discussed – change, rhythm and synchronicity – each providing a different way of approaching the relation between time, social practice and energy demand. In the course of discussion the increasing relevance of temporal patterning to both supply and demand-side policy and practice is made clear. In concluding further scope for a broadening of time-focused energy demand research is identified.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"Mainstream theories on household energy consumption are characterized by reductionist assumptions about consumers and the socio-material contexts of choice. Much of the social science attention on consumption has focused on mental states, meaning, cognition, and rational choice. In mainstream theory, body is collapsed into mind and the demand for goods is both disembodied and decontextualized from social and material worlds. These reductions hinder the development of a robust theory of consumption and new thinking in energy savings policy. In this paper we bring the body back to consumption. We argue that people's exposure to practices, both in the form of personal and culturally mediated experience, embodies knowledge (and meanings) and this in turn affects the ways we perform energy-consuming acts. We draw on work on body, habitus and perception by anthropologists Marcel Mauss, Pierre Bourdieu, Jean-Pierre Warnier, and philosopher Bergson, as well as more recent perspectives framed under the heading of social practice theory.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"Social science has a difficult position in energy research. In the past, social science was often misused to increase public acceptance of technological research achievements. The authentic role of social science, making contributions to how the energy system should be institutionalized, guided, and fitted in social and environmental contexts, has been dominated by one voice, that of mainstream economics. If social science wants to assume a broader more independent role, the many voices of social science have to position themselves such that governments, firms, social groups and individuals are able to profit from its various messages. This positioning requires a certain amount of self-reflection. In this paper, instead of theorizing, four research endeavors I have been involved in are set in their context. To this end I use a concept of transdisciplinarity proposed by Max-Neef. My hope is that authors of this new journal will join me in attempting to place their contributions in the context of a larger picture, so that their contributions can have an impact in guiding energy systems in constructive directions.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"The interdisciplinary nature of energy issues calls for a ‘big ideas’ approach to both energy teaching and research. To devise a suitable framework, it is necessary to develop simple narratives for relevant disciplines based on big ideas found therein, and to link them to other disciplines.This paper focuses on energy markets, their successes and failures, and outlines basic remedies for the latter. It suggests that the tension between market forces and market failures is not only a focal point of today's most pressing energy issues, but that it also provides a central geopolitical narrative of the 20th century. The importance of understanding energy policy logic within a broader political context, both domestic and global, is also emphasized.Finally, the paper illustrates, through examples, that the search for interconnections between energy economics and ideas in the sciences, humanities and other social sciences can only deepen our understanding.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"This paper addresses key implications in momentous current global energy choices – both for social science and for society. Energy can be over-used as a lens for viewing social processes. But it is nonetheless of profound importance. Understanding possible ‘sustainable energy’ transformations requires attention to many tricky issues in social theory: around agency and structure and the interplay of power, contingency and practice. These factors are as much shaping of the knowledges and normativities supposedly driving transformation, as they are shaped by them. So, ideas and hopes about possible pathways for change – as well as notions of ‘the transition’ itself – can be deeply constituted by incumbent interests. The paper addresses these dynamics by considering contending forms of transformation centring on renewable energy, nuclear power and climate geoengineering. Several challenges are identified for social science. These apply especially where there are aims to help enable more democratic exercise of social agency. They enjoin responsibilities to ‘open up’ (rather than ‘close down’), active political spaces for critical contention over alternative pathways. If due attention is to be given to marginalised interests, then a reflexive view must be taken of transformation. The paper ends with a series of concrete political lessons.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"Gender and identity should be core concerns for energy researchers and policymakers, because they mediate access to resources, exposure to pollutants, and opportunities to participate in energy resource management, policy, and science. Accordingly, this article suggests four research agendas ripe for further development: eliminating indoor air pollution, strengthening community resource management, developing feminist energy jurisprudence, and increasing women's representation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and energy fields. This article is a call to action to publish gender and identity research of great consequence in this new journal.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"Historical research can assist those analyzing contemporary energy systems or designing energy policies. While history does not directly repeat itself or offer powers of prediction, studies of the past can draw attention to frequently overlooked features of energy systems. Through a series of case studies, this article highlights historians’ efforts to identify the essential role of social and cultural considerations in shaping the successes and failures of energy regimes. In particular, energy researchers and policy makers can learn much from historians about the links between energy, culture, and society; the role of often-invisible infrastructures in limiting useful discussions about energy systems; and the need to reevaluate the traditional notion of energy transitions.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"Energy transitions are an unmistakable part of today's public discourse. Whether shaped by fuel price fluctuation, environmental and security concerns, aspects of technology change, or goals to improve energy access, attention regularly turns to ways in which to improve energy pathways. Yet what is understood about energy system change is still emerging. This article explores the evolving field of energy transitions with an aim to connect and enlarge the scholarship. Definitions and examples of energy transitions are discussed, together with core ideas on trade-offs, urgency, and innovation. Global developments in energy and related mega-trends are then reviewed to highlight areas of analytical significance. Key information sources and suppliers are examined next. The article concludes with ideas about opportunities for further research.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"If energy and society are parts of the same cloth, geography is the thread that ties them together. As a social science, geography has become more critical than ever to our understanding of how inhabitants of our planet interact and how the quest for energy is affecting economic and political stability everywhere. There is no avoiding the important interplay of energy, geography, and society. More, importantly, when we bring the three together it helps us better understand what we have created and what we will be facing. Despite its growing value, however, we have directed only periodic attention to the contributions of geography. Future research needs to consider the expansive concept of energy security as a place and context-specific condition. Energy externalities, spillovers, leakages, and free riders loom large as policy challenges with geographic dimensions. Understanding spatial variations in the link between affluence and pollution is important, because increased prosperity may eventually enable sustainable development. Facilitating the spatial diffusion of energy innovations and the process of technology learning are also key to solving energy/society problems. Finally, optimizing polycentrism as an approach to “scaling up” energy and climate policy would also benefit from geographic analysis.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"Providing societies with reliable energy services, fighting energy poverty and mitigating climate change entail a crucial infrastructure component. Both the energy access and the low carbon challenge require more decentralized energy solutions and a change in the energy infrastructure paradigm. Yet, physical energy infrastructure co-evolves with socio-economic institutions, actors and social norms. This may produce inertia against change. The energy challenge also requires solutions at multiple scales and may entail elements of common pool resource problems. Therefore, the governance of energy infrastructure needs to be polycentric. This allows for contextualization, experimentation and innovation. The article concludes by sketching routes of further research into the energy infrastructure governance nexus in social science research.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"Energy efficiency is an important approach to mitigating climate change, minimizing energy system costs and improving system reliability. There is a role for the social sciences in these sorts of efforts to reduce energy waste. However, a singularly narrow theoretical and policy model of energy use and energy savings governs energy efficiency activities in the United States (and, to some degree, in Europe), as conducted by regulated utility companies and state actors. Firmly established in recent decades, an energy efficiency industry (EEI) is guided by this narrow model, which supplies a unifying conceptual frame, analytic paradigm and discursive context. That model is not hospitable to the social sciences and is extremely limited from a climate action point of view. The partial perspectives offered tend to misdirect attention and hamper the best efforts. This paper considers, in some detail, the organizational and regulatory systems that have given rise to, and sustain, this framework. It also offers a social science research agenda that might allow society to move beyond conventional thinking and the limitations of ineffective climate policy that follow from EEI business as usual.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"The paper defines trust as believing that a person(s) or organization(s) can be relied upon to accomplish objectives because they are competent and possess values and intentions that are consistent with all or part of the public. Section 3 discusses public trust of specific professions and organizations, including the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, U.S. Department of Energy, and others in the energy field. Section 4 examines the importance of trust compared to risk perception and other drivers of public preferences. This section also shows that trust changes, almost always decreasing because of incidents and greater salience of negative information than positive information. It also considers the role of the media in amplifying mistrust, and it ends by considering the role of communications in building or reducing trust. Section 5 identifies six priority research topics. The two most important are case studies from Africa, Asia and South America, and more focus on non-nuclear energy sources, that is, coal, gas, and other forms, as well as waste management, and transportation processes.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"Climate science has provided ever more reliable data and models over the last 20–30 years, thereby indicating increasingly severe impacts in the coming decades and centuries. Nonetheless, public concern for climate change and the issue's perceived importance has been declining over the past few decades, thus giving less public support for ambitious climate policies. Conventional climate communication strategies have failed to resolve this “climate paradox.” This article reviews research on the psychology of the climate paradox, and rethinks new emerging strategies for how to resolve it in the coming decades.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"The debate over expert versus laypeople participation in risk analysis has deep theoretical roots. It also has practical implications, with both camps often attempting to assign the blame for shortcomings in risk analysis to the other side's faulty approach. A fairly recent concept in risk analysis, risk governance attempts to put the strengths of each camp into productive use by making them work together toward the same goal. Yet the legal and regulatory frameworks for implementation of the non-technical context of risk governance, as well as the underlying theoretical concepts, need development. This paper attempts to elaborate on the theoretical foundations of the debate and its practical applications, and propose an agenda for future research.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"Managing climate change will require massive innovation in the technological infrastructure for producing and using energy. Private market forces have driven the innovations that led to similar transitions in the past. However, because the value of mitigating the climate change is a public good, unaided private markets are not likely to produce the innovations needed to respond to a climate-driven transition. As a result, social sciences should play an important role in stimulating change in two ways. One is to influence consumer choice by other than price signals. The limited deployment of economically attractive energy efficiency technologies is an example of this need. The second role for social sciences is to ensure that governance institutions and polices provide a durable but adaptable framework for driving innovation during the long process of changing the energy system. Strategies for social sciences to engage with policy makers in these two areas are suggested.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"Energy is central to the survival and prosperity of human society, which explains the social sciences’ interest in energy production, consumption and distribution. The emergence of the global environmental agenda in the second half of the 20th century gave rise to a distinctive research literature on how energy systems and global environmental protection are interconnected. The threat of disruptive climate change, in particular, has thrown the spotlight on the central role that energy plays in shaping the future relationship between human society and its natural environment. This article provides an overview of how the study of global environmental politics (GEP) has shaped energy research in the past and how it contributes to defining the future energy research agenda. It provides a brief review of the emergence of GEP within the discipline of International Relations. It identifies three core conceptual lenses that are central to the GEP research agenda: (i) the study of environmental impacts and ecological limits; (ii) the notions of sustainability and sustainable development; and (iii) the concept of global environmental governance. The article then maps the emerging energy research agenda from a GEP perspective, focused on climate change as the predominant concern and framing of contemporary GEP scholarship.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"Oil politics is a major force in global and domestic politics, especially in developing countries. Oil income makes oil-producing “petrostates” vulnerable to the resource curse, the symptoms of which include pervasive corruption, wasted public spending, volatile economic growth, and more frequent civil wars and domestic conflict. Yet while common tendencies are observable among the group of petrostates, there are also important and systematic differences among them. States that are petro-revolutionary – having both oil income and a revolutionary leader – tend to instigate conflicts at a rate three and a half times that of a comparable “typical” state (one without oil or a revolutionary leader). Indeed, the tendency of petrostates to get into international conflicts cannot be explained without disaggregating the group. This research thus emphasizes the point that oil does not have a single, monolithic effect, but rather it interacts with domestic politics in a complex way.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"International political economy (IPE) is a multidisciplinary field which officially falls under the political science discipline in the United States. IPE of energy is a nascent field to which scholars have only recently started to identify. IPE scholarship generally focuses on issues where politics and economics intersect, and looks at a variety of actors, including individuals, states, and international organizations. Since IPE's official founding in the 1970s, following the energy crises and the end of the gold standard, most energy research has focused on issues related to oil, such as OPEC, the “resource curse,” oil companies, and wealthy countries’ domestic policies and politics as they relate to oil. We suggest a number of promising areas for research: on the theoretical side, making politics explicit and incorporating international organizations, global governance, regionalism, community interests, international structure, ideas and identity, and inter- and intra-disciplinary research. We also suggest three issue areas – renewable, nuclear, natural gas, and coal as energy sources; electricity; and sovereign wealth funds.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"There is a growing literature examining global energy governance that recognises the importance of actors, institutions, and processes in addressing diverse challenges including security, climate change and environmental sustainability. But there has been a more limited focus on the issue from the perspective of the poor. This omission is significant in view of the sheer scale of energy service deprivation – billions of people still lack access to modern energy services with consequences for economic development, health, education, environment, and gender equality. We briefly examine how elements of the issue of energy poverty are governed across different scales (global, regional, and local), and how effectively these energy governance systems are addressing the needs of the poor. Focusing primarily on sub-Saharan Africa – due to the pervasive energy governance challenges in the region – we consider the role for both governments and the international community in strengthening related tools, regulatory environments and institutions.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49
"The ecological impact of energy production and consumption is often relegated in analytical accounts of the evolution of energy systems, where production and consumption patterns are analysed as the interaction of social, economic and technological factors. Ecological and social–ecological dynamics are, we argue, critical in the context of imperatives for access to modern energy services that are inadequate for significant sections of the world's population. The ecological impacts of energy use are often analysed as a set of externalities, many of which are uncertain or unquantifiable, particularly if they stem from earth system change such as anthropogenic climate change. Here we outline the benefits from analysing energy systems as social–ecological systems. We review the extensive literature from ecology and resilience theories, and compare the analytical domains, major findings and emphasis of social–ecological systems with socio-technical transition research. We illustrate these differences with the example of the multi-scale impacts of biofuel expansion. We show that social–ecological systems research combines analysis of interactions with ecological systems and power relations between actors in energy systems, and has the potential to do so across production, distribution and consumption domains whilst illustrating the dynamics of such energy systems, identifying potential trade-offs and regime shifts.",Volume 1,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/vol/1/suppl/C,49

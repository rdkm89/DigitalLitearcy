"The paper investigates new opportunities for innovation and linkages associated to mining activities in Brazil, Chile and Peru. Three types of opportunities were researched: demand side, supply side and local specificities. The last source of opportunities is key for natural resource related activities. The evidence shows that an increasing demand is introducing important incentives for innovation and local suppliers. Nevertheless, a hierarchical value chain, dominated by few large firms, and poor linkages is blocking the diffusion of innovations and hindering suppliers’ development. The emergence of a group of highly innovative suppliers, which were identified in the three countries, is explained mostly by new technological and knowledge opportunities, which are not exploited by large incumbents and open spaces for new entrants. Local specificities are also key in the explanation of local suppliers. It remains a challenge however, how these, most of which were created to satisfy local needs, will move from local to global.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"Received theory of production is not very useful if we try to understand what the ‘sources’ of growth are when we deal with natural resource-based sectors of economic activity. In these industries, a complex set of interactions and co-evolution prevails between firms producing the commodity and leading the value chain, subcontractors supplying them with machinery, equipment, services and process engineering knowhow, public sector agencies monitoring their environmental impact and local communities engaged in the exploitation of the resource. These agents interact on a daily basis giving rise to a complex set of ‘sector specific’ rules of governance which vary from country to country and from sector to sector.In this paper we look at the mining industry, that has experienced a very rapid process of change due to the dramatic expansion of demand from China, India and other economies, and to major changes in the international knowledge frontier in many different scientific and technological disciplines (e.g. geology, biotechnologies, digital and computer sciences, health sciences and engineering). These developments have induced dramatic changes in the industry and most notably in the patterns of interaction among the various agents mentioned above. A similar process of sector-specific dynamic interdependencies seems to prevail in other natural resource based sectors, such as aquaculture, forestry products and others. In this paper we present a model of these interactions and sketch out an analytical view as to how production organization takes place in the mining sector, and how these location-specific forces induce change in the industry over time. Our way of looking at these issues has strong policy implications which we briefly examine in the final pages of the paper.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"This study examines how small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that are knowledge-intensive service firms (hereafter “knowledge-intensive service SMEs”) accumulate innovative technological capabilities through learning linkages with large mining companies and other industry stakeholders in the Brazilian mining industry. Drawing on detailed, long-term, qualitative micro-level evidence gathered from extensive fieldwork, we use frameworks that identify the levels of innovative capabilities and the underlying learning linkages to examine three types of innovative capability-building paths pursued by knowledge-intensive service SMEs: (i) building innovative capability from basic up to world-leading levels, followed by diversification into novel technological activities; (ii) world-leading capability building since firm's inception’ (being born innovative), following a sustenance of such capabilities, with a potential for diversification; and (iii) the movement of building basic to intermediate innovative capabilities with a potential to accumulate further capability levels and expand the firms’ customer base. Such innovative capability-building processes are more a result of individual entrepreneur impetuses than that of deliberate corporate or government policies. Decision-makers could utilise these experiences as inputs to design policies to fill this void and facilitate the spread of knowledge-based linkages and innovative activities in the Brazilian mining industry. Otherwise, a persistent absence of such policies could lead to a rapid reinforcement of the development of enclave features in this industry.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"Recent changes in the mining industry have opened new opportunities for technological upgrading by local suppliers in developing countries. This paper explores the factors that foster or hinder innovation in such a context. We employ a case study methodology to analyze a sample of Peruvian mining contractors that integrated into knowledge-intensive stages of the value chain in recent years. Our main findings reveal that technological efforts are largely driven by the mining companies’ demands, which favor incumbent over emergent suppliers due to their experience in the local market. In order to integrate into the more knowledge-intensive stages of the value chain, we identified that these firms followed two strategies: (i) identification of local-specific market niches where foreign competition is scarce, and (ii) partnerships with global suppliers and specialization in high-quality and customized complementary services. Still, all the suppliers in the sample are very new in technologically complex activities, and their innovations remain limited from a global perspective. Our findings suggest that this is partly due to a weak institutional setting, scarce support from external organizations, and limited coordination channels in the sector.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"The World Class Supplier Program, Programa de Proveedores de Clase Mundial, is a recent private sector initiative to strengthen innovation and collaboration between large firms and suppliers in the mining sector in Chile. The goal of the program is to develop innovations in domestic suppliers to provide technological solutions to specific problems detected by large firms and to sell them at a larger scale in international markets. This paper analyzes the evolution of this unique program and its prospects for the future. The program seems highly innovative and relevant as a tool for the development of suppliers but limited in size as to produce a substantial impact in the economy. Despite being successful in achieving its goals of creating technological solutions to large firms, the scaling up and internationalization effects of the program seem small. This is a result of the incentives facing large firms and providers. That is, while it is in the interest of large firms to collaborate with providers to develop solutions for their operations, they did not seem to have incentives to collaborate in the scaling-up and internationalization of providers.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"This paper explores the opportunities for innovation and diversification that can be opened in association to mining activities in developing countries. In particular, the paper focuses on Knowledge Intensive Mining Suppliers (KIMS) in Chile. Using case study methodology, results show that Chilean KIMS firms entered dynamic segments of the Chilean copper value chain either by customizing products and services to local productive specific conditions or by utilizing new technologies as a platform to develop unique solutions to unresolved mining problems. In the former case, Chilean KIMS are small to large firms with a family origin which entered consolidated markets dominated by large international supplies, whereas in the latter one these suppliers are small young firms which were created as scientific or corporate spin-offs that opened new market niches. Linkages with leading mining firms that governed the mining value chain have been crucial for Chilean KIMS to learn about industry needs. However, there is no evidence that indicates that these linkages have been significant in helping local suppliers to construe their technological and innovative capabilities. Instead, Chilean KIMS innovated in isolation and only occasionally received technological assistance from extra-industry organizations. Experimentation in mine sites is the most important bottleneck for Chilean KIMS´ innovation strategy. Governments seeking to support the expansion of KIMS need a good understanding of these companies’ innovation trajectory, competitive environment, threats, risks and opportunities.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"The extraction of non-renewable resources is broadly viewed as an unsustainable activity. After 60+ years of examining the role of non-renewable resource development in broader economic development, and its implications for economic welfare, there is little consensus on its effects–or even its desirability. This paper examines the issue of sustainability in the context of non-renewable mineral resources which, we argue, is entwined with the mineral extraction industry‘s “boom-bust” and “resource curse” images. We present a standard Solow-style economic growth model that integrates mineral endowment and uses the model to examine the mineral blessing or curse question empirically with a cross-section of countries. The model is tested using several econometric techniques that generally support the mineral blessing hypothesis. On the question of sustainability, we contrast the applicability of the concept in the contexts of renewable and non-renewable resource development. In the former case, the concept of sustainable yield is relatively straightforward. In the latter, the concept is much more difficult to apply. Sustainable development of non-renewable resources depends on factors beyond physical rates of production, such as governance and investment in human and physical capital.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
This paper examines the impact of oil shocks on precious metal returns using structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model proposed by Kilian and Park (2009). We capture variability in the effects through rolling window impulse response functions and by extending the dynamic connectedness approach of Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) using structural forecast error variance decomposition. We report time varying effect of disintegrated structural oil shocks on precious metal returns with a significant increase during the global financial crisis period of 2008–09. Our results also indicate that the aggregate demand shocks have most significant spillover effect on the precious metals except gold. We also report that oil specific demand shocks have highest impact on gold during the financial crisis and palladium having possible hedging opportunities against oil price movement. These findings have important investment implications for individual and institutional investors.,"Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"This study theoretically and empirically examines how resource prices are affected when firms in resource-importing countries acquire mineral resources. The study's theoretical examination considers a simple, two-period model that demonstrates how firms acquiring mineral resources may raise either present or future resource prices. This finding implies that resource consumption in either period may decline. Strategic behavior of resource-mining firms, demand for final goods, and extraction costs play key roles in this examination. Using a dynamic panel model with oil price data, the study's empirical portion estimates how acquiring resources affects the price of oil. Results demonstrate that prices in the present period rise, and prices in future periods decline.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"This study is the first to investigate the volume-volatility relationship for the five most actively traded industrial metal futures contracts of the London Metal Exchange (LME). Based on intraday data of 3-month futures on aluminum, copper, lead, nickel and zinc, it is found that both trading volume and trading frequency are highly relevant. The information content of these variables is not entirely overlapping, with volume being slightly more informative. The series of trading activity variables are decomposed into expected and unexpected components using a rolling window approach. Both anticipated and unanticipated developments appear to be significantly related to volatility. Positive shocks in trading volume and negative shocks in the trading frequency seem to be the dominant factors. Trading volume and number of transactions significantly affect both negative and positive realized semivariance, uncovering further asymmetric facets of the volatility-volume relationship.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"The development of linkages between multinational resource firms and their local upstream suppliers in engineering, technology and knowledge services is an opportunity for mining regions to avoid the resources curse and to satisfy sustainable industrial development goals. However, lead firms operate within the political-economic context of globalisation and financialisation, which affects their strategies and management practices and their contribution to the development of local supply chains in the resources sector. This paper explains how lead firms in the resources industry in Queensland, Australia are influenced by the agendas of global financial markets. These agendas drive metrics based procurement practices and a short-term focus in relations with local suppliers, which ultimately impedes the ability of supplier firms to penetrate global value chains and limits the broader economic development benefits of resource extraction.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"The commodity boom at the turn of the millennium spawned growing interest in development strategies based on natural resources. The Brazilian government introduced a groundbreaking contractual clause to force oil companies to invest into research and development (R&D) 1% of gross revenues from large oilfields, with the aim of fostering technological development. To analyze the impacts of the R&D clause, we conducted 73 in-depth interviews with key informants from the oil sector. We also carried out a survey of 156 project coordinators. Our findings suggest that the R&D clause has strengthened the contribution to technological development by the national oil company, meanwhile involving new actors. The R&D clause has also boosted scientific research, technological capabilities, and innovation. However, it had a minor impact on fostering the relations between oil companies and service companies, and technology-based firms have played only a minor role.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"After decades of development, China has become both the largest producer and the consumer of coal in the world. The coal mine output has continued to increase, and the production capacity is expanding at an unprecedented rate. However, this level of the output had been accompanied by poor geological mining conditions, low efficiency, high pollution, and high fatality rates. Thus, in order to have healthy development in the future, it is necessary to establish a safe, efficient, and sustainable coal industry in China. This paper examines four key conceptual dimensions for relative technological innovation of China's coal mine: research and development, resource exploitation, organizational management, and financial management. We established groups of indicators reflecting the performance of coal mine's technological innovation activities in each dimension. After reviewing major approaches to increase capacity for innovation, we developed an index system based on Data Envelopment Analysis(DEA) to audit the progress of innovation and development. We performed a case study of twenty certified green coal mines, the result demonstrates that this index system and model can effectively evaluate coal mine's relative technological innovation capability and get the input gap towards safety, efficiency and sustainability.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"A modified version of the Cobb-Douglas production function is proposed for simulating production costs in resource extraction models. The resulting average cost function is U-shaped with a wide bottom, and as such should be more representative of the economies of scale associated with bulk operations. It also possesses a minimum which is obtainable from the characteristics of the operations. The viability of the proposed cost function is demonstrated in a profit maximisation exercise constructed as a problem in optimal control, rendering results consistent with what could be seen in a real-world resource extraction operation with similar constraints.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"Resource-for-infrastructure (RFI) deals generate upfront infrastructure investments that are to be repaid via future resource extraction revenues. However, much can change in the meantime. This paper explores the Democratic Republic of Congo's Sicomines agreement, a critical RFI case that has proven to be highly contentious, and highlights the role played by risk from its inception a decade ago until now. Drawing on the Sicomines agreement, this paper employs financial modeling techniques to highlight the pitfalls of attempting to identify winners in RFI deals before they reach their conclusion. As this paper demonstrates, the expected benefits of RFI deals can change swiftly and unpredictably. In fact, the model presented in this paper estimates that Sicomines’ NPV has dropped from USD 10 billion to minus USD 150 million since its inception.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"According to a rent-seeking approach to corruption, resource-rich countries are more vulnerable to rent-seeking behavior than resource-poor countries. However, not all resource-rich countries experience widespread corruption. To help explain this puzzle, I propose that the relationship between natural resources (e.g. the depletion of minerals) and corruption is dependent on the composition of the selectorate (through diverse levels of economic development) and the variation of political systems (democracies vs. autocracies). The large-N empirical analysis finds support for the hypotheses: on average, poor, autocratic, resource-rich countries suffer from more corruption than rich, democratic, resource-rich countries. This research contributes to the discussion of resource curses and blessings by suggesting that a closer inspection of a country's political and economic conditions is required to understand the causal link between natural resource wealth and corruption. Whereas the empirical analysis particularly focuses on the validity of the argument for mineral resource wealth and corruption, the overall theoretical and empirical scope of this paper is intentionally broader in nature: The paper also contributes to our collective research understanding of various forms of resource wealth (i.e. mineral depletion, fuel exports, oil wealth or energy depletion) and corruption.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"Embodied resource accounting and flow tracking are drawing increasing attention in the economy and environment issues. Differing from previous studies, this paper focus on embodied minerals, including non-metallic minerals and metals. This article proposes a systemic framework to estimate the global embodied mineral flows between sectors using multi-regional input-output analysis. Then, a global embodied mineral flow network is established, based on complex network theory, to explore the structure characteristics of embodied mineral flows. The results firstly show there is significant small-world property in the global embodied mineral flow network. Most sectors can have indirect connection with other sectors via a few sectors. Secondly, the network topology shows that a few important sectors play different roles. For example, Other Non-Metallic Mineral in China is the most important consumer of embodied minerals. The sectors’ roles can be used to find the key points in the global embodied mineral flows. Thirdly, the results indicate that the embodied mineral flows have strong directionality. It includes: (1) Embodied minerals mainly flows within countries. China, the USA and India are important embodied mineral consumers. (2) Embodied mineral flows commonly follow fixed connections between sectors, such as Construction→ Other Non-Metallic Mineral, which helps locate the target of resource adjusting. Finally, the policy implications for different countries are proposed.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"The diversity of supply, or conversely its concentration, has become one of the key factors in measuring the criticality of minerals. The premise is that if supply is limited to just a few major suppliers the risk of supply disruption is increased, although in reality it depends on many more factors that can be complicated to measure. In addition, there is a wide range of possible methods for measuring supply diversity or concentration, some involving the use of complicated formulas, which can easily become bewildering to the non-statistician. Often the intricacies of their use, the data inputs and sources, and the resulting indices, are not fully understood with the consequent risk of misinformed decisions being based upon them. This paper examines a selection of the available indicators, discusses their limitations and illustrates how a simple index, such as concentration ratio, can be as informative as more complicated approaches. Further, it uses the trends in supply diversity for five minerals (fluorspar, lithium, coal, copper and nickel), taken at decadal intervals over the past century, to demonstrate that a snapshot index taken at a single point in time does not accurately determine whether the level of supply concentration is a cause for concern.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"Nowadays, the metal industry has become an important source of China's energy consumption and environmental pollution. With the tightening of resources and environmental constraints and the calls for green development, transforming the development mode and improving green total-factor productivity (TFP) of China's metal industry become the only way to help China get out of the dual dilemmas of resources depletion and environmental degradation. By applying a meta-frontier approach, this paper investigates the sources of green TFP changes and its inefficiency of China's metal industry during 2000–2015, from regional and provincial perspectives. The results show that: (1) green TFP in China's metal industry increased by 11.52% annually. Technological progress is the most critical driving factor and the reduction of regional technology gap plays a certain role in promoting green TFP growth, while declines in scale efficiency and pure technical efficiency are two inhibitors; (2) the current green TFP of China's metal industry is relatively low and green TFP inefficiency mainly comes from three aspects, i.e., technology gap, scale inefficiency, and pure technical inefficiency; (3) Because the sources of green TFP inefficiency in metal industry and the potential for green TFP gains show distinct spatial characteristics, this paper takes a further step to formulate specific strategies for metal industries in each of China's provinces to improve their green TFPs, from three aspects of bridging the technology gap, adjusting industrial scale, and upgrading management level.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"For the past two decades, Zimbabwe has experienced a pervasive economic collapse. Most of the challenges were caused by policy inconsistencies, bad policy choices, economic mismanagement and political instability. This led to deindustrialization with a sharp decline in manufacturing and agriculture productivity and output, which consequently caused a sharp increase in unemployment and poverty.Although it is not fully developed, the mining industry in Zimbabwe presents an opportunity for economic stimulation that may lead to economic recovery, but requires broad-based economic reforms. This paper presents the findings of a review, and benchmarking of Zimbabwe's policies, which affect mining investment, inclusive economic growth and human development. The policies were benchmarked and compared to similar policies of Botswana, Namibia and South Africa using the Natural Resources Benchmarking Charter Framework. The outcomes of the review and benchmarking process were taken into consideration when coming up with policy suggestions that are meant to economically transform Zimbabwe, which at the same time brings sustained human development.

"Globally, land has significant socio-economic value since it is a major source of livelihood for people who use it for farming. Yet, mineral mining is reducing people's access to their land. This paper employs the global land grabbing literature to examine the political economy of land dispossession in Ghana's mining sector, with a focus on the activities of two multinational companies. The argument is that is that the dispossession that occurs due to the proliferation of mineral extraction undermines the potential contribution of mining to sustainable livelihood outcomes for people in host communities. To augment this argument, the paper draws upon primary data gathered using two methods namely, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions in addition to a plethora of secondary sources, on the community perspectives on dispossession and marginalization relative to land and livelihoods in Ghana's mining sector. Drawing upon such data, the paper also underscores the intersections of place (global and local) and agency (domestic and foreign) with the overall objective of using the case of Ghana to underscore how land dispossession remains an important driver of social injustice, marginalization, and poor livelihoods in mining communities.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"Timor Leste which emerged as a sovereign nation in 2002, is one of the most oil dependent countries in the world but with limited oil reserves. In 2005 it set up a Petroleum Fund to provide a stable source of revenues for the budget over the long term and to preserve intergenerational equity. Ten years later, the petroleum fund balance fell for the first time due to falling output, lower oil prices and lower returns on investment. With its oil production expected to cease in 2023 and withdrawals from the fund far exceeding the estimated sustainable income level it is imperative that revenues are spent wisely. This study focuses on examining the pattern of oil revenue expenditures and concludes that expenditures on veterans' payments and large scale infrastructure projects have thwarted the stated aims of the fund particularly that of preserving intergenerational equity.

"The number of science publications is growing exponentially, thus increasing the need for understanding the knowledge base of various research streams and their emerging branches. From a social science perspective, the literature on the mining sector – the industrial sector that extracts ores and minerals from the ground – has also witnessed steady growth. However, this literature is rather fragmented in regards to the thematic topics and the geographical focus. To respond to this, this paper offers a systematic literature review of the social science research on the mining sector. The publication database of this review includes a set of 483 systemically selected papers from 976 authors, covering empirical research conducted in 73 countries from 5 continents: Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia and America. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we provide an analysis of the geography of the research in terms of both authorship and empirical focus. In terms of the geographical coverage of the empirical cases, Australia appears as the most studied country in the field, followed by countries in other regions such as Asia (China, India, Russia and Turkey), Africa (Ghana, South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), North America (the USA and Canada), Latin America (Brazil and Chile) and Europe (Poland, Spain and Sweden). However, this dispersion is not reflected in the geographical coverage of the affiliations of the authors. Secondly, we identify the most popular social science research topics on the mining sector. Our results show that the social science research on the mining sector shifted from the traditional research streams (e.g., industrialisation and growth, colonialization, technological and economic development, and the resource curse) to the new streams of research on social, environmental and economical sustainability (e.g., the social license to operate, corporate social responsibility, criticality of the rare earth elements, material flow analysis and environmental impacts). Overall, our study serves as an entry point for researches who are interested in social science research on the mining sector.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"The paper builds a dynamic computable general equilibrium model (Dynamic CGE Model) to evaluate the impact on carbon emissions reduction and haze with different scenarios of coal resource tax rate adjustment. The results shows that: Overall speaking, coal resource tax reform can be conducive to promote CO2 emission reduction and environmental benefits from a longer time rang, but the impacts are different with the three kinds of policy design which are 2%,5% and 10% respectively. Increased coal resources tax inhibits resources consumption, improves resource utilization efficiency, and reduces haze emission; meanwhile, the implementation of resource value compensation policy plays a more positive role in improving the environment quality. Compared with the impact by 2% and 10% tax rate, 5% Ad valorem tax should be a reasonable and effective choice for decreasing CO2 emission and PM2.5&PM10, and improving environment welfare. Therefore, some suggestions are given as following: 1) it is necessary to choose coal resource tax rate properly and scientifically. 2) Integrating the policy of resource compensation into the category of resource tax, and further clarify the form of resource compensation standards. 3) Paying more attention to the coordination of resources policy; 4) important mineral resources, forest resources should be incorporated into the resource tax policy.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"In this article we examine whether foreign aid and natural resources can act as a double curse on developing countries with poor governance. We hypothesize that affording external liquidity to dictators based on their resource wealth reduces the political incentives for long term investment and enhances the looting of the country and more frequent irregular exit of leaders from their office. We then examine the empirical evidence for such a link between international aid flows and government irregular turnover in resource-rich countries. We find that the interaction between natural resources and most forms of international aid combines with political instability in the case of non-democratic regimes. In turn, this combination of foreign aid, natural resources and political instability is associated with lower growth performance. Some types of less fungible aid (notably humanitarian) and aid grants that do not build indebtedness do not seem to have this effect.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"The possible scarcity of copper (and the likely resulting pressure on prices) is an issue of concern, especially in the light of its importance for the ever growing networking industry. Also for that reason, copper is the nonferrous metal most traded in the markets. Therefore, assessing the nature of its price fluctuations is an important task. Several papers have been devoted to analysing the characteristics of the time series of copper prices, especially for the purpose of predicting its future behaviour. The field of approaches can be divided roughly equally between those adopting a stochastic model and those opting for a deterministic nonlinear (chaotic) model. Nevertheless, while papers employing the stochastic paradigm have completely ignored the presence of chaotic features, at the same time papers recognizing the chaotic paradigm have neglected the presence of noise.The purpose of this paper is to investigate copper price behaviour in the CMX, considering a very long time series and adopting estimation methods that provide the coexistence of stochastic and chaotic features. We find that: a) the presence of noise is very significant (amounting to more than a quarter of the average signal value), as well as the presence of chaotic features; b) intermittency is present, which may be indicative of a bubble-related value that emerged without any fundamental cause.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"The heterogeneity in resource endowment and the “resource curse” require different tax rates for different regions in resource tax ad valorem reform. Considering that copper is critical, widely distributed and closely related to the economy, a dynamic multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is constructed to investigate the impacts of different copper resources tax rates on regional economies, thus obtaining the optimised resource tax rate due to the “resource curse” in different regions. Under different policy scenarios of the copper resource tax, namely, 2%, 5% and 8%, this paper estimates the impacts of resource tax ad valorem reform on copper consumption, macroeconomic variables and sector outputs among 4 representative regions, which is significantly different from the results from national perspective in previous studies. The simulated results are as follows: resource tax ad valorem reform has an enormous influence on copper consumption and has slightly positive impacts on resident income, government revenue, total consumption and real gross domestic product (GDP), while it affects copper-related sectors outputs in a negative way. Additionally, the impacts under the same scenario are significantly different among 4 regions. Moreover, under different tax rate scenarios, copper consumption increases first and then decreases, resulting in an inverted U-shaped pattern. This paper built a dynamic computable general equilibrium (DCGE) model of copper resource tax ad valorem reform from a regional perspective, thus improving the CGE model on a national scale compared to previous studies and providing an analytical paradigm for the reform of other strategic metal mineral resource taxes in China.","Volume 58, Pages 1-314 (October 2018)",October 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/58/suppl/C,1
"China's mining and quarrying industry is characterized by “high pollution, high energy consumption, and high emissions.” Improving this sector's green total factor productivity (TFP) is of great importance for furthering the sustainable development of China's economy. Using a global data envelopment analysis (DEA), this paper analyzes the green TFP of China's mining and quarrying industry for the period of 1991–2014 with regard to technology, scale, and management. The following results are found. First, during the sample period, the green TFP of China's mining and quarrying industry increased by 71.7%. Technological progress was the most important contributor, and the decline in scale efficiency and management efficiency were two inhibitors. Fortunately, in recent years, management efficiency has gradually improved and become a new impetus for green TFP growth. Second, the characteristics of the green TFPs in the sub-industries vary considerably. During the sample period, the green TFPs of the mining and processing of ferrous metal ores (MPFMO), the mining and processing of non-ferrous metal ores (MPNFMO), and the mining and processing of nonmetal ores (MPNO) grew rapidly and became the benchmarks, whereas those of the mining and washing of coal (MWC) and the extraction of petroleum and natural gas (EPNG) remained very low. Third, the returns to scale of the sub-industries also varied. EPNG, MPNFMO, MPNO were in the stage of increasing returns to scale or constant returns to scale during the entire period, whereas MWC and MPFMO have recently entered the stage of decreasing returns to scale.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"We examine the hedging performance of commodities futures for US real estate portfolios in a multi-scale setting. Dynamic asymmetric conditional correlations and thereafter optimal hedge ratios of real estate stock returns with commodities index, gold, oil and bond returns are estimated to examine hedge effectiveness under heterogeneous market expectations. Rolling window based out-of-sample one-step-ahead forecasts show that commodities index (gold) provide the best hedge to US real estate stocks for short-term (long-term) investments. The results are robust to the choice of model refits and rolling window sizes and provide useful implications for alternate markets’ investors.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"Supplier selection as a multi-criteria decision-making problem that highly depends on the decision makers’ vision has a major issue among supply chain (SC) managers. SC sustainability, which pays attention to the environmental, economic, and social aspects in SC, has been recently highlighted in the evaluation process undergone by the SC managers. Suppliers, as the basic components of the SC, play a significant role in creating a sustainable SC. Hence, the first aim of this research is to determine the weights of sustainability criteria by using analytical hierarchy process. The second aim of this study is to evaluate suppliers based on four main criteria, CO2 emissions, the number of employees in the suppliers’ country industry, water consumption and distance from supplier's country to the destination at three SC levels and the macroeconomic (international) level. In order to address the second goal of this research, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method as a multi-criteria decision-making method has been applied. In this research, Iran's steel industry has been selected as the case study. Results show that the Iranian mining industry is the best sustainable supplier for Iran's steel industry. In addition, Iran was found as the best sustainable supplier country for most suppliers in Iran's steel industry SC based on the three SC sustainability criteria at three levels. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been applied according to the different weights of the sustainability criteria. The results of this research can help managers in the steel industry to deal with the supplier selection problem at the macro-level. Furthermore, the presented approach in this research can assist managers of other industries to select and evaluate their suppliers.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"As a critical raw material, iron ore plays an important role in the development of the national economy, which results in intense competition between iron ore importers. Using the international iron ore trade data of the UN Comtrade from 2000 to 2015, this paper calculates the competition intensity between iron ore importers importing iron ore from the same exporters. The paper then constructs iron ore import competition networks with the importers as nodes, the import competitive relations as edges, and the competition intensity as weights of edges. Applying complex network theory, the paper analyzes the overall characteristics of the iron ore importing competition pattern, the import competition region and the main importing countries. The results reveal that the global iron ore import competition is tight, unbalanced and expanding and that the global iron ore import competitive pattern is moving from a core-periphery structure to a reticular structure. Although Australia and Brazil are both the main competition regions, the demand for Australian iron ore is more intense. The import competitive relations for iron ore exist primarily between Europe and Asia as well as intra-European and intra-Asian markets. The total import competition intensities between China and Japan and between China and South Korea are much larger than other competitive relationships with increasing trends from 2000 to 2015. We propose three policy recommendations for the importers: (1) diversifying the import channels; (2) enhancing the cooperation between importers; (3) investing in overseas equity mines to improve competitiveness.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"A widespread and pessimistic view of the availability of mineral commodities calls for strong government initiatives to ensure adequate future supplies. This article provides a more market oriented and optimistic perspective, one that focuses on production costs and prices rather than physical availability. It sees short-run shortages continuing to plague commodity markets in the future as in the past. Though painful while they last, these shortages are temporary and do not pose a serious long-run threat to human welfare. Moreover, even without government intervention, they self-correct. The sharply higher prices that they evoke create strong incentives that foster supply and curb demand.Potentially more serious are long-run shortages due to mineral depletion. Such shortages are often thought to be inevitable, a conclusion that flows directly from the physical view of depletion. For various reasons, we reject this view of depletion in favor of an economic view. The latter recognizes that depletion may create long-run shortages, but stresses that this need not be the case if new technology can continue to offset the cost-increasing effects of depletion in the future as it has in the past. The economic view also suggests that a list of mineral commodities most threatened by depletion can best be compiled using cumulative availability curves rather than the more common practice of calculating commodity life expectancies based on estimates of available stocks.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"Economic policies play a vital role in shaping economic development of an economy, and any uncertainty in the policies slows down its development process. Several factors are identified as predictors of economic policy uncertainty, and of these, gold price has been identified as the most significant. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the association between economic policy uncertainty and gold prices by using the monthly data from 1995 (January) to 2017 (March). The standard linear Granger causality test and nonparametric causality-in-quantiles approach have been applied for empirical purpose. The standard linear Granger causality test shows that no causal association exists between economic policy uncertainty and gold prices. Then, the nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test given by Balcilar et al. (2016a) is applied. This approach allows for examining the quantile causality-in-mean and variance. The result of the nonparametric causality-in-quantiles shows the rejection of null hypothesis, which implies that economic policy uncertainty causes gold prices in all the examined countries, especially at the low tails. Moreover, the quantile causality-in-variance also shows the acceptance of null hypothesis in the majority of the cases. This study provides valuable implications for academics, policy makers, and investors.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"This study considers the contours of the coal transition in the United States from the perspective of local planning responses to coal plant retirements in the U.S. West. Plant closures in the region affect a diverse set of geographies and have developed in a complex, uncoordinated policy environment. The study applies an assessment framework informed by economic geography and community planning scholarship to a dataset of 12 planning documents written by and for local communities experiencing coal facility closures. The findings highlight the absence of effective strategies to address lost local revenues, lack of connections between environmental quality and long-term economic resilience, and a range of levels of acceptance of the coal transition. Together, the plans demonstrate the negative consequences of an uncoordinated, contradictory policy environment for transition planning at the local level and the need for policy interventions to address issues of equity and efficiency in this process.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"Physical climate risk faced by companies is emerging as a significant concern for long term investors, such as sovereign wealth funds. For the mining sector, each physical asset may have a significant financial exposure to extreme climate events such as floods and droughts. Often, these financial risks are difficult to value given the paucity of data on climate extremes, and limited company assessment and disclosure of the associated financial liability. We propose a generalization of the Brennan-Schwartz approach to real option valuation to address this situation. A Poisson point process is used to model arrivals of extreme events that exceed the estimated design return period of the flood/drought mitigation infrastructure at the site. Using techniques from the field of robust performance analysis, we are able to calculate upper and lower bounds over all the probability models within a certain distance from the original model, that address the potential uncertainty of the risk and loss. We suggest two different approaches for mine valuation based on this technique. The first, and more direct approach, calibrates the distance of probability measures from a set of known mine transactions and prices a mine (with currently unknown value) relative to the training set of mines. The second approach uses historical precipitation data from a mine site, to calculate a “worst case” disaster arrival process from the actual physical data, and then the mine is priced using this process. Generalizations to a portfolio of assets are also considered.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"In 2014, the list of Critical Raw Materials for the European Union included for the first time an energy fossil resource: coking coal. Its presence was due to its high economic importance, being the second raw material in the list immediately after tungsten, although with a low supply risk as Australia and USA were the main exporters of coking coal to the European Union in recent years. However, on the 2017 list, coking coal is considered a borderline case. Although it narrowly misses the economic importance threshold, for the sake of caution, coking coal is kept on the list and thus included in the table. However, it will be phased out from the next list should it fail to meet the criteria in full.Successive depletion of coking coal deposits generates the need to develop new mines in order to maintain the production level of coal mining companies for the years to come. The process of building new mines is high capital-intensive, with long terms needed for the different investment steps. That is why providing a tool for the coal mining companies that will allow quick discrimination between feasible and unfeasible projects, in order to reduce time consuming analysis together with their costs, while shortening mine development cycles is a critical issue.Trying to boost the European Union's Raw Material Initiative by complementing its efforts from an economic perspective, this paper provides an exhaustive analysis of present day coking coal mining investment. To achieve this goal, it analyses in first place the trends and evolution of coking coal prices in order to contrast the forecasts used by the different projects. Secondly, it will study five ready-to-go coking coal projects around the world: the Lublin underground project in Poland; Kodiak underground project in the USA; Amaam opencast project in Russia; Makhado opencast project in South Africa; and Crown Mountain opencast project in Canada.Conclusions of this research clearly state that it is possible to establish a relationship between capital expense and clean coal production in opencast projects and that the predicted yield and the transport costs are critical parameters in order to assess the operating costs of a coking coal mining investment project. Finally, the financial outcomes claimed by the projects are compromised due to the lack of adequate price forecasting and to the use of fictitious discount rates for calculating the Net Present Value.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"Mining provides inputs for other industrial sectors that are vital for sustaining population wellbeing and the functioning of global economies. At the same time, it can generate social and environmental impacts, which could compromise public acceptance of the sector. Given this twofold role in human society, the improvement of the sustainability performance is a very important objective both for industry and for the European policy, willing to boost a sustainable supply of raw materials.In various contexts, social impacts of mining are assessed with different sets of indicators and targets. In this study we perform a review of the associated literature, identify a list of typical social impacts occurring in the sector, and explore their geographical distribution. The list of identified impacts is compared against the indicators used for assessing and promoting sustainability in different contexts and at different scales: (i) the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), (ii) the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), (iii) the EU policy making through the analysis of the Better Regulation policy and three impact assessment reports, and (iv) the databases used in Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA).Land use-related impacts and environmental impacts affecting human health and human rights appear to be the most concerning social aspects in the mining sector. Benefits from income and employment are, instead, the main positive impacts identified in the screened literature.The paper compares the different indicator sets used in the above-mentioned frameworks with the list of impacts emerged from the literature review. Working conditions and human rights are well-covered aspects in the indicator lists. Main differences concern demographic changes and migration due to the presence of a mine and land use-related impacts, which are described in literature and partially covered in other schemes. A challenge for sustainability assessment is the evaluation of the mining sector's contribution to society, beyond the mere economic value added, and in general the assessment of positive impacts.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"Environmental responsibility and the sustainable development of mineral resources are a topic of critical importance to the mining industry and at the same time relate to operational and rehabilitation costs to be considered in technical studies. Open pit mining operations impact their local environment in terms of their modification of the landscape and local ecosystems. Many of these impacts are the result of the transportation of large volumes of materials mined and shifted from and to different locations. External stockpiles and waste dumps occupy considerable space as well as involve substantial transportation costs to move materials from open pits to stockpiles and then move them back to the pit for rehabilitation after the end of exploitation. Depending on the shape of the deposit and the intended design of the pit, a desirable option may be to place it directly in the free spaces within the pit, instead of storing all waste and tailings materials in stockpiles and/or waste/tailings dumps. This paper presents a new mathematical formulation integrating to life-of-mine planning and the maximization of net present value, with the related waste and tailings disposal kept within the mined-out parts of a pit, using a stochastic integer program that manages geological uncertainty including metal grades, material types and related chemical compositions. In addition to the traditional variables related to the materials being extracted from the ground in the form of mining blocks, strips of ground following the dip of a pit are considered within the pit as decision variables, and the optimization process aims to optimally define both the sequence of extraction of mining blocks and the reservation of strips needed to store waste materials. An application at an iron ore mine demonstrates the feasibility, applied aspects and advantages of the proposed method.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"Mining of mineral resources entails significant deforestation in developing countries. The large financial rewards associated with mining create corrupt linkages between the government regulators and mining industry, often resulting in illegal extraction of minerals in environmentally sensitive areas. We develop a model of political-industry corrupted relationship to explore the problem of illegal mining of iron ore and its impact on deforestation in Goa, India. For the regulator, the decision to allow illegal extraction and relaxation from environmental remediation requirement is made with the objective of accumulating illegal wealth while simultaneously mitigating the risks of political ouster and conviction. Results suggest that several factors, such as the relative risks of political survival and conviction, the degree of impatience displayed by the regulator as well as the contribution of the mining sector to the economy, play a role in influencing the extent of illegal mining activity. When the regulator faces a low risk of political ouster, an increase in conviction risk may not provide enough deterrence to illegal mining, resulting in high levels of deforestation.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"The natural gas reserves discovered in Israel in recent years have instigated a debate on sociopolitical, international political, security, and economic issues. Examination and analysis of various policy documents that affected the final consolidation of Israel's gas policy show that the issue of natural gas discoveries in Israel is complex and characterized by many intricacies and uncertainties that create a unique collection of problems and solution. First, there are difficulties involved in setting a time frame for the public policy designed on the topic of natural gas. Second, the work division and interaction between the government, the public, and private companies is particularly complex. Third, the taxation policy must take into account benefits for the state and its residents but at the same time maintain and preserve the incentives offered to investors and developers. Fourth, it is hard to disregard the fact that the Israeli government has chosen not to bring the decision regarding the gas outline for public debate or for review by the Knesset, and fifth, the decision about how much of the gas reserves should be preserved for domestic needs and how much exported is particularly complex.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"Mining plays an increasingly important role in Vietnam's economy and has been central to the economic and social development strategies of a number of provinces. Yet, to date, the ways in which mining is experienced by local residents in mining communities has received relatively little attention. This research employed Q-methodology to examine community perceptions concerning the impact of gold mining in Phuoc Duc and Tam Lanh communes, Quang Nam province, Vietnam. As local subjectivities regarding resource extraction are complex and diverse, Q-methodology allows for the identification of distinct and comparable viewpoints within and between study communities. Results indicate that within Phuoc Duc commune, perceived impacts on the standard of living, livelihoods, health, and quality of life were all concerns of local residents. Perceptions of residents in Tam Lanh indicated a concern for impacts on health and the standard of living as well as limited government protection. Findings from the two case studies suggest that local people's subjectivities about mining impacts were highly nuanced and influenced by geography, demographics, history and culture.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"China is currently facing a severe challenge to indium resource security, mainly due to a lack of foresight regarding current policy decisions. This paper constructed a modified user cost model to calculate the indium resource tax and then constructed a transformed Lerner index and an SMR model based on the seller’s perspective to calculate the value of market power. Then, it embedded those parameters into a tax transfer model to evaluate the alternative effects of the indium resource tax on tariffs. As we observed, the theoretical tax rate for the indium resource tax fluctuated between 0.67% and 15.53%, and the alternative tax rate for the indium resource tax ranged from 0.32% to 13.03%. By evaluating the alternative effects of the resource tax on tariffs from an endogenous perspective, it can be seen that market powers of the indium processing enterprise and export enterprise, the supply price elasticity of indium processing enterprise and the demand price elasticity of indium export enterprise will have a significant impact on the effect of substituting tariffs with a resource tax. Therefore, the Chinese government should accelerate the vertical integration of the indium resource industry and enhance the market power and supply elasticity of export enterprises through policy measures. Taking the resource tax as the core means of indium resource management, strategies to prevent international disputes concerning the selection of raw materials for trade are discussed, and new analytical insights and directions are provided, which can be applied to similar issues for other metals.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2

"The aim of this paper is to study the continuous and time-varing long-run relationships among three metals’ prices, oil price, and the US dollar exchange rate. The recursive cointegration is applied to trace the dynamic linkages. The empirical evidence is follows. First, the results of the recursive trace statistics display one significant and strong conitegration among the gold price and the other variables over much of the period after 1995, and that the European sovereign debt crisis caused a closer linkage from 2010 to 2012. Second, rising gold prices increase silver and copper prices in the long run and are also a long-run leading indicator of silver and copper prices, but their function as a leading signal becomes unstable and weaker after the 2008–2009 global financial crisis. Finally, the long-run relationship between oil and gold prices is an inverse interaction before 2003, but then turns uncertain after 2003, and there is no long-run causality between the two prices.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"This paper proposes an iterative model-building approach known as quantile boosting to trace out the predictive value of realized volatility and skewness for gold futures returns. Controlling for several widely studied market- and sentiment-based variables, we examine the predictive value of realized moments across alternative forecast horizons and across the quantiles of the conditional distribution of gold futures returns. We find that the realized moments often significantly improve the predictive value of the estimated forecasting models at intermediate forecast horizons and across quantiles representing distressed market conditions. We argue that realized moments carry information that reflects investors’ tradeoff between diversification and skewed payoffs, particularly during periods of market stress, which may be especially relevant for gold as the traditional accepted safe haven.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"In response to the increasing loss of biodiversity, several countries have adopted offsetting policies that seek to balance habitat destruction by restoring, enhancing and/or protecting equivalent values offsite. Such mechanisms are increasingly important in quarrying, where habitat loss may be unavoidable due to colocation of mineral resources and areas of biodiversity importance. Seeking to contribute to advance understanding of the current gaps and challenges, biodiversity offsetting required for environmental approval of three limestone quarries in compliance with Brazil's Atlantic Forest Act, a federal law that aims at protecting this biodiversity hotspot, were investigated. Both protection and restoration offsets were applied at area ratios from 1:1.1 to 1:5. Offset implementation costs ranged from ~3 to ~8% of quarry investment. The main difficulties reported by practitioners are finding suitable areas, lack of methods to calculate residual losses and uncertainties about the success of restoration. Internationally recommended best practices are partially followed with the highest adherence observed for the quarry whose environmental impact study was more detailed and provided a stronger basis for designing the offset. Results suggest that the quality of offset planning and implementation is directly related to the quality of the environmental impact assessment.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"Unlike prior studies, this study examines the nonlinear, asymmetric and quantile effects of aggregate commodity index and gold prices on the price of Bitcoin. Using daily data from July 17, 2010 to February 2, 2017, we employed several advanced autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models. The nonlinear ARDL approach was applied to uncover short- and long-run asymmetries, whereas the quantile ARDL was applied to account for a second type of asymmetry, known as the distributional asymmetry according to the position of a dependent variable within its own distribution. Moreover, we extended the nonlinear ARDL to a quantile framework, leading to a richer new model, which allows testing for distributional asymmetry while accounting for short- and long-run asymmetries. Overall, our results indicate the possibility to predict Bitcoin price movements based on price information from the aggregate commodity index and gold prices. Importantly, we report the nuanced result that most often the relations between bitcoin and aggregate commodity, on the one hand, and between bitcoin and gold, on the other, are asymmetric, nonlinear, and quantiles-dependent, suggesting the need to apply non-standard cointegration models to uncover the complexity and hidden relations between Bitcoin and asset classes.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2

"Due to poor technology and lack of proper skills in mineral processing techniques, a greater percentage (about 70%) of gold is lost to the tailings stream in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). These tailings, in the last decade, have become a major source of revenue for some large-scale mining (LSM) companies in Ghana because they have advanced technologies to optimize recovery. This paper examines the tailings trade between ASGM and LSM companies in Ghana and determines their associated relationships. It also informs policy decisions regarding gold mining in Ghana. Field visits were made to licensed ASGM sites in the Tarkwa Mining District where the trade is mostly practiced to obtain first-hand information and conduct interviews with diggers. Results indicate that both ASGM operators and LSM companies derive revenue from the tailings trade, exhibiting a relationship that could be described as mutualistic. Based on the tailings price determination, the symbiotic relationship is described as parasitic because the tailings pricing process is largely controlled by the LSM companies to the detriment of the ASGM operators. As a result of the environmental dangers posed by the tailings trade, the interdependency could equally be described as parasitic since both the ASGM operators and the LSM companies benefit to the detriment of the natural ecosystem. It was also observed that while some stakeholders attempt to criminalize the tailings trade, there is presently no law or regulation that prohibits such trade in the Ghanaian mining industry.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2
"This article contributes to the literature on unintended effects by adding a dimension to existing typologies: exaggerated unintended effects. It analyses the existence of this dimension resulting from the adoption of the United States’ conflict minerals legislation, the Dodd-Frank act, article 1502. The article makes evident that there were two competing narratives on the unintended effects of the American regulation: the duration and the scope of the de facto embargo. While in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC; the target of the legislation) the negative unintended effects were declining, the dominant narrative on unintended effects was not changing and omitted crucial elements. A quantitative analysis shows that especially those companies that stood to gain from deregulation did not incorporate these positive developments into their narrative. The narratives of other stakeholders, such as non-governmental organizations and investors, progressed together with the changes observed in the DRC. The research indicates how the discussion on unintended effects impacted the formulation on conflict minerals regulation in the European Union. The article concludes by drawing parallels to debates on unintended negative effects in other domains of international cooperation, such as migration. It is suggested that policy makers, researchers and journalists verify claims of negative unintended effects before integrating them into their own narratives.",Volume 57,August 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/57/suppl/C,2

We find no robust long-run effect of oil abundance on any of the following measures of democracy: Polity, Polcon, Civil Liberties, or Political Rights, over the period 1974–2012. We use different country and period samples to respond to the findings of others suggesting that the effects of oil abundance may differ between Latin America, the Middle East, mature oil producers, or that they become significantly negative only post-1980. In each case we still do not find a robust relationship.

"Kavilal et al. (Resour. Policy 51 (2017) 204–218) pointed out the limitations of the fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (FPROMETHEE) method. To overcome the limitations, Kavilal et al. proposed an effective approach by integrating the FPROMETHEE, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy interpretive structural modeling (FISM). To illustrate this approach, Kavilal et al. considered a case example of a mining equipment manufacturer located in India. In future, the other researchers may use this approach for solving other real life problems and /or in their research work. It is pertinent to mention that to apply the approach, proposed by Kavilal et al., there is need to apply FAHP and to apply FAHP, there is need to check that the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix is consistent or not. To check the same, Kavilal et al. have transformed the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix into a crisp matrix and claimed that the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix will be consistent if the transformed crisp matrix will be consistent. However, after a deep study, it is observed that on applying the defuzzification method, used by Kavilal et al. to transform the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix into a crisp matrix, the obtained transformed crisp matrix will never be consistent therefore, one may conclude that the FAHP cannot be applied. Hence, one may conclude that the approach, proposed by Kavilal et al., cannot be applied.

"Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are collectively the single most significant asset or among the most significant assets for any company in the minerals industry, yet their value is often not reflected on primary financial statements of the company. This challenge arises from the misalignment between financial reporting and mineral asset valuation (MAV). Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves can be valued using MAV methodologies that generally have a forward-looking perspective, while financial reporting on the other hand is conducted based on a generally historical performance perspective of the company in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) depending on the jurisdiction.In addition, financial reporting in the minerals industry is not yet fully developed as IFRS 6 appears to be the only available mineral-specific financial reporting standard. There is also currently a lack of a comprehensive accounting standards for the minerals industry to guide the accounting, recognition and presentation of these assets on the primary financial statements. In order to bridge the gap between MAV and financial reporting, this paper presents a framework applicable to developmental properties and operating mines. The framework was validated by applying it to a real life case study and can be used to estimate values for companies in the minerals industry by linking back to the fundamental asset which is the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"The end of the 2000s commodity super cycle resulted in all-time high market values for most commodity based companies, followed by a rapid decline in the values post the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008. The period 2006–2015 was therefore an appropriate review period as it enabled reviewing changes in company value pre and post the GFC.In order to determine the key drivers of company value, financial and production data of four diversified and international mining companies was analyzed. Each of the four companies had a different commodity mix. Due to its suitability for comparison of company value, the market based valuation approach was selected as the appropriate company valuation technique, using enterprise value (EV) as the value metric.Eight potential value drivers were identified. These are production output; commodity price; revenue; earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple; EBITDA margin; gearing ratio; net debt to EBITDA ratio; and return on capital employed (ROCE). The eight potential value drivers were analyzed firstly using graphical checks, followed by numerical determination of the degree of correlation between each potential value driver and EV using the Pearson correlation coefficient method to confirm the visual analysis. Hypothesis testing was finally done to investigate the strength of the relationships between the potential value drivers and EV.This paper notes some key findings. Revenue, commodity price and EBITDA multiple are primary drivers of value across all four companies, despite their different commodity mix. Of these three drivers revenue is the strongest value driver. It was also noted that the two debt metrics, gearing ratio and net debt to EBITDA, only correlated with EV in times of declining commodity prices and revenue, indicating that value drivers can change with changing economic conditions. It is therefore important for mining companies to periodically identify key value drivers of company value during different economic periods and ensure that they measure their performance based on these.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"The South African mining industry employs close to half a million people. Some of the sub-sectors of the mining industry such as gold and platinum mines are regarded as labour intensive and require modernisation. To improve this situation and ensure the long term survival of the industry, the Chamber of Mines of South Africa has drawn up a strategy to modernise mining by embracing automated and autonomous technologies among others. The unintended consequences of these technologies is the reduction in labour, particularly in low skills categories. It is then prudent to reskill the affected mine workers to lessen the dire effects of redundancy. To this effect, this paper analysed mining forward and backward linkages with the aim of identifying the best path with the most absorptive capacity for redundant mine workers. Based on the economic analysis of mining linkages, it was realised that artisanship training is the relevant skill set for redundant workers.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"ILO Convention 176 provides for worker selected health and safety representatives (HSRs) with which the South African Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA) No 29 of 1996 as amended complies. Although arrangements for worker consultation is well established in other industrialised contexts worldwide, it is threatened by neo-liberalism and a trend within occupational health and safety (OHS) regulation described as ‘responsibilisation.’ This paper examines the experience of South African HSRs in relation to this globalised context. In-depth, semi-structured interviews (n = 37) and short telephone interviews (n = 53) were conducted at four large underground mines (platinum, gold and diamond) with workplace HSR (n = 25) between February 2015 and June 2016. Interviews explored HSR perceptions of their preparation, day-to-day activities, context and experience of OHS transgressions. Interviews were translated, transcribed and thematically analysed (Max QDA 12). A four domain framework was developed to encapsulate the experience of HSRs, that left them feeling accountable, or having to account, for the OHS transgressions of co-workers, and in some instances, facing employer action against themselves. The term ‘creeping responsibilisation’ was introduced to describe the slide towards HSRs holding responsibility for OHS transgressions in place of the employer. The pre-conditions for autonomous worker representation in South Africa are judged to be insufficient which holds lessons for other African states wishing to strengthen their own commitments to OHS.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"This paper explores the different challenges posed by Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) to Sustainable Development (SD), as well as proactive and unrealistic approaches in dealing with these challenges. Since there is no clear cut internationally acceptable definition of ASM, this paper considers ASM as the exploitation of marginal ore deposits, which are not profitable to mine on a large scale, through both informal (I/ASM) and formal channels (F/ASM) using rudimentary tools. I/ASM is illegal while F/ASM is legal and its activities are conducted under the approval of the presiding government. It is mainly I/ASM that poses disastrous challenges to SD. These can be classified into social, economic, environmental, safety and health and political challenges as expressed in the text.The first move towards making ASM a sustainable livelihood is to recognise and formalise it. Peaceful and all-encompassing approaches have to be devised in order to formalise ASM because ASM is a significant source of livelihood for mainly the poor and those who are unemployable due to lack of professional skills, a vivid fact governments cannot afford to ignore. These approaches facilitate easy administration of the sector as miners are held accountable and since they would have been given legal mandate to exploit the mineral deposit. This paper also discusses barriers and challenges to implementation of proactive approaches to ASM. These include International laws like the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 together with international reforms such as Economic Structural Adjustment Programmes (ESAP).Several proactive approaches which interested and affected parties can adopt to realise full returns and benefits from ASM are discussed at length in this paper.Some reactive and unrealistic approaches which countries need to desist from in dealing with ASM challenges are also conveyed by this paper. DRC and Zimbabwe are discussed as country case studies to illustrate poor practices and good practices in dealing with ASM respectively.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"Optimization is a key aspect of the mine design and planning process. A number of algorithms and techniques have been developed to optimize mines. However, most of these techniques focus on open pit optimization to an extent that some authors argue that open pit limit optimization has reached saturation level. Optimization of underground mines only received attention in recent decades and has been focused on three main areas including stope boundary optimization. This paper reviews and analyzes literature on algorithms developed to date for stope boundary optimization. There has been an increase in the number of algorithms developed to optimize stope layout. Most of these algorithms are heuristic, consider stope dimension as one of the constraints and optimize layouts in three dimensional space. However, all these algorithms are based on deterministic orebody models, therefore, fail to consider uncertainty intrinsic in ore deposits. Also, none of these algorithms guarantee optimal stope layout solution in three dimension. Consequently, there is a need for further research in the field of stope boundary optimization.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"Environmental stewardship is the keystone to sustainability in mining and industry. While environmental compliance appears to be costly at first sight, it gives a mining company a competitive edge. Several pieces of legislation have been enacted as a means to deal with impacts of mining on the environment and hence provide an enabling environment for sustainable development (SD). The industry has adopted the principles of environmentally responsible mining, in line with the recommendations of international bodies like the International Organization for Standards (ISO), The Equator Principles Association and International Finance Corporation (IFC).This paper evaluates the sustainability of the South African mining industry in the light of the National Planning Commission (NPC)’s overview that ‘South Africa's growth path is highly resource-intensive and hence unsustainable.’ Arguments are presented to refute this viewpoint and additional impacts of mining on the environment, not mentioned by the NPC, are also discussed together with the measures that the mining industry has taken to resolve such impacts.Although the mining industry has instituted emergency preparedness measures, environmental incidents do occur, but these isolated incidents do not provide evidence that mining is unsustainable. Such events are a feature of all sectors of the economy. The author advocates the establishment of a SD legal framework through consultative discussions with interested and affected parties to create an environment conducive for legal compliance, which would include SD indicators to enable the Department of Minerals and Resources to monitor company compliance and identify defaulting companies.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"Despite the considerable challenges posed by artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), it remains part of our lives. Conflict between ASM miners as well with large-scale mining companies, civil strife, social unrest, and corruption to mention a few problems are the order of the day in ASM. Environmental damage and possible contribution to economic meltdown are a cause for concern. The main thrust of this paper is to discuss the challenges posed by ASM across the whole spectrum of political, social, economic, and environmental and health and safety issues. The paper also proposes some proactive and realistic approaches to resolve the challenges discussed in order to move from conflict to sustainability in mine planning. ASM is characterized by relatively uneducated and unregistered miners, and policies targeting ASM miners should be disseminated in a comprehensible manner lest such policies remain in our dreams and the policy books. Since it is the government that funds clean-up of the mess from ASM, one of the best ways to avoid this expenditure is developing cooperative approaches through different governmental instruments, persuading the ASM miners to mine responsibly. The contribution of ASM to unemployment reduction cannot be ignored, but being mainly an informal sector, it is very difficult to quantify its contribution to economic development. Capturing meaningful rent from these miners may also remain a dream if non-consultative policies are imposed on this sector. Tracing the miners can be a nightmare when reactive approaches are implemented. Large-scale mining companies, government, and civil society at large have to adopt a cooperative approach to devise sustainable, workable, and realistic ways to convert ASM miners into contributors to sustainable development.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"A sound relationship between Large Scale Mining/Miners (LSMs) and communities is key to a successful and mutually beneficial mining venture. This relationship has to be carefully managed to ensure a conducive operating environment. Merely sticking to the dictates of a government issued mining licence by LSMs and not facing reality on the ground may spark stiff resistance from the communities on which the mining company has to operate. Two competing priorities have to be balanced - the LSM, having a mining licence, argue that they have a legal right from the government to mine while the community, which have stayed on the mining area for generations, claim the area as their birth right and believe they inherently have the mining right. A well-coordinated consultative approach and cooperation with communities is vitally important in breaking this impasse.Community empowerment is one of the central themes discussed in the paper. The mining companies need to leave a lasting positive legacy for the communities so that they can sustain life well beyond mine closure. The mineral resource capital needs to be converted to other capitals on which the community can thrive well beyond mine closure. The paper discusses different strategies which can be adopted to ensure productive partnerships between LSMs and the communities to realise the lasting positive legacy. The strategies include: investment in education, which may lead to employment in other sectors of the economy, establishment of survival community projects, investment in adequately managed community trusts, designation of areas amenable to Artisanal and Small Scale Mining (ASM), attainment of social licence to operate, procurement of labour from the communities wherever possible and strategic accommodation planning to avert ghost towns among others.Four compelling case studies are used to give impetus to the arguments expressed in the paper. These include the partnerships of the following LSMs with communities in their mining areas: Royal Bafokeng Holdings and the Roya Bafokeng Nation in South Africa, Zimbabwe Platinum Mines (Zimplats) and Mhondoro Ngezi, Chegutu and Zvimba communities in Zimbabwe, Anglo Gold Mining Company and Sadiola in Mali as well as Ghana Consolidated Diamonds and Akwatia in Ghana.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"Traditional communities in Africa hold land in high esteem. As such, when rights to minerals are granted to Multi-National Mining Companies on community lands, it heightens tensions and sometime erode the trust relationship with local governments and the State. A factor which contributes to this, is the non-alignment of the interest between the States’ exclusive rights and communities’ right to land after minerals’ discovery. In addition, experiences from colonial practices infringing on customary and mineral rights heighten the tensions between traditional societies and governments. This paper discusses some of the root causes of such tensions vis-à-vis the assignment of mineral rights and their effect on customary land rights frameworks. The mineral rights’ frameworks of Ghana, Namibia, South Africa and Tanzania are explored for a better understanding of the tensions that arise in mining communities. Recommendations in light of formalising communities’ rights with mining companies’ and social licence to operate may assist in building transparency and the ‘trust’ needed amongst stakeholders in mining regimes.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"Bulk commodities such as iron ore moving on a conveyor belt represent a one-dimensional lot providing an ideal opportunity for probabilistic cross-belt or cross-stream sampling at regular time intervals. The quality of such materials is measured by the mean, but the variability in the analyses arises from a variety of sources and is aggregated in a single figure for the standard deviation. The application of variography to a time-series of data analyses from a moving conveyor provides an effective means of analysing and disaggregating the sources of variability captured in the standard deviation of the data. Each component of variability leaves a distinctive fingerprint on the variogram, allowing its magnitude and contribution to the overall variability to be identified. Identifying sources of variability also enables one to make suggestions as to what aspect of the sampling protocol and sampling equipment requires improvement. The terms Sampling Capacity, Sampling Capability and Sampling Guidelines and their information content in the establishment of customer specification limits, in keeping with process plant capability, is described. Sources of variability arising from the Fundamental Sampling Error and Grouping and Segregation Error give rise to random variability that must be minimised through careful heterogeneity tests. Non-random variability due to plant process and biases associated with Delimitation Error, Extraction Error, Preparation Error and Weighting Error are identified and mitigated and may be eliminated by reducing the sampling interval and ensuring that sampling equipment recovers a correct sample. Cyclical variability in process streams is particularly detrimental to consistency in the grade of the product and its sources and methods for mitigation by reducing the sampling interval, are discussed. Reduction of large-scale variability provides significant opportunities to improve the product specifications and probably improve costs effectiveness through a less demanding blending routine. Determination of more appropriate specification limits can improve throughput and resource utilization.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"Mining is a capital intensive business that requires a large amount of upfront capital to cover development and infrastructure costs. Major infrastructure and development required to access the orebody must last for the life of mine. Net present value is commonly used to determine the economic viability of a project and it is driven by production rate among other parameters. This paper tested variation as well as correlation between production rates estimated (based on rules of thumb) and actual production rates reported by mines. Visual observations and correlation coefficients were used to test the rules of thumb and production rate. Data from the blue chip platinum mining companies was used to determine and test variability of production rates estimated using three rules of thumb. The paper established variations of up to 218% among the three rules of thumb tested on production rate as well as weak correlations (average correlation coefficient of −0.02) between production rates reported by mines and rules of thumb. Therefore, this paper concludes that the size and geometry of a deposit cannot be used independently for all deposits to estimate production rate. Authors recommend research into both size and geometry under changing conditions and formulation of mathematical models to estimate production rates.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"The mining industry continues to be a major source of employment despite challenges faced by mining engineering graduates to get employment. The issue of skills shortage continues to be a major concern and it is perceived as a real threat to the future of mining. Although the industry has undergone several changes in terms technological advancements, it is further envisioned that the future-mine will rely on a highly skilled skeleton labour force with the ability to perform several tasks through automated and remote-controlled operations and monitoring. The industry is expected to be knowledge-driven through a database model that receives and sends information (environmental, mining production and mineral processing) to enable proactive decisions to be made from both operational and control room perspectives. The four main key focus areas of the mine-of-the-future have been identified as operating practices and technology; talent and leadership; partnership with key stakeholders; and governance. A significant question that arises is the preparedness of mining engineering education in Africa to address the vision of the mine-of-the-future in relation to these four focus areas.This paper explores mining engineering programs run in selected countries across four sub-regions in Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Morocco, Ghana and Tanzania). The selection of these countries was based on the criteria including percentage contribution of the country's mineral sector to its GDP; percentage share of the country's mineral exports in its total export; The rank of country's production/supply of mineral commodities in the world; political stability and resource governance index measurement. The universities chosen from each of these countries were based on the Cybermetrics Lab-CSIC university ranking system. Mining engineering programs from these countries were compared with mining engineering programs in two international countries (Canada and Australia).The paper demonstrates a need for an improvement in mining engineering education in Africa to meet the vision of the future-mine.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"Mines classify their resource as ore or waste in various manners. A common approach is to apply a cut-off grade. How this cut-off grade is optimised, has been extensively researched and there are thousands of academic papers covering this topic in the public domain. The question for this paper is if mines are actually considering these various techniques in practice. The background to this research paper is the MSc (Mineral Resource Management) at University of Witwatersrand student assignments where this has been a topic for 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The focus of the students’ research is: “Is it ore or is it waste?”. This question was posed to the students to research it on their operations where they are employed.45 Student assignments representing 39 individual mines were reviewed. These include gold, platinum, coal, diamond, iron ore, manganese, copper and zinc mines. These mines are in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Some commodities and mining methods lend themselves to cut-off grade optimisation. However, it is noted that many mines focus on determining the cut-off grade just on the basic break-even grade and Lane's algorithm and do not optimise the cut-off considering other factors like volume or net present value. There is some evidence of optimisation considering the volume/cost relationship to identify the ‘hill of value’. The Whittle Optimiser as well as the Lerchs-Grossman algorithm is applied for some of the open pit mines reviewed and the optimisation is focused on the NPV. Few, if any of the latest optimisation approaches, are found applied on the mines at operational level reviewed by this exercise.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"While South Africa is respected in the mining fraternity for its seemingly prosperous large-scale mining industry; its artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector is characterised by informal and illegal activities with limited prospects for growth and contribution to socio-economic development. This paper examines through literature review, the institutional frameworks e.g. policy, legislation and programmes put in place to facilitate the development of the ASM sector in order to identify the gaps and challenges in the ASM sector. The recognition of the ASM sector in 1994 came with a series of frameworks aimed at supporting the development of the sector. This paper finds that while the main legislative framework broadly supports a transformation agenda as it pertains to ASM (e.g. increasing the participation of disadvantaged South Africans) there is considerable criticism on the requirements of the framework which are argued to have hindered the development of the sector. In line with the current wave of discussions on policy and legislation reforms in the mining and minerals sector in Africa; it is recommended that South Africa as a signatory to the African Mining Vision (AMV), should consider the domestication of the AMV which would result in the development of appropriate support frameworks for the ASM sector to enable it to contribute to the South African economy.","Volume 56, Pages 1-148 (June 2018)",June 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/56/suppl/C,3
"The Malaysian State of Selangor has been blessed with an abundant reserve of granite rocks located in the districts of Kuala Langat, Hulu Selangor, Gombak, and Hulu Langat which supply raw materials to develop physical infrastructures including highway roads, building, airports, and townships particularly in Cyberjaya and Putrajaya and supply raw materials to the buildings of the Klang Valley. An active industry, however, comes with shortcomings related to the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere and biosphere of the ecosystem. In 2009, there were 314 active quarries in Malaysia of which only 12 practiced the best greening effort. Quarry rehabilitation prevents pollution and leads to a cost-effective measure for sustainable quarrying. At present, there is a need to enhance the existing law and policy to ensure the rehabilitation of quarries. Quarry rehabilitation can strike a balance between the need for development, economic aspect, environment, and social aspects in the long term that produces a sustainable quarrying industry that can benefit the Selangor State Government as well as the Federal Government. Generally, this paper aims to identify factors hindering quarry rehabilitation in Selangor. The specific objective of this research is to identify the present status of quarry rehabilitation implementation and examine what the existing legislative framework provides on quarry rehabilitation. By using a qualitative approach, it focuses on Selangor as a case study. A Doctrinal Approach was used to analyze Primary Legal Documents based on the seven Parameters of Quarry Rehabilitation produced by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) established in 2011.

"To the best of our knowledge, this is the initial study to investigate the predictive power of crude oil volatility index (OVX), a measure of oil market uncertainty, in explaining the return structure of industrial and precious metal markets. Applying different forms of the GARCH-jump model, we document the following major findings. First, we report a significant price spillover running from oil market to industrial metal sector. In addition, jumps do exist in the underlying metal market returns and such jumps are time-varying. Second, we do not find any evidence that oil volatility shocks impact the aggregate precious metal market. However, such effect is present at least in the silver market, if we disaggregate the data. Third, while examining the impact of global financial crisis on the association between oil and metal markets, we report that the effects of OVX hold for both crisis and post crisis periods. Finally, we document the existence of asymmetry in the linkages between oil and the industrial metal markets. To be specific, spillovers for the positive oil volatility shocks appear to be larger than that for the negative oil volatility shocks confirming the existence of uneven spillover effects.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"Processes which produce more than one output jointly are common across a host of industries and play a notable role in mineral supply. Many important commodities including oil and gas, copper and gold, or iron and rare earth elements, are produced together as joint products. Despite its prevalence, joint production has received only minor explicit treatment in the literature on mineral economics. This paper surveys and categorizes the mineral economics literature to highlight notable works and gaps that deserve the attention of future researchers. A key finding of the survey is that little unifying and empirically tested theory explains the behavior of multi-product firms or markets. However, several studies have found that unimportant joint products, sometimes called by-products, tend to be more available in an economic or physical sense than conventional wisdom may hold.

"Modak et al. (Resour.

In this approach, firstly a fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix is transformed into a crisp matrix and then the existing crisp analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach is applied on the transformed crisp matrix. It is well-known fact that the crisp AHP approach can be applied only on the crisp pairwise comparison matrix. While, the crisp matrix, transformed by Modak et al. approach, is not a pairwise comparison matrix. Therefore, it is mathematically incorrect to use the approach, proposed by Modak et al., in its present form. It is pertinent to mention that Modak et al. approach will be valid only if the transformed crisp matrix is also a pairwise comparison matrix.

"This study explores the effects of Chinese rare earth stockpiling, environmental taxation, and improvements in recovery rates on rare earth markets. It uses a Stackelberg model with a leading producer (legal Chinese producers) and two sequential followers (illegal Chinese producers and the Mount Weld mine in Australia), each producing multiple rare earths. The model is parameterized for the production and prices of separated rare earth oxides (REOs) from ore. Counterfactuals involving Chinese policies are compared to the no-policy, business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. The five counterfactuals are: (1) further Chinese State Reserve Bureau (SRB) stockpiling of neodymium, (2) further SRB stockpiling of dysprosium, (3) an environmental tax on the production of legal Chinese rare earths, (4) increased recovery rates of neodymium at legal Chinese operations, and (5) increased recovery rates of dysprosium also at legal Chinese operations. The BAU scenario and five counterfactuals are run with (a) four different levels of reference illegal Chinese production and (b) with and without the Chinese production quota, yielding 48 total outcomes (6×4×2). The first finding is that any SRB stockpile purchase increases the price of the stockpiled REO and increases legal Chinese ore production. However, given co-production, increased ore production involves more production of all REOs, and the prices of non-stockpiled REOs decrease. Thus if the stockpiled REO represents a large (small) portion of illegal Chinese and Mount Weld revenue, then illegal Chinese producers and the Mount Weld mine will increase (decrease) their production. An environmental tax decreases legal Chinese production, increases production by illegal Chinese producers and Mount Weld, and increases prices of all REOs. Increased legal Chinese recovery rates lead to increased legal Chinese production, decreased production by illegal Chinese producers and Mount Weld, and decreased REO prices. Increased levels of reference illegal Chinese production (a) exacerbate the policy-driven production increases or dampen production reductions of illegal producers and (b) conversely, for legal Chinese producers, reduce policy-driven production increases and further increase production reductions.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"This paper investigates the long-run and short-run interaction between stock prices, gold prices and crude oil prices by applying monthly data from Turkey for the period between January 1986 and November 2016. This study uses the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to estimate the cointegration and short-run relationship. The robustness of the ARDL bounds test of cointegration is confirmed using the newly-developed combined cointegration, which also provides the same evidence for a strong long-run relationship. Additionally, this study uses FMOLS, DOLS and CCR cointegrating equations to examine the long-run coefficients between the variables. The evidence reveals that both short-run and long-run results confirm negative relationship between the gold price and stock prices, and a positive relationship between crude oil and stock prices. Furthermore, stock price converges to its long-run equilibrium position by 0.39% speed of adjustments using channel of gold prices and crude oil prices. Finally, the result of the Granger causality test indicates a short-run, long-run and joint unidirectional causation from gold prices to stock prices.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"The most effective parameter on the value of mining projects is metal price volatility. Therefore, knowing the metal price volatility can help the managers and shareholders of the mining projects to make the right decisions for extending or restricting the mining activities. Nowadays, classical estimation methods cannot correctly estimate the metal prices volatility due to their frequent variations in the past years. For solving this problem, it is necessary to use the artificial algorithms that have a good ability to predict the volatility of the various phenomena. In this paper, the Bat algorithm was used to predict the copper price volatility. Accordingly, Brownian motion with mean reversion (BMMR) was chosen as the most suitable time series function with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.449. Then, the estimation parameters of the equation were modified using Bat algorithm. Finally, it is concluded that the determined equation with 0.132 of RMSE can predict the copper price better than the classic estimation methods.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"Geological uncertainty represents an inherent threat for all mining projects. Mining operations utilise resource block models as a primary source of data in planning and in decision making. However, such operational decisions are not free from risk and uncertainty. For the majority of iron ore mines, as an example, uncertainties such as clay pods and variability in grades and tonnages can have dramatic impacts on projects’ viability. However, a paradigm shift on how uncertainty is treated and a willingness to invest in areas that create operational flexibility can mitigate potential losses. Data analytics is touted as one of the major disruptions in the 21st century and operations that properly utilise data can create real opportunities in the face of an uncertain future. Since organisations have abundant definite geological data, a combination of data mining and real options can provide a competitive advantage. In the present study, predictive data mining algorithms were applied to a real case mine operation to predict the probability of encountering problematic ore in a mining schedule. The data mining model outputs were used to generate possible real options that the operations could exercise to deal with clay uncertainty. The most suitable data mining algorithm chosen for this task was the classification tree, which predicted the occurrence of clay with 78.6% precision. Poisson distribution and Monte Carlo simulations were applied to analyse various real options. The research revealed that operations could minimise unscheduled losses in the processing plant and could increase a project's present value by between 12% and 21% if the predictive data mining algorithm was applied to create real options.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4

"Criticality assessment has been widely used in considering resource securement strategies. However, the selection and aggregation of the various risk factors remain a major challenge because these largely depend on subjective judgment by the evaluator. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce an objective perspective, which would develop criticality assessment as a more practical decision-making tool in combination with past subjective approaches. As a first attempt at an objective approach, this study conducted a case-based analysis of 448 supply disruption events for 22 metals. The results indicate 19 categories of causation of disruption, in which accidents, strikes, a fall in metal prices, natural disasters, and policy disputes are dominant. The analyses also reveal the differences in influential risk component between metals and supplier countries. For example, a fall in the metal price has more impact on developed supplier countries than developing countries. The knowledge gained from this case-based approach is useful in highlighting the risk components that have been overlooked in past assessments, in quantifying the integrated risk considering the relative importance of risk components, and in exploring strategies for criticality mitigation.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"The main aim of the article is to estimate the value of and indicate the most significant industrial risk factors associated with the Central-Eastern Europe coal mining industry. The research concerns four coal mining enterprises from Poland, Czech Republic, and Ukraine listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and excavating coal in underground coal mines. According to the research results, the key national risk factors in a book value creation are the coal share in the domestic energy balance and the domestic coal consumption. With respect to external risk factors, the dominant role belongs to coal prices and its substitutes’ prices. Research conclusions allow academics and practitioners to formulate theories on (1) price risk monitoring and hedging, (2) improving and strengthening relations with suppliers and customers, and (3) developing relations with internal and external stakeholders by using CSR assumptions. Such analyses and research contribute to energy economics in the area of value and risk management in mining enterprises. Additionally, it contribute to the non-renewable resources management and could be interesting for managers, investors as well for local governments and communities.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"Investment in mining projects involves significant uncertainty. Project investment is usually high risk, irreversible and challenged by major economic factors. Mining commodity prices in particular always show greater volatility than any other primary products. The variation of these prices is critical in the investment decision of whether the project should go ahead, be abandoned or be delayed. This paper examines the impact of mineral price uncertainty on mining investment decisions using examples of projects in the Asia-Pacific region. Applying the mean reversion (MR) model, the commodity trigger value for investment decisions in each project is determined in the context of operational flexibilities. The findings indicate it is sometimes better to wait for a more suitable time to invest.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"The international rare earths trade pattern has become increasingly complex during the past few years. It attracted wide attention and affected rare earths resources strategies of many countries. This study constructs an international rare earths trade network based on complex network theory to analyze the distribution of trading countries, the overall structure of trade, and the major countries and communities of the network. The results indicate that the international rare earths network displays a scale-free characteristic from 1996 to 2015, which implies that a few trade relationships always exist and that countries play critical roles in the international rare earths trade. The distribution of the kernel density is significantly right-skewed, which indicates that most countries have approximately three trade partners, while only a few countries have a large number of trade partners. Moreover, the world's rare earths trade shows a tendency towards integration. The number of communities in the network has varied from eight to four during the past twenty years.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"Mining operations require access to a secure and stable water supply. Obtaining water use and discharge licenses has become increasingly challenging for mining companies in many resource rich jurisdictions. This can be attributed in part due to competing water uses in water scarce regions and pollution caused by existing and legacy mines. This report provides a comparative review of the water management regulatory frameworks of some of the largest gold and copper producing jurisdictions. The jurisdictions reviewed include Australia (Western Australia), Canada (British Columbia), Chile, China, Peru, the Philippines, South Africa, and the United States (Alaska, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico). Interviews of mining company representatives working on water management issues complement the legal review to highlight the perceived regulatory risk by investors of the analyzed jurisdictions.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"This article presents the first attempt to evaluate the direct economic return of the provision of public geoscience information in Chile. To achieve this goal the study uses multiplier effect ratios through the value chain of PGI and a probabilistic discounted cash flow model to evaluate the economic returns of different scenarios for the ongoing governmental program mandated to generate country-scale geological information, named the National Geological Program.The study shows that, in average, every dollar invested in PGI in Chile during the past three decades could have generated 11.5 dollars of government tax revenues from the mining industry (in terms of its NPV), with an IRR of around 21%. These results are in accordance with comparable studies abroad, but they should be taken carefully due to methodological restrictions of the study. These indicators are positive in almost all the scenarios considered in the study, despite that they show a wide range of results. Similar outcomes are obtained for the National Geological Program when different scenarios are evaluated.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"This paper presents an assessment of the impact of variability and interdependencies of selected deposit parameters on the net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). The subjects of the analyses were three economically viable seams at one of the bituminous coal deposits in Poland. The source of information was the geological model and operational data of the mine “X”. The simulation was developed based on non-parametric bootstrapping, where the influence of coal quality parameters, seam thickness, spatial density of coal, and waste rock derived from coal partings, floor cutting and dinting, and roof falls, was tested.The interdependencies of geological and mining parameters were replicated in a simulation model using Gaussian and empirical copulas. In the model, the relationship between the amount of total waste rock and operating costs was associated with the use of elaborate mathematical formulas. Economic appraisal was based on an income approach, using the free cash flow for the firm (FCFF) analysis and discounting process.Based on the Gaussian copula, in the X-1 and X-2 seams, the average NPV differences achieved were a maximum of 39%. In the case of IRR, the mean difference did not exceed 3.6% points (pp). The quantified spread between the correlated and uncorrelated average values of NPV was at most 45% and 4.8 pp for IRR. Empirical copula limits the range of variation of input and output parameters, resulting in different values for the average NPV, at a maximum of 11.8%, and IRR, 2.4 pp.If the IRR reflects the level of expected return of investment, it can be stated that the additional risk premium resulting from the volatility and correlation of analysed deposits parameters of bituminous coal should be relatively low and less than 2.4 pp in similar cases. The analyses also revealed that the amount of available geological information is of secondary importance in the valuation process, as it does not negatively affect the regularity and symmetry of predicted outcomes.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"The fundamental objective of production planning is to create a mechanism for the implementation of the mining cutoff grades and short-term production planning. One of the most important parameters in open pit design is a determination of the optimal cutoff grade. Optimum cutoff grade results in maximizing profits or maximizing the net present value. Given that in determining the cutoff grade with the goal of maximizing profits, a constant value is obtained for the entire life of the mine. The annual income of the mine will be the same throughout its lifetime, and the time value of the money has not been neglected; which is the main disadvantage of this optimization process. While in optimization with the goal of maximizing net present value, the optimal value will be a function of the time and will be greater in the early years of the mine and will gradually decrease. Optimization of cutoff grades with the aim of maximizing the net present value over the life of the mine is important due to its dependence on the economic parameters, the design of the open pit mining and fundamental issues. Maximizing the net present value is a nonlinear programming problem. To determine the optimal cutoff grade Lane method is commonly used. Lane provided his method to determine the optimal cutoff grade by considering factors such as the capacity of the mine, concentrator and load capacity of the treatment plant, the time value of money and distributing grade. The procedure of the Lane method for cutoff grade calculation is complicated and time-consuming. Considering the widespread use of heuristic methods in optimizing parameters, In the present study genetic algorithm, which is a smart algorithm, is used to determine the optimal cutoff grade. In this paper, we compare the efficiency of the genetic algorithm and Lane's theory in optimizing the degree of limit based on maximizing the net present value. Using separate programming based on the genetic algorithm and considering the capacity limitations and the proportion between the parameters of mining to smelter and refining in the mine is done. For this purpose, consider precision of 0.001%, optimum cutoff grades, the amount of output per unit and the net present value are calculated. The optimum cutoff grade at the beginning of the life of the mine is equal to 0.506% and at the end of the life of the mine to 0.222% using the genetic algorithm. Using the Lane model at the beginning of the life of the mine the optimum cut-off grade from 0/503% to 0/220% reaches at the end of the mine's life. The net present value of earnings over a lifespan of 7 years mine in the genetic algorithm and Lane model is $ 93,467,914 and $ 94,408,000 respectively. Also, the amount of mining, the amount of processing and the amount of refinery obtained by the genetic algorithm method are compared to the Lane model. The results of the research indicate high speed and very low error of genetic algorithm and also a convergence of results with the Lane method.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"While a large number of studies estimate the volatility spillover effects between gold and silver returns, none of them employs the implied volatilities of these two metal markets to assess such uncertainty transmission relationship. Our paper aims to fill this void in the existing literature. At the empirical stage, we make use of two different forms of the bivariate VAR-GARCH model to investigate the implied volatility spillovers between gold and silver markets. Our findings suggest that return and shocks significantly run from gold VIX (GVZ) to silver VIX (VXSLV), but not the other way around. In addition, we show that portfolio risk can be diversified if investors hold options in both gold and silver markets. Our findings are robust with respect to various VAR-GARCH models used in the empirical investigation.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"Many U.S. towns reportedly boomed after new technologies in oil and gas extraction led to rapid development of shale resources. Recent research on the expected economic impact mainly focused on the employment effects associated with new oil and gas jobs. Instead, our focus is on the impact of oil and gas industry growth on local earnings while paying attention to the spatial and sectoral effects and assessing whether an increase in earnings due to energy development seeps out due to the peculiarities of the industry. Our estimation results suggest that oil and gas earnings multipliers are modest and similar to oil and gas employment multipliers, with relatively large shares of the earnings leaving the county on average. Likewise, oil and gas multipliers tend to be smaller or comparable to the estimated multipliers for equal-sized shocks in the rest of the economy, suggesting that oil and gas is not a special industry case.

"The endorsement of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in 2011 has led to many multinational companies making public statements of support for human rights. We provide an in-depth analysis of the challenges company staff face in addressing human rights risks at large infrastructure project sites, especially in relation to their resettlement practices. The research was conducted with two projects in Mozambique: an open-pit coal mine; and the construction of a 900 km railway line. With the cooperation of two multinational mining companies, the design, implementation and outcomes of their compensation and resettlement plans were analysed using a human rights lens. Within the companies there was awareness and commitment to ensure adequate replacement housing and to provide financial compensation at full replacement value. However, there were major challenges related to organizational aspects, including significant time pressure from technical departments, an initial lack of planning regarding the management of community impacts and a lack of experienced staff in social departments. Together with various contextual issues, these challenges ultimately resulted in a failure to compensate and resettle all affected people in a manner that was compliant with human rights. We make seven recommendations that are relevant to respecting human rights in relation to infrastructure projects: (1) companies should carefully consider the positioning of the community relations function within the project; (2) there needs to be greater commitment at the project site level and at all project stages to ensure that international standards for environmental and social performance are met; (3) there must be adequate human rights expertise at the project site level; (4) project resettlement and compensation plans and procedures must document how they will address human rights topics; (5) there must be adequate supervision of subcontractors; (6) projects must properly plan to manage human rights issues irrespective of the realities of complex operating environments; and (7) companies should consider human rights issues in acquisitions and de-acquisitions.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4
"This paper investigates the stimulating role of natural resource abundance in financial development for the case of the USA over the period of 1960–2016. We included education, economic growth and capitalization as additional determinants of financial development in finance demand function. Thus, we applied traditional and recent unit root tests, accommodating unknown structural breaks in the series for examining the unit root properties of the variables. To examine cointegration between the variables, we apply the Bayer-Hanck cointegration approach. The robustness of cointegration relationship is tested by applying the bounds testing approach to cointegration. The empirical results show the presence of cointegration between financial development and its determinants. In the long run, we observe that natural resource abundance contributes to financial development. Education has a positive impact on financial development. A positive relationship exists between economic growth and financial development. Capitalization is inversely linked with financial development. The causality analysis reveals a feedback effect between natural resource abundance and financial development i.e. natural resource abundance causes financial development; in turn, financial development Granger causes natural resource abundance. This empirical evidence provides new insights for policy makers to use natural resource abundance as an economic tool to improve the performance of financial sector by considering the role of economic growth and education.",Volume 55,March 2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/55/suppl/C,4

"The international coal mining industry has experienced serious recent downturns, particularly in the electricity generating market, with steady declines projected into the future. In the United States, increased production from the natural gas sector has made coal-fired power production less competitive, and natural gas power plants are replacing aging coal-fired plants. As such, many of the larger coal companies are in or have recently been in bankruptcy, leaving all coal mining states in the United States at risk for liabilities from abandoned unreclaimed coal mines. Because of the various laws and regulations surrounding the permitting of coal mines, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia employ some form of alternative bonding systems, and Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming employ self-bonding, which allows a coal operator to reduce its secured bond. These alternative bonding systems do not contemplate the risk of a large-scale industry downturn, leaving states at risk for hundreds of millions of dollars of liabilities to reclaim abandoned coal mines and protect the environment and its residents.We examined the reclamation bonds for all coal mines in West Virginia and found that West Virginia faces significant gaps between counties and watershed for the amount of the secured funding for site-specific reclamation. Significant disparities exist such that some residents are much more impacted by the amount of coal mining, as well as the amount of site-specific bonding. We also found that the areas most impacted by the amount of coal mining and reduced site-specific bonding are in the areas with the worst health outcomes. This is a concern for all regions with all types of extractive industries: how to maximize industry while protecting the environment and its residents. Moving forward, states should reconfigure bonding systems to alleviate these risks and burdens on its citizens to prepare for continued declines within the coal industry.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5
"The precious metal markets are subject to the influence of complicated factor characterized by the interrelationship and nonlinearity with the short burst of noise data components. In this paper we propose a new Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD) denoising model to identify the noise factors in the multiscale domain and forecast the precious metal price movement. Since the MEMD model is introduced to analyze and project the inter-relationship between different precious metal prices in the multiscale domain, the transient noise factor is identified, analyzed and suppressed. The movement of the reconstructed precious metal price is modeled using the ARMA model with higher accuracy. Empirical studies using the typical precious metal price data show that the proposed model achieves the statistically significant forecasting performance improvement, which provides the ex-post evidence on the noise factors identified. Further comparative studies of both MEMD and wavelet analysis based models show the complimentary relationship between these two popular multi scale models. We also found that Gold and Silver markets are subject to the similar influence of disruptive noises while Palladium and Platinum markets are subject to the influence of other influencing factors. The disruptive influencing factor is expected to be Euro/Dollar exchange rate.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5
"As China's mining economy needs to transform from investment-driven growth into innovation-driven growth and in empirical researches the innovation has different influence on economic growth, we should make clear whether the innovation can promte China's mining economic growth. This paper constructs a panel data regression model to examine the relationship between the innovation and economic growth in the mining industry using 415 China's listed companies data from 2012 to 2014. The estimation results show that the unitary innovation level has significant positive effect on economic growth in the mineral extractive industry and the electricity, heat, gas and water production and supply industry. More specifically, the innovation elements including government support, the technical employees’ rate and the technical assets rate have significant positive relationships with economic growth in labor intensive state-owned sector or capital intensive mixed sector, but other innovation elements such as the employees’ rate with college degree or above and R&D intensity do not show significant interaction with economic growth in the mining industry. Therefore, to promote sustainable economic growth in the mining industry, the Chinese government should increase government aid to encourage the mineral companies do the scientific research and pay more attention to the cultivation of technical personnel. Finally, attracting more private investment into capital-intensive and state-owned sectors to improve the structure of China's mining industry is the key to boom the economy in the short term.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5
"The intense scholarly debate on the resource curse and political initiatives aimed at preventing it have largely focused on macro-economic aspects and national-level institutions and policies. Sub-national structures have received clearly less attention. We argue that institutions, power relations, and politics at the local and regional level play a major role in the resource curse and deserve more scholarly attention. We illustrate this argument with a case study of limestone mining in the Krobo region of Eastern Ghana. Rising natural resource revenues and their limited effects on peoples’ welfare render the resource curse debate particularly urgent in Ghana. Our qualitative in-depth case study, which combined interviews, focus groups and observations, aimed at analysing how traditional chieftaincy and district assemblies mediate peoples’ access to mining revenues. We found clear contradictions between national policies that aim at improving resource revenue transparency and welfare in mining-affected communities and realities on the ground. Culturally rooted chieftaincy power, chieftaincy conflicts, rulers’ self-interest, and unaccountable local institutions undermine peoples’ livelihoods, constrain their access to mining revenues and thereby impede poverty reduction and socio-economic development. The case highlights the central role that local institutions can play in the resource curse.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5
"This paper examines the inflation hedging ability of gold in the UK based on a fractional integration and cointegration framework. This gives more flexibility as it does not restrict the order of integration between zero and 1. Annual time series data covering 1257–2016 were used. We conducted both full sample and sub-sample analysis. Using the full sample, the findings shows that gold and retail price index (RPI) are both I(1). However, based on the sub-sample analyses, gold is I(1) for most sub-periods while RPI is mean reverting (d < 1) for most periods. However, both series exhibit the same degree of integration, I(1), during the last sub-sample, specifically between 1903 and 2016. We also find the existence of cointegration between gold and RPI but this is exclusively due to the data from the last century. It is therefore concluded that gold provides protection against inflation since its value would be maintained in the presence of inflation.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5

Moreover, after-hours information has a highly in-sample explanatory and there is no risk–return trade-off in the Chinese non-ferrous metals futures market. One-step ahead forecasts are investigated and the results indicated that the introduction of after-hours information and leverage effects in the HAR model exhibit better predictive power.

"It is difficult for almost all governments to combine efficient non-renewable natural resource production with effective capture of the resource rents. Governments must navigate between a “rock” of public sector extraction using relatively inefficient state-owned enterprises with considerable attendant rent dissipation and a “hard place” of private sector extraction with potential rent transfer or dissipation. We use the privatization of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (PCS) to illustrate this trade-off. We employ a “pre-post privatization” performance comparison to show that privatization did result in considerably improved PCS productive efficiency. We show, however, that Saskatchewan governments have been less successful at capturing significant resource rents following privatization. We consider some political economy explanations, including industry influence and an opaque rent tax regime that minimizes any negative electoral consequences of low rent appropriation. We discuss ways of increasing public rent capture: a more efficient and transparent rent tax regime, some share acquisition in potash firms (or specific projects) in order to provide a more accurate cost window on the industry, or some combination of a better tax regime and ownership.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5
"This paper compares the global markets for gold and oil so as to explain the surprisingly high correlation of the two materials’ prices since 1970, and the exceedingly impressive rise of both price series compared with that of virtually all other primary commodities. We propose that developments in the oil market, and the resulting effects on the macroeconomy, influenced investment activity in gold, thus providing the most plausible explanation for the two commodities’ price synchronization. Our view on the extraordinary price increases of oil and gold, compared to a broad category of metals and minerals, is that oil prices rose first based on above-ground hurdles that restrained the capacity to produce, and gold prices then reacted as they were pushed up by rising safe-haven investment to store value – an attribute not shared by other metals and minerals. The paper also comments on the likely future price evolution of these important materials, arguing that oil prices will stagnate at levels observed from late 2014, or even weaken in the coming decades, but that gold prices will continue to ride relatively high – thus leading to a collapse of the oil/gold price connection.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5
"As new technology is introduced, demand for certain materials will increase and demand for others will diminish. Base metal supply is generally elastic and can be expected to respond to demand. However, most minor metals—or “companion metals”—are coproduced with base metals and therefore have severely limited supply elasticity. If technological or societal change leads to a major demand reduction for a base metal, this could cause significant supply constraints for its companion metals.“Black swan” events are unexpected disruptions with major consequences. In this work, we show that not all companion metals behave the same when faced with a black swan base metal supply disruption, in our case Cu and Zn. We model the large-scale adoption of graphene for both electricity transport and corrosion protection, resulting in 25% and 33% reductions in demand over the 2025–2040 period for Cu and Zn, respectively. We find that companion metals fall into three categories: 1) the nuisance companion, 2) the low-volume companion, and 3) the profitable companion. Cadmium is an example of a nuisance companion, and as of 2014, half of the available Cd was discarded in some form rather than refined into metal. A supply disruption would lead to a reduced Cd oversupply but not to constraints. Germanium and indium are examples of low-volume companions and show a modest supply deficit of 20–50% in 2050 if confronted with a black swan event. Both elements face challenges in scaling up production significantly beyond current coproduction levels with Zn. Silver and molybdenum are profitable companions, and the overall market of these metals would only be moderately impacted by a black swan event (10–20% deficit) because other sources exist. These results indicate policy makers concerned about materials criticality should focus their limited resources on low-volume companion metals.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5

"At the mine approval phase, there is logically a focus on mine start-up and operational requirements, however, insufficient attention is given to rehabilitation planning aspects. To evaluate how rehabilitation planning is addressed upfront, we proposed a maturity model, which consists of three maturity performance indicators measured for seven environmental domain evaluative criteria. The maturity model, was applied to mine rehabilitation guidelines and mine approval consultant rehabilitation reports in South Africa and Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. We found that these documents were vulnerable to adequate, but not yet resilient, i.e. rehabilitation information was gathered, but seldom analysed, with limited integration and rehabilitation risk determination. Legislation, as well as the temporary and dynamic nature of mining, may inadvertently be contributing to immaturity. We conclude by discussing ways forward and the need to determine upfront, a site's total rehabilitation failure risk, as an aid to improving rehabilitation planning.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5

"Social licence to operate (SLO) has become an important part of the natural resource management discourse, particularly in relation to contested arenas. The social accountability constituted by SLO requires engagement and relationship-building efforts, which are increasingly prescribed to include ‘meaningful dialogue’ as central. How such dialogue translates into practice has been subject to little research in the SLO context. To examine explicitly the role of dialogue in strategies to address SLO, we present, using an interdisciplinary lens, a conceptual framework. We characterise two dialogue models relevant to SLO from the literature on dialogue: a learning model and a strategic model. We then analyse how these models arise in five engagement frameworks drawn from academic and grey literature. We assess how these frameworks situate, conceptualise, and seek to operationalise dialogue. This analysis highlights key themes that indicate that dialogue in SLO is predominantly portrayed as a goal-oriented, strategic process – rather than a learning and relationship-building process, though in both models dialogue can have a disruptive role. Conceptual clarity is needed, however, as dialogue sometimes refers to a process, sometimes to an outcome, and sometimes to an aspiration. Clarifying what dialogue is and what it can achieve are needed to guide future research and practice.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5
"The recent oil price shocks of 2014 resulted in a substantial economic slowdown in the oil-exporting countries of the Caspian Basin, namely Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. These resource-reliant countries have encountered a contraction not only in the commodity sector, but also in the non-oil sector due to poor diversification of the economy, and cuts in budget expenditure amid plunging oil prices. By analyzing the underlying causes of the current crisis, this paper concludes that, the economies of these countries are “subsidized economies”, or based on government spending financed by resource windfalls. The non-resource sectors in these oil-exporting countries were poorly developed prior to the crisis and failed to act as an avenue for diversification, lacking the potential to be export-oriented and sustainable.

"The mineral industry generally operates in remote territories where lifestyles are often unrelated to the logic of the global market and the infrastructure and institutions are fragile. These conditions increase the complexity of the impact of mining. Thus, the sustainability of the industry must consider the social perceptions of local communities. This article focuses on social perceptions at the start of operations of the S11D iron mine — currently the largest in operation in the world — located in the municipality of Canaã dos Carajás, southeast Pará state, Eastern Amazonia. The methodology of the study involves the use of questionnaires, administered in 2015 to a stratified sample of 253 households of the central district of the municipality. The analysis identifies the role that differences in gender, origin, time of arrival in the city, and a person's occupation have on perceptions. The results show high acceptance — with 83% of the respondents perceiving the mining positively — indicating concession of a social license to operate, mainly due to opportunities for work and income and the increase in both activity in the city and the collection of taxes and fees. Negative aspects were poor public management, environmental degradation, and a fear of fleeting prosperity. Perceptions were most favorable among those who had recently arrived in the city — people who are still hoping to socially integrate — and those who arrived a long time ago and are already embedded in the local context. The population consists of migrants who settled in the territory at the same time as the industry. Therefore, unlike other contexts dealt with in the literature, there is no conflict between the community and the project. The challenge for the mining company and the public authorities in converting the mineral assets into sustainable local development, especially through more efficient management of the city, remains.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5
"This paper explores the opportunities for innovation and diversification that can be opened in association to mining activities in developing countries. In particular, the paper focuses on Knowledge Intensive Mining Suppliers (KIMS) in Chile. Using case study methodology, results show that Chilean KIMS firms entered dynamic segments of the Chilean copper value chain either by customizing products and services to local productive specific conditions or by utilizing new technologies as a platform to develop unique solutions to unresolved mining problems. In the former case, Chilean KIMS are small to large firms with a family origin which entered consolidated markets dominated by large international supplies, whereas in the latter one these suppliers are small young firms which were created as scientific or corporate spin-offs that opened new market niches. Linkages with leading mining firms that governed the mining value chain have been crucial for Chilean KIMS to learn about industry needs. However, there is no evidence that indicates that these linkages have been significant in helping local suppliers to construe their technological and innovative capabilities. Instead, Chilean KIMS innovated in isolation and only occasionally received technological assistance from extra-industry organizations. Experimentation in mine sites is the most important bottleneck for Chilean KIMS´ innovation strategy. Governments seeking to support the expansion of KIMS need a good understanding of these companies’ innovation trajectory, competitive environment, threats, risks and opportunities.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5
"Industrial clusters last if they can maintain over time the competitive advantages arisen from external economies and joint actions developed in the cluster itself. The trend towards relocation of activities outside the cluster, in other geographical areas, may be restrained by a number of inhibiting factors or barriers relating to the exit or abandonment of the cluster, such as the sense of belonging to the cluster, the density of the network of relationships established, the existence of shared norms and values, and the institutional framework of the cluster. Thus, the greater the presence of these factors is, the lower companies’ trend to leave the cluster will be. This paper analyses the cluster perpetuation model, based on the calculation of the probability of activity relocation, applied to the Antofagasta (Chile) mining cluster, using a multiple binary logistic regression.",Volume 54,December 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/54/suppl/C,5
"Resource nationalism is often cited as the most serious risk to foreign mining investment in developing countries. Mongolia provides an important case study of studying this phenomenon and its impacts, especially during the global mining boom years from the late 1990s to 2010. This phenomenon has been exposed mainly through the ever increasing role of state ownership in major mineral deposits, mostly by direct equity participation. The rationale behind these nationalist policies is to maximize the economic and political benefits from extractive industries. However, in reality, the Mongolian government lacks financial and human resources as well as practical knowledge to engage directly in mega projects which pose substantial risks, if carried out improperly. The aim of this paper is to examine the underlying nature of the state-centric resource development model in Mongolia. Using an institutionalist approach, the study provides a systematic understanding of the root causes for the growing state involvements in mineral resource development, and its implications for and implementation upon the Mongolian mining sector, including major challenges encountered as a result of the dominant ownership structures shaping the industry.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"Raw materials form the basis of Europe's economy to ensure jobs and competitiveness, and they are essential for maintaining and improving quality of life. Although all raw materials are important, some of them are of more concern than others, thus the list of critical raw materials (CRMs) for the EU, and the underlying European Commission (EC) criticality assessment methodology, are key instruments in the context of the EU raw materials policy.For the next update of the CRMs list in 2017, the EC is considering to apply the overall methodology already used in 2011 and 2014, but with some modifications. Keeping the same methodological approach is a deliberate choice in order to prioritise the comparability with the previous two exercises, effectively monitor trends, and maintain the highest possible policy relevance. As the EC's in-house science service, the Directorate General Joint Research Centre (DG JRC) identified aspects of the EU criticality methodology that could be adapted to better address the needs and expectations of the resulting CRMs list to identify and monitor critical raw materials in the EU.The goal of this paper is to discuss the specific elements of the EC criticality methodology that were adapted by DG JRC, highlight their novelty and/or potential outcomes, and discuss them in the context of criticality assessment methodologies available internationally.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"The evaluation of coupling coordination has great significance to find the “short plank” of resources and environment carrying capacity. A combination of subjective and objective weighting methods, comprehensive evaluation method and coupling coordination model are used to evaluate the coupling coordination degree and search for the “short plank” of resources and environment carrying capacity in Chinese mining economic zones. The results show that: (1) All mining economic zones are in the state of unbalanced development, and most of them are in the state of moderately unbalanced development. (2) Western mining economic zones are in the better state of coupling coordination, and the eastern zones follow. (3) Most mining economic zones lag behind in water resources, and obvious geographical features exist in the “short plank”.

"Rare earth elements (REEs), which include the lanthanides, yttrium, and scandium, have been the focus of several studies in recent years due to their contribution to modern technology (e.g. screens of smart phones, computers, and flat panel televisions; batteries of hybrid and electric cars), China's dominance in production and consumption, and to the international dependence on China for most of the world's REE supply.The aim of this study is two-fold. First, to offer a historical perspective of the REE market by constructing and analyzing time series of consumption, production, and oxide/metal prices. Such series are mostly non-existent (e.g., consumption) or scattered across different sources (e.g., prices). Second, to provide a financial perspective of the REE market by gauging the market capitalization and systematic risk of leading companies involved in exploration, production and processing of REEs worldwide; and, by measuring co-movement of REE prices and commodity indices. We contribute to the existing literature by providing a thorough overview of the REE market.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"The social license to operate, as promoted within the fields of corporate social responsibility and impact assessment studies, has entered the business mainstream, especially in the mining and extractives sector. While it is invoked increasingly as a means of claiming legitimacy, the concept remains conflicted, implying that the social license terrain may be more complex and broader than conventional conceptualizations suggest.In this paper the authors draw attention to a suite of licenses and related risks that shape the issues surrounding mining and extractives companies’ quest for a social license to operate. These are captured in a holistic license and risk model, the social, actuarial and political risk and licensing model (SAP Model). Drawing on research from corporate social responsibility and impact assessment studies fields, the paper introduces the SAP Model and suggests how it enables improved exploration of the meaning, intention and probable implications of the various licenses and associated risks facing the mining and extractives sector. In so doing, it contributes a more contextualized understanding of social license to operate, especially for the corporate social responsibility and impact assessment fields of research.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"We found mixed evidence regarding quantile causality from gold commodity to gold stock returns for global, regional and individual country gold stock price indices. More specifically, gold prices Granger-caused Australian gold stock returns in all quantiles, but there was no quantile causality for either gold stock returns for companies located in the Europe-Middle East-Africa regions or the upper quantiles of companies located in America. In contrast, we found consistent evidence of quantile causality from gold stock returns to gold prices. These results would indicate that gold price shocks do not translate directly into wealth shocks for gold companies and that investors and risk managers could use the information regarding gold commodity and gold stock prices to improve decision making.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"China was in the past the main driver when analysing rare earth prices and their market, since it commercialised around the 90% of the world's supply. After a cut in its exports during 2010 and 2011, rare earth prices dramatically spiked. The world's reaction to this fact was the development of a huge amount of mining projects outside China, many of whom failed when prices fell again. Nevertheless, several of them survived.This paper analyses in first place the future trend of rare earth elements prices in order to contrast the stable tendency forecasted by different providers of price assessments and market data. Secondly, it studies in deep five ready-to-go rare earths mining projects around the world: Nechalacho Project (North-west Territories, Canada); Zandkopsdrift Project (Northern Cape, South Africa); Bear Lodge Project (Wyoming, USA); Kvanefjeld Project (Southern Greenland); and Dubbo Zirconia Project (New South Wales, Australia). The main purposes being to give an “order of magnitude” both technical and economic of this specific mining industry; to provide a tool for investors, potential investors and professional advisers addressing rare earth mining investment analysis; and to facilitate the development of preliminary economic assessments of future rare earth mining projects. These aims will also help to fight against several systemic problems of the rare earth market: lack of trust, market opacity, and short versus long-term approaches and profit orientation.Conclusions clearly show that despite the complexity of rare earth mineral deposits and the fact that their mining operation usually includes different by-products, the evaluation of rare earth mining investments does not present much more difficulty than in the case of single element mining projects. Forecasted prices used in these economic studies are the Achilles’ heel of nowadays rare earth mining investment analysis.Finally, although differences in demand of different rare earth elements will make really difficult to achieve “a priori” a market in balance, the five studied projects are anticipated to cover approximately the third part of the total rare earth consumption in the world. When their dysprosium oxide production was analysed, the resulting proportion for the most critical rare earth element based on its role in clean energy together with its biggest supply risk was almost the same, something optimistic regarding the achievement of a balanced market outside China.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"The primary objective of this paper is to explore the main factors driving CO2 emissions in China's mining industry and its subsectors. By utilizing the Log-Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method, this paper decomposes changes in energy-related CO2 emissions into an industrial scale effect, an energy intensity effect, an energy structure effect, and a CO2 emissions coefficient effect in both the overall mining industry and its subsectors. The main results indicate that (1) CO2 emissions in China's mining industry rose by approximately 95.74 million tons during 2000–2014. The mining and washing of coal (MWC) and the extraction of petroleum and natural gas (EPNG) were the top two emitters, accounting for approximately 80% of total CO2 emissions in China's mining industry. (2) From the overall mining industry perspective, the industrial scale effect made the largest contribution to increasing CO2 emissions, while the energy intensity effect was the most important factor in reducing CO2 emissions. Additionally, the energy structure effect played a small role in inhibiting CO2 emissions. (3) From the subsector perspective, the industrial scale effect increased CO2 emissions in five subsectors, especially the MWC, while the energy intensity effect was the dominant factor inhibiting CO2 emissions in the five subsectors. The energy structure effect impacted CO2 emissions negatively in the EPNG, the MWC and the mining and processing of non-ferrous metal ores (MPNFMO); it impacted CO2 emissions positively in the mining and processing of ferrous metal ores (MPFMO) and the mining and processing of non-metal ores (MPNO). Policy recommendations related to energy intensity and energy structure adjustments were provided.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6

Further, all the stock markets (except for Japanese market) are a source of volatility spillovers and the four precious metal markets are net receipt of volatility spillovers during the Global Financial Crisis and European Sovereign Debt Crisis.

"Geodiversity can be defined as either number of geological heritage types or qualitative characteristics of the unique geological environment. Geodiversity can be used for the purposes of science, education, and tourism, and, thus, this is a precious resource requiring efficient exploitation for production of socio-economic benefits. Geoparks are ideal instruments of the geodiversity resource exploitation. Their efficacy on the international scale is clear, but their role in countries is yet to be discussed. The assessment of the dominant geological heritage types in all geoparks (members of the UNESCO Global Geoparks) of seven countries with their big number (China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the United Kingdom) suggest that about a half of the known types are represented in the geoparks of each of these countries. However, the exploitation of the geodiversity resource on the national level is not full because some types are missed and those available differ by the relative importance. It appears that the UNESCO Global Geopark network does not match the national interests ideally (partly because the UNESCO initiative is not aimed at the national level by definition). It is recommended that countries should develop their own policy of efficient geodiversity resource exploitation via geopark creation. As much geological heritage types as possible should be represented in geoparks, and the very ideas of geodiversity and geoparks should be promoted actively among the broad public and the policy-makers.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"Since the turn of the century, Greenland has been examining the possibilities to develop its potential oil and gas resources. The large scale oil and gas activities will impact the small Greenlandic society, both positively and negatively. In this paper we employ the concept of a social license to operate to address the risks of an activity, represented by the acceptance or approval of an activity by societal actors. The focus of existing research is primarily on the interaction between local communities and companies. However, in an increasingly complex society, where the role of governments, companies and civil society is subject to constant change, social licenses to operate should be studied in an integrated way, to deal with all essential elements that influence the successful implementation of controversial activities.This paper builds on the idea that successful implementation of an activity is determined by social, political and legal licenses. Trust and legitimacy are regarded as the fundamental principles on which all three licenses are based. This paper therefore adopts an integrated approach, in which the role of the political and legal licenses is taken into account as well as the social license. This approach provides for a more thorough analysis for different sources of personal and institutionalised trust as well as input, throughput and output legitimacy across the three licenses. The case study also illustrates the potential role of the government in co-shaping a social license to operate.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6

However, using fractional techniques, we show that there exists a fractionally cointegrated relationship between the two variables, with an order of integration in the long run relationship of about 0.46.

"The neglect of the welfare of host communities in the current mining practice is partly due to the lack of a defensible measurement of the impacts of coal mining on host communities. Subjective indicators, superior to the traditionally used objective indicators in terms of informing policy makers of public preference, are barely used in mining impact assessment. The objective of this study is to illustrate approaches to use subjective data to investigate the impacts of coal mining. It looks at how satisfied people are with multiple wellbeing factors, what matters most/least to people, and at their perception of the impact that coal mining has on these factors. Comparisons are made between location categories characterized with different intensities of coal mining. Two composite indices that blends responses to questions about satisfaction and importance/perceived impacts of coal mining are constructed to identify policy priorities. The general and pervasive message is that coal mining does not seem to improve subjective satisfaction with those wellbeing factors, instead, it has negative impacts on a wide range of wellbeing factors pertaining to the natural environment and the economy. This paper supplies references for public policy to improve local wellbeing, and demonstrates approaches to use subjective data.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"This study examines the hypothesis of Tilton et al. (2011) that asserts investor demand affects commodity prices when spot and futures prices are closely correlated during strong contango in a hard commodity like copper. However, using daily data of crude palm oil (CPO) spot and futures prices from January 2000 to July 2016, after taking into account the variance of the increments in a random walk as measured by variance ratio, our study finds that spot and futures prices are highly correlated during backwardation period. It is further observed that: First, investor demand on the futures market is highly correlated with spot and futures prices during backwardation, but lesser during weak contango, and the least correlated during strong contango. Second, the efficiency of the futures market is related to the degree of correlation between spot and futures price changes. High efficient information transmission in the futures market is linked to a high correlation between spot and futures markets and vice versa. Therefore, we extend the hypothesis that the preference of holding a long position in the futures market is due to the anticipation of insufficient supply of CPO which happens during the backwardation period.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"This paper examines the resource curse hypothesis both within and between countries of different democratic footprint, based on a dynamic model that properly accounts for endogeneity issues. To achieve that, we apply a panel Vector Auto-Regressive (PVAR) approach along with panel impulse response functions to data on oil dependence variables, economic growth and several political institutional variables in 76 countries classified by different income groupings and level of development, over the period 1980–2012. Our results suggest that controlling for the quality of political institutions, and in particular the constraints to the executives, is important in rendering the resource curse hypothesis significant. Doing so, the resource curse hypothesis is documented mainly for developing economies and medium-high income countries. Specifically, when economies from the aforementioned groups are characterised by weak quality of political institutions, then oil dependence is not growth-enhancing.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"It is expected that possessing the natural resources could faster increases the pace of growth in natural resource endowed countries. However, history has shown that this is not the case for some resource rich countries. In the current study, hence, we assess whether more developed financial markets can channel the revenues from oil into more productive activities and thus offset the negative effects of oil abundance on growth. To this end, we adopt the common correlated effect mean group estimator to account for the high degree of heterogeneity (because of substantial cross-sectional dependence in our data) for a core sample of 63 oil-producing countries from 1980 through 2010. The empirical results show that oil abundance affects the growth rate in output based on the degree of development in financial markets. In other words, better financial development dampens the negative impact of oil abundance on economic growth.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6

In addition to these introductory contributions, the main are threefold: the reconfiguration of existing indicators criticality to the French case; the proposal of a new complementary criticality indicator to the Commission's two and which takes into account not only the upstream market of the material but also its downstream processing by the economy; finally the definition of high and low criticality allows to generate twelve indicators and variants (four strong(s) and eight low) from the two previous points and subjected to robustness checks.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"This paper forms part of the growing body of scholarly research that seeks to understand the impacts of extractive activities on local and indigenous communities. The paper examines the socio-economic impacts of large-scale mining activity on rural livelihoods in four villages (Armoede, Ga-Chaba Ga-Molekana and Skeming) in the Mapela traditional authority area where Anglo Platinum’s Mogalakwena mine is operating. Of these four villages, only Armoede residents were relocated while the other three villages remain within the proximity of the mine. As a result of co-habitation and proximity to production, the three villages also highlight another important dimension of mining-induced displacement and resettlement whereby mining activities encroach on the livelihoods of surrounding villages. Rural households in the Mapela area have traditionally relied on both agricultural and non-agricultural sources of income, often straddling urban and rural locales, in highly diversified livelihood systems for both survival and accumulation purposes. The establishment of large-scale mining investments in peripheral localities may be seen as constituting part of the mediating processes between the households and the wider socio-economic context which may enhance or diminish their livelihood assets or endowments. Findings from this research reveal that mining-related land dispossessions have had adverse impacts on land-based and agrarian livelihood activities namely, homestead garden cultivation, ploughing in large fields and livestock rearing. This happens within the context of limited non-farm livelihood opportunities, especially wage employment, both locally and in the wider economy. In this sense, large-scale mining investment disrupts the local livelihood system, intensifying the crisis of social reproduction amongst local rural households and limiting their ability to accumulate, especially from agriculture. This raises critical questions about the role and place of agricultural forms of livelihood in the contemporary capitalist world where the historical role of industrial growth as a means of eradicating poverty has also become highly uncertain.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6

With these developments bring out new challenges on mainly construction materials. Hence, many studies ultimately reporting various waste management strategies which involves both eco efficient parameters. In the row, recent studies have been paid their focus on the construction materials which includes fine and course aggregates. Generally, the existing studies focused on alternatives for these construction aggregates, but still there is enough room to explore further. Hence, this study considers as an opportunity to investigate the effect of using alternatives for both fine and course aggregates with copper slag (30%, 40% and 50%), iron slag (30%, 40% and 50%)and recycled concrete aggregate (20%, 25% and 30%) with various proportions of mix by the partial replacement of sand and gravel respectively.

"This paper explores the potential risks related to the resource curse for Guinea-Bissau. To date, the country is not yet a producer of extractive resources, but its potential is high and investments are materialising. Cognisant of this, the authorities set mining/extractive industries as a core tenet of the national strategic and operational plan laid out in 2015. Risks analysed in this paper relate on the one hand to potential resource curse effects (e.g., enclave and Dutch disease), and on the other to the challenge of public financial management (PFM) and transformation of revenue into investments. Using a governance and PFM prism as analysis framework, the paper finds gaps between the de jure and de facto governance framework related to extractives. Stemming from this, policy responses are looked at including key reforms in anticipation of extractive revenues such as strengthening of PFM systems and the budget process in particular, and investing in transparency through avenues combining bottom-up (e.g., local civil society) and top-down (e.g., international compacts) approaches.

"Since the beginning of this century, another new wave of resource nationalism with unprecedented high frequency and wide area had been profoundly affecting natural resources industry's room of development. It attracted increased attention among researchers and business investors. Numerous descriptive case studies on the issue indicated us how specific economic, political and other factors interacted and further drove resource nationalism strategy and policy making. However, as far as we know, none of them were able to quantitatively dig out the mutual factors across countries that work uniformly in producing resource nationalism. The objective of the study is quantifying significant factors dominating the occurrence of resource nationalism for important metal and energy resources producing countries at global level by binary choice logit model for panel data.

"This article examines the social management capability (SMC) of the global mining industry to identify, understand and manage complex social and environmental issues, such as human migration. Our contribution is based on the analysis and interpretation of two sets of qualitative data: (i) existing literature on SMCs and its relevance to demographic pressures in mining, and (ii) a series of industry-commissioned “deep dives” exploring high profile legacy cases. These sources provide a coherent picture of how the mining industry has positioned itself in responding to contentious social and environmental challenges. Our findings suggest that, considering the dynamic nature of human migration issues like in-migration and resettlement, the industry does not have sufficiently robust SMCs. The absence of these SMCs has resulted in ad-hoc strategies for managing high risk, high cost issues. In concluding, we argue that a major step change is needed within the industry in terms of developing and then rapidly advancing its SMCs.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"The Social Licence to Operate (SLO) is increasingly used in extractive industries both as a response to calls for greater community engagement and as a corporate sustainability strategy. Given its current popularity as a policy instrument, critiques on the SLO deserve attention. Critiques mainly focus on ambiguities that surround the processes of granting and maintaining the SLO. This article explores the negative social and environmental impacts that these ambiguities may obscure from sight. It applies a critical research approach to a case study of the diversion of the river Undai as part of the Oyu Tolgoi mining project in Mongolia and the associated construction of a SLO. The results show that neutralising discourses obscured harmful impact on nature and society. Moreover, the SLO was intimately entwined with changes in the landscape and livelihood strategies that had a harmful effect on both the livelihoods and the social identity of herders. The analysis thus validates existing critiques on the SLO and calls for more authentic engagement with local communities that specifically includes the recognition of harm.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"The demand for many resources has increased significantly over the last decades due to their growing importance for industrial and technological development. Thus, various methods were developed to assess availability constraints of resources in relation to their vulnerability within countries and/or sectors (criticality). However, these methods display several short-comings. Thus, the aim of the introduced approach is, to enhance the assessment of critical resource use on country level with the SCARCE method, by considering the two dimensions criticality (with the sub dimensions availability and vulnerability) and societal acceptance (with the sub dimensions compliance with social standards and compliance with environmental standards). For five of the 12 introduced categories measuring availability constraints the country specific import mix is used to determine availability constraints of resources individually for the country under consideration. These results can further be compared with global constraints (which are calculated based on global production data) to determine if the country under consideration performs worse or better than the global average. To measure social aspects the categories small scale mining, geopolitical risk and human rights abuse are introduced. Environmental aspects are considered within the categories sensitivity of the local biodiversity, climate change and water scarcity. Additionally, next to metals also fossil fuels are included allowing a direct comparison of both abiotic resources. The SCARCE method is applied for the case study of Germany for which criticality results are presented and their plausibility is validated. It is shown that for Germany tungsten is the raw material showing high risks in all considered dimensions excluding the sub dimension vulnerability. Its high availability constraints are defined by the categories political stability, primary material use and price fluctuations. Further, due to the countries tungsten is imported from (e.g. Bolivia), its compliance with social and environmental standards is low. To enhance the applicability of the SCARCE method, indicator results are provided for 40 resources to assess their availability constraints as well as their compliance with social and environmental standards.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"The emerging financialization of commodity markets over the last decades has led to an intense public and scientific debate about commodity investing and its implications. Although metal commodities are indispensable to industry and the economy, the influence of financialization on metal spot prices and in particular on respective volatility has been insufficiently studied. Therefore, we attempt to contribute to existing literature by examining potential effects of the lead-lag relationship on futures trading activity of commercial and non-commercial market participants and cash prices and volatility for the major metal commodities: copper, gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. After analyzing Commitment of Traders (COT) reports from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over a timeframe from January 1993 to December 2013, bi-directional Granger-causality tests and an EGARCH volatility analysis show that there is hardly any influence of trading activity driving metal spot prices in the long-term, but rather driving volatility to some extent. We find indications of price and volatility influencing effects of trading activity within sub-samples, such as phases of booms and crises. Contrary to public perception, commercial and long positions affect price levels and volatility far more than activities of non-commercial traders. However, for the reverse direction there is strong evidence that commodity prices and volatility drive trading positions.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"Coal as the basic energy in China plays a pivotal role in supporting national economic development and protecting national energy safety. The sustainable development of China's coal industry is still a hot topic both in practice and research. In terms of the lack of theoretical researches and practical applications of scientific coal mining evaluation, we built an evaluating system to assess the current development activities of coal enterprises. In the present work, to evaluate the scientific basis for coal mining systematically, effectively and objectively, the key indexes for assessing the level of scientific mining of coal resources were established using the document analysis method and the expert consultation method. The evaluating system consisting of 5 dimensions (informatization, productivity, safe mining, full cost and green mining), 18 criteria, and 56 assessment factors was constructed. Then, the weight values at all levels in the evaluating system were calculated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Finally, an evaluating model for scientific mining could be constructed based on the comprehensive index assessment method. The application of this evaluating system of scientific mining could be used for finding the existing problems in the coal production process. Therefore, the coal enterprise managers and the government regulators could make the appropriate policies to enhance the scientific exploitation level of coal mines.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"Fiscal regimes to the mining industry facilitate the revenue-raising task of resource-dependent economies as they reduce the local tax burden of their residents. Whether these fiscal arrangements translate into a higher allocation of public goods in these economies remains yet unclear. We analyze the effects that local mineral taxation has on the provision of public goods in mining communities using Chile as a case study. We examine the effects of a non-distortionary tax on local concessions using a panel of 345 local governments between 2009 and 2014. To identify the effect, we compare the benefits of the tax on mining localities using two counterfactual groups of non-mining localities. We control for time-invariant and time-variant unobservable factors through both a fixed-effects and an instrumental variable fixed-effects estimator. Results show that the mineral tax increases the provision of only two out of four indicators of public goods. Further evidence suggests that local mineral taxation crowds out other local taxes.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"This paper uses the Generalized Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (Phillips et al., 2011) to examine whether there are multiple bubbles in iron ore price. The proposed method is convenient for a practical implementation of a time series and recognizes the initiation and termination of multiple bubbles. The empirical results indicate that four bubbles existed from January 1980 to December 2016 and that iron ore prices diverge from their intrinsic values based on market fundamentals. Through analyses, the first three bubbles can be explained by excess demand from China, persistent supply constraint, a high level of industry concentration and an annual benchmark pricing mechanism. The last bubble is mainly attributed to the negative influence from the global financial crisis in 2008. Therefore, the authorities should actively recognize bubbles and observe their evolutions, which favor iron ore price stabilization. These findings have important economic and policy implications derived from investigations of reasons for bubbles and assume corresponding measures to reduce the impact on the real economy due to the fluctuation in iron ore price.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"Social Licence to Operate (SLO) has become an important part of discourse in the extractive industries. It has been argued that attaining a social licence requires meaningful stakeholder engagement and, more specifically, dialogue. The links between social licence and dialogue have not been the subject of much research in the resource context. To address this gap, we examined empirically the perceptions of stakeholder engagement practitioners involved in the extractives industries regarding the outcomes that can result from dialogue in SLO engagement processes. Dialogue, when meaningful, was seen to potentially result in sixteen outcomes some of which were trust, relationships, perceptions of fairness, social acceptance, shared decision-making, and legitimacy. Many of these outcomes have previously been proposed to be integral to the development of SLO in both the academic and popular literature. This article, then, offers a synthesis of and an empirical foundation for such recommendations, and in doing so can inform the design of engagement strategies. We also offer a conceptual contribution to the social licence literature by proposing that some of these central factors of SLO, and outcomes of dialogue, be reconceptualised to add a layer of depth to our understanding of processes in this context. Finally, this investigation reveals areas that future research and development of practice in SLO stakeholder engagement can address.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"DRC's 2002 Mining Code has attracted Large-Scale Mining (LSM) through favorable fiscal conditions, but is detrimental to Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM). The Code specifies that ASM should take place in Artisanal Exploitation Zones (AEZ), but far too few AEZ were created to accommodate the large number of artisanal miners. This has triggered an explosive situation, as many artisanal miners operate in mining concessions granted to LSM companies. While LSM companies justify their operations referring to statutory law, miners claim traditional rights to the land. We study how this situation of legal pluralism plays out in Kamituga, a gold mining area in South-Kivu. To what extent do the artisanal miners and the LSM company stick to their opposing frames of reference? To what extent do they look for compromises? Can these compromises give way to the re-making of institutions?",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"Policy-makers and legislators, typically representing a government body, are quick to impose royalties and other measures to secure income from natural resources operations. While this is undeniably appropriate, the question that is seldom asked by the same regulators is what impact does such an imposition beyond profit-based taxes have on the actual operation. Through taking away a percentage of the revenue that would otherwise have been due to the operation, what will the royalty do to the Resources-base, to the economic life of the operation, or to employment at the operation in the longer term? What royalty rate is optimal, being at what rate the operator pays and the government receives an equitable amount of revenue, and beyond what rate will the impact raise the possibility that the operator decides to discontinue operating? This paper introduces and quantifies a number of the impacts, including resources sterilisation, associated with royalties in the resources sector, using a gold operation as an example to outline the consequences of royalties based on revenue.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"The article presents findings derived from the benchmarking comparison of four mining companies extracting hard coal in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin located on the boarder of the Czech Republic and Poland: OKD a.s. operating in the Czech Republic and three Polish entities Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa S. A. (JSW), Katowicki Holding Węglowy S. A., and Kompania Węglowa S. A. Although all companies extract the same mineral resource in analogous mining-geological conditions, their economic results differ significantly. The article benchmarks the mining companies in a 5-year period: from 2009 to 2014. Six financial indicators were used in order to achieve the goal: ROE, ROS, ROA, Debt to Equity Ratio, Assets Turnover, and Cash Flow Liquidity Ratio. In addition, the standard variable method was used together with Fuller's method to determine the weights of the different criteria. The benchmarking results, based on the values of integral ratio, show JSW as the leading company in 2009, while in 2014 Czech OKD gained the prime position. In general, during the 5-year observation period, JSW achieved the best financial results. The study presents JSW as the benchmarking leader due to the best performance achieved among the four mining companies extracting hard coal in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin positioned in Central-Eastern Europe.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"Open pit mine planning and determination of mining orientation are a critically important part of a mine opening to its closure. However, an optimal extraction sequences (OES) is identified when an NPV cumulative trend becomes steady. This is controlled manually, typically from a nested pit shell methodology based on the experience which can lead to suboptimal results. Given this problem, a mathematical method to provide an analytical practice, which intends to prevent manual identification of an OES seems to be inevitable. The aim of this study is to propose Present Value-Volume (PV-V) and NPV-Cumulative Total Ore (NPV-CTO) fractal models to identify an accurate excavation orientation as well as an OES with respect to economic principals and ore grades. This has been conducted to achieve an earlier pay-back period and highest cumulative NPV in Kahang Cu-Mo porphyry deposit, central Iran. Results derived via the PV-V fractal modelling indicate an accurate mining orientation with an N-S trend. Thus, pit sequence No. 92 was selected as the closure of the open pit mining for the Kahang deposit. Consequently, the NPV-CTO fractal model provides an analytical tool which can be used for determination of an OES for an open pit mine.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"Against a backdrop of decarbonisation in the energy sector and the increasing share of nuclear power in the global power mix, availability of uranium resources presents a major challenge. Since it will be some time before technologies of future nuclear reactors which remove the reliance on natural uranium are fully deployed, it is relevant to analyse the availability conditions for uranium in the 21st century.The first two conditions - technical accessibility and economic value - are associated with production cost. We study these by modelling the ultimate uranium resources (including both identified and undiscovered resources) and their cost. This method is based on a regional breakdown of global uranium resources, current known deposits and an economic filter. It allows us to establish a long-term supply curve in which the quantities of technically accessible uranium resources are represented as a function of production cost.The other uranium availability conditions considered are associated with market dynamics, which created by the relationship between supply and demand. These are modelled in the form of dynamic constraints in a partial equilibrium market model. This is a deterministic model in which the market players are represented by regions. It allows us to take account, for instance, of the short-term correlation between price and exploration expenditure. In the longer term, the constraints modelled include anticipation of demand from electric utilities (the consumers) and the increasing scarcity of the least costly ultimate resources.Using a series of forward looking simulations, we demonstrate that the rate of growth in demand for uranium in the 21st century and its anticipation have a major impact on the increase in price in the long-term. Conversely, uncertainties related to the estimation of ultimate resources have a limited effect. Lastly, some variations in supply (uranium production shutdown in a particular region, for example) or demand (irregular increase) also have a significant impact on long-term price trends or cycles.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"Underground mining in China has incited severe land subsidence causing the forced eviction of millions of farmers. Here we report on one of the earliest Chinese studies on Mining-Induced Displacement and Resettlement (MIDR), based on a farm household survey (n = 230) and semi-structured interviews (n = 29) in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Chongqing and Hunan. It was found that displaced farmers were overall insufficiently compensated for mining-induced damage. Respondents expressed concerns over higher living costs in the relocation villages, and were ill-informed about resettlement schemes. We also found widespread conflict between farmers, mining companies and local government, this being the case in over two-thirds of the surveyed villages. Through additional institutional analysis it is ascertained that existing policies and laws predominantly focus on surface rather than underground mining. Compensation is rarely provided unless damage to land and housing has grown to unmanageable proportions. In result, displacement and resettlement is generally chosen as a sole, yet, final solution. The study includes cases on coal, lead, zinc and manganese. Based on the analysis, we call for a revision of mining policies and the establishment of state-supported compensation schemes in order to minimize conflict and farmers’ socio-economic vulnerability.",Volume 53,September 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/53/suppl/C,6
"A world class mineral resource industry can concisely be defined as an industry with standard-setting excellence in terms of quality, performance, production of market specified rock products and client satisfaction when compared with all other similar industrial sectors from anywhere in the world. The mineral resource industry has always been acknowledged worldwide as the foundation in the design and the construction of various innovative structures, infrastructures and amenities aimed towards global society enhancement. This economic sector is thus the vital catalyst and component of any country worldwide striving for developed, high-income and industrialised nation status. A sustainable mineral industry, which includes the mining and quarrying sectors, aims to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of the future generation to meet their own needs. World leaders are in agreement that accountability, quality assurance complemented by environmental-friendly and occupational safe work practices are an asset towards a successful sustainability initiative. The updated National Mineral Policy (NMP2), an improvement of the original 1993 National Mineral Policy (NMP1), was strategically drawn-up by the Malaysian Government with the aim towards the systematic sustainable development of Malaysia's mineral resource potential in a globalised market. The revised National Mineral Policy (NMP2) and regulatory framework aims to create a more conducive, transparent and environmental-friendly economic climate to encourage more potential investors to confidently support and further develop the Malaysian mineral resource industry towards world class status and also help contribute towards further economic growth of the nation and society. This article focuses on the major aspects and regulatory framework of the updated National Mineral Policy 2 (NMP2) complemented by discussions on the effectiveness and challenges faced in its implementation towards successful mineral resource sustainability for Malaysia.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Reliance on classical valuation methods such as the net present value (NPV) has often resulted in controversial asset valuations in the mining sector. An alternative method, termed decoupled net present value (DNPV), is used to evaluate mining investment opportunities. The proposed valuation method decouples the time value of money from the risk associated with the project providing a consistent valuation method free from the problems typically associated with the application of NPV. Market risks (e.g., commodity prices, foreign exchange) can be systematically combined with non-market risks (e.g., effect on operations of climate change and/or large earthquakes). More importantly, DNPV allows seamless integration of project risk assessment performed by technical experts and risk management implemented by business executives into the financial evaluation of the project. A simplified mining investment project is analyzed using traditional techniques and compared with the proposed DNPV. The example includes a discussion about how valuation is affected by climate change and earthquake risks, and how investment in resilience and adaption can be incorporated in the proposed analysis.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between the exploitation of saline lake mineral resources and ecological system, providing decision-making references in terms of socioeconomic development and environment protection. Using system dynamics (SD), the study comes with a systematic analysis of the interdependence among saline lake mineral resources, the ecological environment and socioeconomic development as well as the trend of development in the future. Take the relationship between the saline lake mineral resources and the development of economic and the ecological system of Qinghai province for example. According to the model of study, as of 2020, proved reserves of saline lake mines in the region will only increase by 0.6 times more than that in 2013, which would impose a huge pressure on mining industries’ sustainable development. Although the number of employees in mining industries have continued going up since 2013, the level of corporate profits will go down. At the same time, market changes of salt products will have higher and higher influences on the economic impact of salt industries. In addition, the value created by each employee in the industry will grow steadily, which shows that saline lake mineral resources will continue playing an important role in local economy. At the same time, the mining exploration process will witness a rapid increase in water use, emissions of waste water, gas and solid as well as environment pressure. Therefore, the exploitation of saline lake mineral resources needs to be managed in a systematic and scientific way, based on market mechanism and guided by good governance, in order to strike a balance between the economic growth and environmental protection. A pragmatic green circular economy of Qinghai province needs to be realized in the salt lake areas through encouraging technological innovation, boosting added value of salt-related products, spreading the knowledge of waste water recycling and accelerating the use of clean energy.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Valuation of mining investment opportunities typically focuses on revenues (i.e., amount of ore, mineral grade, and commodity prices), pre-production capital expenditures (CAPEX), and recurring operating expenditures (OPEX). Less emphasis is generally placed on longer-term costs that are harder to quantify, such as decommissioning, closure, and reclamation. Less emphasis still is placed on valuation of the very long term (or perpetual) costs of post-reclamation care (PRC) and long-term management (LTM) that should follow mine closure and reclamation, primarily due to technical and environmental uncertainties and the widespread practice of discounting, which renders the present value of distant future costs virtually nil particularly when typically high discount rates are used. Following on from the discussion of mine asset valuation in Part I (Espinoza and Rojo, 2017) of this two-part dissertation on sustainable mining, Part II discusses the inherent issues with the current practice of valuing project opportunities and accounting for PRC liabilities and LTM within the mining sector. The paper argues that mining sustainably starts with recognizing all potential future liabilities (routine and non-routine) through the life of a mine, ensuring that sufficient funds are available to address these liabilities, and investing these funds appropriately. Decoupled net present value (DNPV) analysis, which separates risk from the time value of money and treats risks as a cost to the project, is presented as a robust alternative to current accounting practices. This method can identify the effects of individual risk factors on the value of a project. A hypothetical example taken from the mining literature is used to compare the DNPV method with net present value (NPV) and modern asset pricing (MAP) analysis, and clearly illustrates the unsustainable consequences of using risk adjusted discount rates to value long term mining investments.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Under the effects of environmental pollution, macro-economical conditions, markets downturn, and squeeze of clean energy, the operation condition of China's whole coal industry attracts more attentions in recent years. This study aims to investigate the comprehensive competitiveness of coal industry in Chinese policy and economy environment. Then, this paper adopts diamond model to analyze internal and external factors that have significant influences on the competitiveness of China's coal industry, namely resource condition, demand condition, industry structure and enterprise strategy, related and support industries, the government, technology and chance. The research indicates that Chinese coal industry suffers from excessive capacity, low coal price and substitute of clean energy, etc. The current performance of Chinese coal industry is not optimistic. Fortunately, Chinese government unceasingly issues policies to support and regulate coal industry, and coal enterprises actively participate in industrial structure adjustments to deal with pressure of downturn.

"The corporate-community relations have always been an important influencing factor for the development of mining enterprises. In recent years, residents in the mining areas have been paying increased attention to their rights in the mining process, but the failure to properly handle corporate-community relations has resulted in conflict between mining enterprises and local communities. In severe situations, this may even trigger mass disturbances that cause disorders in their normal operations. Considering these potential circumstances, some Chinese mining enterprises started to emphasize corporate social responsibility (CSR), especially the construction of a sound corporate-community relationship, rather than simply making superficial efforts. As a model in such endeavors, the paper takes Kunyang Phosphate of Yunnan Phosphate Chemical Group as a case study; firstly, the development of relations between Kunyang Phosphate and the local community (Hanying Village) is divided into different periods, and each stage is analyzed from the aspect of corporate social responsibility performance of the mine.

"This study contributes to the debate on the competitiveness of countries to attract mining investments. The specific objectives of this work are: to bring empirical support to the alternative view of mining competitiveness, which highlights the key role of country's investment climate; and to propose a methodology, based on cross-country econometric models and the economic theory, to understand how the geological potential and the investment climate interact to define country's mining competitiveness.The research show that long-term mining competitiveness is not solely determined by the geological potential of countries. The models corroborate that both, geological potential and investment climate, are crucial to explain country's attractiveness. Moreover, the results suggest that the relationship of these two variables is not developed individually and additive, but through an interaction of both terms.Finally, the study identifies an “investment climate threshold area” in its final model. Mining competitiveness of countries with low investment climate depend on the interaction between their geological potential and investment climate. On the other hand, countries above this threshold compete for mining funds almost exclusively based on the mineral endowment of their territories. These findings could have relevant consequences in country's strategic decisions for the mining industry.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Nowadays, an increase in the overall tax burden on mining companies is being observed as a global trend. The governments of many countries view mining companies as quite profitable, therefore they would like to participate in the revenue arising from the exploitation of natural resources by, for example, taxing the activity. Currently the share of taxes and charges in the cost structure of the mining sector in Poland is at relatively high level, amounting to 7% of total production costs. The main factors affecting this situation are obligatory fees, such as (a) geological and mining taxes and fees, (b) taxes and fees for environmental use, (c) taxes and fees associated with employees and business, and (d) a new tax on the extraction of certain types of mineral which has been levied in Poland since 2012. The overall level of tax, including new taxes and royalties, has a positive impact on public and local finances, however higher taxation levels are likely to reduce mining companies’ incentives to invest. It has to be underlined that the anticipation of taxation during the various stages of a project is a crucial factor for investors. If an investor thinks that the tax system will be unfavourable to him during the production period, there is a risk that he will not make his investment (hold-up risk). However, if the tax system is changed after investments are made, the investor no longer has any choice (Laporte & Quatrebarbes 2015). And the latter was the case in Poland for KGHM Polska Miedź SA which has been mining in Poland for over 50 years and has sufficient resources for a further 30 years and more. Therefore tax has a significant impact, both on ongoing operations and on the development of new mineral resources in Poland. It has created additional challenges as the new tax on the extraction of certain types of mineral has a non-linear character, it is several times higher than other taxes, and is only levied on copper and silver. By diminishing the profits limit it can not only decrease exploration activity, but also cause some new investment in Poland to be cancelled. The aim of this paper is to analyse the effects of taxation on resource valuation in Polish copper existing mines, and to assess the implications both from an investor's and the Government's point of view from the medium to long-term perspective.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Mineral resources and the mining industry play an important role in economic development of many countries. The unique Russian mineral raw material base – phosphate and potash ore reserves in the case under consideration in this work – allows domestic mining and chemical companies not only to meet domestic demand but also to act as significant players on a global scale. Russian fertilizer companies enjoy a significant share of the global fertilizer market and have considerable strategic and social importance to the national economy. The objective of this paper is to identify and adopt the most appropriate methods and tools applicable to the peculiarities of fertilizer market and industry, as well as its highly dynamic environment. The paper briefly reviews research of strategic management in industry. We analyzed the current state of the mineral fertilizers market, identified main development trends and presented the unique characteristics of fertilizer (mining and chemical) companies in an oligopolistic market. The paper presents characteristics of industry environment using Ansoff's environmental turbulence matrix to evaluate appropriate management response and highlights the key features of fertilizer companies’ strategic management.

"Using plant level panel data of manufacturing firms in Iran from 2003 to 2013, we test the Dutch disease predictions, including the impact of a rise in oil prices on intensive and extensive margins of trade. Our findings indicate that during periods of high oil prices domestic currency appreciates, but contrary to resource curse theories, domestic firms export more, and new firms enter foreign markets. We reconcile this paradox by proposing a new channel, which we call “subsidy disease.” Despite rising oil prices, the government of Iran kept domestic energy prices at low levels, which increased the implicit subsidy accruing to energy intensive firms. In effect, these firms gain a competitive advantage in foreign markets because of the increased subsidy. We show that energy intensive plants export more when the oil price is high. Moreover, consistent with natural resource curse models, we show that the average wage increases during periods of high oil prices, but much less for exporting firms. We also find robust evidence that high oil prices reduce investments of manufacturing firms.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Supply of strategic materials during the Cold War was under the influence of military competition between East and West. But after the cold war and turning of geopolitics and geostrategy to geoeconomics, the assessment method of criticality matrix with dimension of economic importance and supply risk has been commenced by the US National Research Council. It has spread based on conflict between north and south and security or economic power of the developed countries. In this paper it is attempt to study a mineral using various critical minerals assessment methods to verify its effectiveness in economic development and its geoeconomics importance of Iran. One of such materials is the fluorite strategic mineral with trade mark of fluorspar that its deposits are found in the carbonate rocks of Triassic and Elika formation in Central Alborz and Shotori formation in central Iran. It was shown that the assessment methods used by the US Geological Survey, the US Department of Defense, EU and German Industries, depicted the fluorspar as a critical and strategic mineral in the world. Fluorspar economic value is because of its use in steel, aluminum, hydro-fluorocarbons, Teflon, renewable and clean energy production. The results of this study show the rank of Iran is seven in the world in terms of production, but this country is one of the main importers for intermediate goods made from these mineral among its neighboring countries. So as a first step, investment on systematic exploration of fluorspar resources is necessary to increase the supply of raw materials for the country's aluminum industry. Exploration of new reserves can also reduce concerns relevant to supply risk at the international level for developed countries. It can also be concluded that the joint investment, cooperation and concurrently researches in relation to raw materials and minerals, may lead to a reduction in competition between North and South countries. Hence, the review and monitoring of evaluation methods of critical raw materials in the developed countries is very important and valuable for choosing the appropriate policies for those developing countries that own these resources.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Hartwick's rule, which concerns reinvesting resource rents in manmade capital, together with the concept of dynamic efficiency, dealt with by Hotelling's Rule, imply that locally constant consumption is sustainable. Based on Hartwick's rule, we have a hypothesis: if the 29 provinces in China (except Beijing and Shanghai) had invested their resource rents (from three energy resources: oil, natural gas, and coal; and nine mineral resources: iron, copper, lead, zinc, nickel, tin, antimony, molybdenum, and aluminum) in produced capital stock from 1995 to 2014, then the value of these assets should have grown commensurately over time. Using hypothetical estimates of capital stocks, the capital produced from a postulated series of historical investments, and a perpetual inventory model (PIM), the capital produced from exhaustible resources value reinvestment under Hartwick's rule is estimated. The empirical results prove that China's 29 provinces fare very well under Hartwick's rule from 1995 to 2014, and the results show that the provinces exhibit regional differences that are non-synchronous with local economic growth. Some provinces are striking: Xinjiang, Heilong, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Tianjin would have higher energy resources rent shares and lower levels of capital accumulation.

"This paper analyzes the mineral resource definitions from the exploration boom that followed the rare earth element (REE) price peak of 2011, and finds that1.the delineated REE mineral resources outside of China reached a total of 98 Mt contained total rare earth oxides in 2015 with the majority located in Canada (38 Mt), Greenland (39 Mt) and Africa (10.3 Mt), representing a fivefold increase between 2010 (16.5 Mt combined) and 2015 (87.3 Mt combined).2.a large portion of these resources contain REE bearing silicates as dominant ore mineral which have a higher heavy REE to light REE ratio than conventional carbonate-mineral REE resources.The results highlight effective, stock market-financed exploration by junior companies and demonstrate REE resource availability outside of China. However, at current low prices, challenges to transform these resources from exploration to mining projects remain. These are tied to the up-scaling of beneficiation technologies for unconventional REE ore minerals and to raising investment for project implementation. In this context, we contend that the successful delineation of these REE resources provide abundant options for expansion and investment in the REE industry which are most likely harnessed by the dominant REE market player, China. Concerns about China’s dominant role are therefore likely to persist.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7

"Many researchers have confirmed that most accidents occur during night shifts, but coal mine production in China is an exception. The frequency of accidents during day shifts is significantly higher than that of night shifts. We refer to this as a safety paradox. This study collected 1870 instances of the worst fatal accidents in Chinese coal mines from 2002 to 2013, which in total accounted for the deaths of 13,477 miners. We mainly employed frequency analysis to describe the imbalance in accident risks between day shifts and night shifts. Then we deployed a reaction time test and “psychometric fatigue assessment scale” to measure the differences in mental fatigue between day-shift and night-shift workers. In further, we analyzed the supervision records of the coal mines and found that the level of supervision was more intensive during night shifts. Based on these analyses, we put forward ""the pendulum effect of mental fatigue"" as an explanation for the safety paradox experienced in Chinese coal mines. Lastly, we suggest possible solutions that coal mine managers and the government policy-makers could undertake.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"The rapid development of the international mineral trade has provided a solid material foundation for economic developments worldwide. Accompanying mineral international trade, there is a huge amount of carbon emission transferred from importing countries to exporting countries, which masks the true distribution of global carbon emission and blurs the lines about the responsibility for preserving the environment. Aiming to explore the embodied carbon emissions, we construct an embodied carbon emissions network of copper concentrates and refined copper international trade (ECCR) for each year during the sample period from 2007 to 2014. We analyze structure features of ECCR international trade. There exists a large amount of potential transfer of carbon emissions. The external dependency on copper concentrates of China is not so high. The trade volume shows that China, Germany and the United States are net importers, Chile, Peru and Zambia are net exporters. Moreover, the trade volumes of main countries change within a narrow range. Considering that the changes of ECCR international trade, energy policies or emergencies are main factors to resources-oriented countries, sudden global economic events are main factors to importers. Combined with the economy of every country, we also analyze the embodied carbon intensity, which are significantly different of distinct type’s countries. Furthermore, the evolution rule of embodied carbon intensity of some developed countries is similar to some developing countries.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Mineral and mining sectors are always of a great concern to any nation due to its major contribution to the economy. In India, the demand for coal is continuously on rise due to its ever increasing need from the growing power sectors and steel industries. In spite of the large coal reserves, India has to import coal from overseas sources to address the perpetual demand-supply gap. In order to reduce the dependence on imported coal, to ensure an affordable price to the domestic customers as well as to achieve operational efficiency, the state-owned coal mining organization of India have now started taking initiatives to outsource some of the operational activities involving private agencies. To realize the success of outsourcing, it is indispensable to consider it as part of the corporate decision. Such decision essentially considers all possible attributes of strategy planning for performance improvement. The study focuses on the development of an effective performance evaluation framework based on Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to analyze the suitability of organization's strategic decision of outsourcing in alignment with the organizational performance for the Indian coal mining organization. BSC administers strategic elements of decision making in assessing the performance of the firm whereas FAHP, on the other hand, is applied to determine the relative importance weight of criteria in regard to organizational objectives taking into consideration the vagueness and ambiguity of information as characteristics of decision-making problems. The findings of the present study establish the proposed framework as an analytical tool in strategy formulation and provide rationale guidance to management with regard to performance improvement.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"The current policies of both the EU and the Polish government, as far as developing a strategy of energy security is concerned, focus on searching for methods of diversification of independent energy sources. At the same time, the world faces a challenge of providing sustainable development. Eurostat data from 2013 clearly indicate that EU countries are dependent on energy and its resources are imported at a rate of up to 53,2%. However, Poland does not rate unsatisfactorily, and with a dependency level of 25,8%, is among the least dependent countries.This independence is guaranteed by black and brown coal deposits. In such a political environment, the Polish hard-coal mining industry needs to create a new policy of restructuring within the industry and to aid further development. The present article is an answer to the search for methods of forecasting mining production taking into account both the social and economic aspects of Polish mines. Therefore, this paper presents two elements of rationalisation in terms of the production efficiency of mining companies – human resources capital and the volume of black coal sales. The applied forecasting methods may help/determine the future number of employees working underground in Polish mining companies, on the basis of the proposed forecasting methods of the sale of black coal. On the basis of the presented research, the Authors wish to draw attention to the search for restructuring solutions in Polish coal mining companies, in areas other than human capital.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"The emerging economy of India counts gold and oil amongst its top imports, suggesting that the prices of these resources affect the domestic inflation and stock market. Expectations on future volatility in these prices might lead to changes in the expected (implied) volatility of the Indian stock market. Unlike prior studies, we use implied volatility indices to examine the cointegration and nonlinear causality amongst international gold, crude oil, and the Indian stock market. Results indicate the presence of cointegration relationships and a nonlinear and positive impact of the implied volatilities of gold and oil on the implied volatility of the Indian stock market. Interestingly, there is evidence of an inverse bi-directional causality between the implied volatilities of gold and oil prices.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"This article analyses proposals to reinforce positive effects and mitigate negative impacts derived from dimension stone mining. The strategies proposed for sustainable development take into consideration the importance and problems related to exploitation, as well as to long-term sustainability of a productive pole in a participatory process involving foresight. In addition, it also suggests a short-term strategy: a sustainability certification scheme for this activity. In spite of the intrinsic challenges, the proposals can potentially improve the dimension stone industry, turning this activity more sustainable through the adoption of social and environmental practices, not only through economy-related ones. In this sense, it is extremely important to encourage cooperation among the mining sectors, the society, and federal, state and municipal governments in the process to consolidate advantages and opportunities, not only for this industry, but also for the communities in the region where is installed the main production hub of dimension stone of the Espírito Santo State.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Much attention has been paid to community–investor relations in the petroleum sector in Africa, typically emphasising the responsibility of oil companies from the Global North to accommodate community interests. Empirical research that includes the role of the state actors in shaping these relations is limited. Based on empirical field research in mainland Tanzania, this article inscribes itself into an emerging body of literature that seeks to unpack land acquisition processes as a way to analyse relations among all the main actors. By focusing on struggles over the standards for the compulsory acquisition of land for petroleum investments, it points out that the political economy of land is decisive in determining the extent to which existing rights to land are accommodated. In this, the role of state authorities should not be underestimated. Their interactions with three ideal types of investors are analysed. The article demonstrates that investments originating in the Global South and in Tanzania have no less severe implications for land rights holders than those originating in Northern ones. This points to the need to expand the analytical focus in the petroleum literature from the behaviour of oil companies towards the broader political economy of land and petroleum investments. Whereas many investment processes may have been set in motion by Northern oil companies, they may not be the only actors, let alone the most important ones, influencing how land is acquired.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"The design and application of compensation package by the major large-scale mining company in Ghana's Prestea has not done enough to alleviate poverty of local farmers. This claim is made in the light of occasional food shortage and poor living conditions of local farmers. The mining company is to compensate and alleviate the poverty of local farmers for impacting on their farmlands has put a package together. Although expansive activities of the company have resulted in gold boom, unemployment and poverty have intensified in view of loss of farmlands to the large-scale mining company. Moreover, there are minimal prospects for local people to secure wage employment in the company's resuscitated gold-mining industry. It is therefore crucial to assess the capacity of the compensation package as part of the company's corporate social-responsibility (CSR) program to alleviate poverty of local farmers. This paper interrogates the strength of the package by rating its efficacy and impact on poverty alleviation. This paper demonstrates that the compensation is inadequate in alleviating poverty because the package is not commensurate with the value of the profitable farming industry.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Community relations are an integral part of successful and socially acceptable mining operations. Effective interactions between a mining company and a host community tend to foster mutual understanding and trust, leading to higher levels of acceptance of those operations. The Waihi gold mining operations in New Zealand, which consist of an open pit, several underground operations, a processing facility and waste storage facilities, are well known for their close proximity to their host community. In 2011, the company Newmont Waihi Gold announced a potentially controversial extension to their existing underground operations, which for the first time proposed to extend directly beneath homes in residential Waihi. At the time of this announcement, the company had made no consent application nor held permission to extend their operations. The announcement was the first stage in an extensive three year consultation period with the community to negotiate whether and how the extension might proceed. This paper provides a case study of community relations practice that draws on both quantitative and qualitative research methods to examine the drivers of community acceptance of this extension. This includes results of a survey of community members undertaken prior to the announcement of the proposed extension, which identifies why community members regarded the company as a positive member of their community, and how this contributed to their acceptance of the company. These findings are supported by a series of interviews with key stakeholders from both company and community that interrogate the community relations process and how the mine's extension was negotiated after the initial proposal was announced. Based on these findings, a number of initiatives that were jointly developed by the company, community and other stakeholders through a voluntary, facilitated negotiation process within the legal consenting regime are identified. It is also observed that these negotiations ultimately allowed this complex operation to proceed. Our findings highlight how community relations function in practice, how trust in the relationship between company and community is underpinned by procedural fairness in those interactions, and provide examples of how fair processes are negotiated in context.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"This paper examines the predictive power of oil price for gold price using the novel nonparametric causality-in-quantiles testing approach. The study uses weekly data over the April 1983-August 2016 period for both the spot and 1-month to 12-month futures markets. The new approach, the causality-in-quantile, allows one to test for causality-in-mean and causality-in-variance when there may be no causality in the first moment but higher order interdependencies may exist. The tests are preferred over the linear Granger causality test that might be subject to misleading results due to misspecification. Contrary to no predictability results obtained under misspecified linear structure, the nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test shows that oil price has a weak predictive power for the gold price. Moreover, the causality-in-variance tests obtain strong support for the predictive capacity of oil for gold market volatility. The results underline the importance of accounting for nonlinearity in the analysis of causality from oil to gold.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Mercury is a toxic pollutant that distributes globally once emitted into the air. Mercury emission is the primary environmental impact of small-scale and artisanal gold mining, which are responsible for nearly half of anthropogenic mercury emissions each year. Considering that small-scale, artisanal, and formal gold mining are linked by the global gold price, this analysis evaluates the question - In dollar terms, what is the difference in mercury emission impact, per ounce of gold production, from these three forms of mining? To answer this question, a calibrated benefit transfer approach is employed to apply environmental valuation literature estimates (of mercury's impact on global earnings) to twelve gold mining sites around the world. The results indicate a mean impact range of <$1–$5 for two formally operated open-pit mines in Nevada, $200–$600 for small-scale and artisanal sites that concentrate gold ore prior to mercury amalgamation, and $500–$3200 for small-scale and artisanal sites that amalgamate all of the ore. Given the vast disparity between impact per ounce estimates, even small leakages in gold production from formal to informal operations could increase the net environmental impact of global gold production. Future research ought to estimate this leakage rate by modeling small-scale and artisanal miners’ price elasticity of supply.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Since the beginning of the sixties, Sardinia (Italy) has established itself as a granite production area both nationally and internationally. The activity of quarrying and processing of marble began in the Orosei area (north-east Sardinia) by the end of the same decade. This study is aimed at describing the troubled time experienced by the Sardinian granite production at the beginning of the XXI century and the ongoing success achieved by Orosei marble. In fact, what was originally a less developed segment, the marble sector, became more established on the international market thanks to a number of optimal marketing strategies. The weaknesses and strengths of these two different sectors are described below. The paper gives an account of the current positioning strategies of stone industry in Sardinia with special attention to commercial development, the positioning of the product portfolio, quality and customer service. Although the Sardinian granite is a raw material with excellent features which are typical of commodities and is supported by the presence of skilled manpower, this industry has always had to deal with the high costs of the transport system and the lack of efficient infrastructure, until the Chinese competition gave it the final push. In contrast to the granite industry, the marble entrepreneurs of Orosei showed better marketing skills. The Sardinian marble industry has the strategic advantage of having all companies concentrated in a limited and homogeneous area of quarrying and processing activities. Furthermore, producers together with the Municipality of Orosei founded a Consortium whose aim is currently to manage waste disposal at the landfill with the idea of transforming the landfill itself into a Centre for stone materials aimed at secondary processing, where training sessions on different subjects pertaining to the Dimension Stone sector will be held and a historical route aimed at industrial tourism will be organized.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Inventories have traditionally been regarded as key measures to respond to market risks. Although benchmark exchanges are increasingly important, their inventories actually utilized are those in the local markets. The perspective that we benefit from the inventories that are available and in proximity is conceptualized as the accessibility of inventories. To explore the accessibility issue, this study analyzes the convenience yields of the Chinese domestic copper market for the period of January 2011 through April 2015. The results indicate that local markets benefit from and are influenced by accessible inventories, but not from less accessible inventories. Furthermore, imports act as inventory inflows, which can be considered the movement of the accessible inventories that provide convenience yields to local markets. In addition, we show that volatility is the central difference between the cost-of-carry and option pricing models, which are representative estimation methods for convenience yields.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Australia's national economy continues to benefit from the extraction and exportation of non-renewable resources, even despite the end of its mining boom. The negative impacts of this primary industry endure and are felt disproportionately by rural communities in close proximity to mining sites. The challenge of holding mining and extractive companies to account for social concerns – which may be difficult to measure or pin down to any one cause – has influenced affected communities to look to other, non-regulatory means of accountability to raise their concerns and see them addressed. ‘Social licence to operate’ (SLO) is often touted as one such tool for holding large resource companies to account. But a growing field of research into the concept has remained largely focused on social capital measures and has yet to consider the conditions necessary to facilitate communities’ successful deployment of SLO as an accountability mechanism or negotiation tool. There remains a gap in our understanding about how SLO can be used meaningfully by communities as a tool for advocacy and accountability, especially in company-community negotiations.This article introduces a strategic action fields (SAFs) approach to SLO to facilitate exploration of the relative strength between and within differing views (power), requirements and agendas of stakeholder groups (strategic agendas) and the aligned interconnections of affected stakeholders (social cohesion), thus enhancing understandings of SLO possible through a social capital approach.In introducing SAFs for SLO, this article extends research on SLO measurement through exploration of three central research questions. First, it asks whether and how SLO might exist as more than a benchmark measurement of acceptability, as defined primarily from corporate, risk-based perspectives? Secondly, building on existing, social capital-based approaches to SLO measurement, are there other approaches that could complement or extend a social capital approach to SLO to understand better a community's ability to operationalise it? Following this, how might insights possible via a complementary means of SLO measurement assist us to expand current understandings about the role of relationships in granting SLO?Three M&E sector case studies from the resource intensive states of Western Australia and Queensland are explored via a set of 105 government, public, media, social media and other related documents. Data was thematically analysed using N*Vivo10 software. Application of social capital and SAFs approaches reveals key tensions in claims to a SLO, especially where, under a social capital-only approach, strong relationships between particular stakeholders would suggest that a SLO has been granted. The addition of a SAFs lens—especially consideration of social cohesion—reveals that even where SLO may be granted, it may not necessarily be operationalizable by communities due to these competing fields. The article concludes with suggestions about the benefits of applying SAFs to SLO measurement, as a means of teasing out the utility of the concept to affected stakeholders. Recommendations for future research adopting this approach are also suggested.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"One of the goals presented here is the use of a radial basis function (RBF) method to approximate the numerical values of a gold mining project. RBFs have many attractive features compared to implicit finite differences method (FDM) and explicit FDM. They are mesh-free, computationally more efficient in high dimensions, and very accurate. In other words, the model is more comprehensive, and results are more accurate compared to the previous works. This paper compares accuracy of the RBF method with that of the implicit method (FDM) in this case study. The results indicate that convergence order of the RBF is higher than that of the implicit method. Also, this paper compares the results of the RBF method with those of implicit method for various scenarios.The most important goal presented here is combining exchange rate uncertainty together with commodity price (spot price) uncertainty. In fact, this paper tries to address this question: how can we model the exchange rate volatility and the correlation coefficient between returns of commodity price and exchange rate in assessing a gold mining project. Considering the disadvantages of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method which does not use uncertainties, the approach presented here makes use of real options valuation for a gold mine project valuation. This paper uses an explicit method (FDM) for these calculations. The results indicate increasing volatilities for either or both commodity price or exchange rate results in decreasing the maximum project value. Also, the correlation coefficients between returns of commodity price and exchange rate in different years are negative and statistically significant. The final result indicates that with an increase in the correlation coefficient, the volatility of gold price in terms of Canadian dollar decreases and therefore the maximum project value increases too. In summary, the exchange rate volatility and the correlation coefficient between returns of commodity price and exchange rate have a significant impact on mining project values.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"This paper examines the dependence of gold and benchmark bonds with ten stock markets, including five larger developed markets (e.g., the USA, the UK, Japan, Canada and Germany) and five Eurozone peripheral GIPSI countries’ (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Ireland) stock markets. We use a novel quantile-on-quantile (QQ) approach to construct the dependence estimates of the quantiles of gold and bonds with the quantiles of stock markets. The QQ approach, recently developed by Sim and Zhou (2015), captures the dependence between the entire distributions of financial assets and uncovers some nuance features of the relationship. The empirical findings primarily show that gold is a strong hedge and diversifier for the stock portfolio except when both markets are under stress. Furthermore, the flight to safety phenomenon is short-lived because national benchmark bonds exhibit a positive dependence with their respective countries’ stock indices at various quantiles. In contrast to the existing literature, the QQ approach suggests that bonds act as safe havens for the stock portfolio, but gold does not. Our findings also suggest that the dependence between stock-gold and stock-bond pairs is not uniform, and this relationship is market state (e.g., bearish, mild bearish, optimistic or bullish) and country specific.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"In various industries, multinational companies are the dominant players while local firms play a less prominent role. We consider such an industry and develop a model in which foreign multinationals strategically interact in technology transfer and compete in the product market stage. Furthermore, we analyze the welfare implications of often observed FDI policy measures. We find that the cost of technology transfer provides a possible rationale for why in practice FDI crowding out effects are often smaller in less developed countries.We also find that foreign ownership restrictions may reduce FDI crowding-out effects. However, the net effect of these restrictions on host country welfare will be negative. Finally, we find that, in industries with low levels of product market competition (e.g. the natural resources sector), the government may improve welfare by taking away the joint venture equity share of the domestic firm.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"There are considerable concerns about the supply security of certain high-tech elements produced as by-products. To determine in how far these concerns are justified by the actual availability of these elements, we compare the supply potentials for three particularly relevant examples – gallium, germanium and indium – to current and historic production volumes. Our assessment is based on detailed estimates of the amounts extractable from various raw materials given contemporary market prices and technologies. While the estimate for gallium is taken from a previous publication, the estimate for germanium is recalculated from an earlier estimate of recoverable germanium in reserves and resources, and the estimate for indium is compiled as part of this article.We find that the supply potentials of all three elements significantly exceed current primary production. However, the degree to which this is the case varies from element to element. While both the supply potentials of gallium and germanium are ~10 times higher than primary production, the supply potential of indium is ~3 times higher.Differences also exist in historic growth trends, with indium showing the fastest growth rate of the utilised supply potential. This makes it the most likely of the three to reach its maximum production level in the future. Based on these considerations we propose a new quantitative indicator for the future availability of by-products, time-to-maximum extraction as a by-product (TMEB), and show its utility in discriminating between the different supply situations of the three by-product elements.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Based on its economic development and population expansion, China has become one of the most important countries in terms of accounting for materials used worldwide. A deeper understanding of how material use has evolved in China is needed to devise appropriate policies in the future. This paper applied a logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) to decompose the driving forces of changes in China's material use during the 2002–2012 period into five component effects: population, activity, structural, intensity and material structural effects. In addition, a decoupling index was used to further analyse the decoupling relationship between China's material use and gross output per capita. The results show that Chinese material use has risen from 11.8 billion tonnes in 2002 to 35 billion tonnes in 2012 and that the economic activity effect is the largest positive contributor to the growth in material use, followed by material structural effect, population effect and structural effects. The material intensity effect positively promoted the increase in material use during the 2002–2007 period, although it played a negative role during the 2007–2012 period. A province-level analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity. Some provinces exhibit falling material use, although in most provinces, material use significantly increases. The decoupling analysis indicates that relative decoupling and no decoupling effects characterize the main conditions across the provinces during the study period. Policy recommendations are then made based on our findings.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Considering the growing rate of global wind power and overall benefits of the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbines, the future demand for high-performing NdFeB magnet and its constituent elements is likely to increase. Future deployment of wind power generation may be affected by potential disruptions in supply and price rises of critical rare earth elements. By evaluating the substitution options for the rare earths permanent magnet-based wind turbines at the material and component levels, this paper shows that substitution has a real potential to alleviate the pressure on the supply of rare earths in the wind industry. Rare earth-free turbines with good efficiency levels were already developed and could be further adopted. Alternatively, the future demand for rare earths, in particular for dysprosium, could be reduced by improving material efficiency. The future market share of rare earth-based wind turbines will most likely depend on the evolution of the price of rare earths and the techno-economic advantages of PMSG in comparison to alternative technologies that use no rare earths elements.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"The study investigates the dynamic relationship of global crude oil and gold price in a two-regime vector error-correction model with a single cointegrating vector and a threshold effect on error-correction terms as proposed by Hansen and Seo (2002). The study is conducted with weekly spot prices of Brent crude oil and gold for the period January 2, 2009 to November 20, 2015. The empirical results suggest the effectiveness of threshold cointegration model over a linear cointegration model signifying non-linearity in long-term relationship between gold and oil price. It also establishes different long-run and short-run dynamics of gold and oil in two regimes, termed as ‘typical’ and ‘extreme’ regimes based on the threshold parameter. The study reveals a lead lag relationship between gold and oil price suggesting ‘gold’ as investors’ safe haven against inflation. This phenomenon, however, exists only in a typical regime. In contrast, in an extreme regime, with gold price dominating the market, investors’ are found to switch between gold and oil in order to diversify the portfolio risk. This indicates that the relationship between gold and oil price is non-linear and asymmetric. The study surpasses previous studies by establishing the fact that the relationship between gold and oil is regime dependent, and hence does not remain constant during the entire period of the study. The findings have important implications for policy makers and investors. The study also demonstrates robustness in empirical findings by maintaining profound statistical congruency.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"A key aspiration for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the resource sector is to leave behind a lasting and positive legacy for local and regional communities, which is referred to here as Enduring Community Value (ECV). This paper examines the capacity of resource companies to create ECV for local communities within three jurisdictions in Australia drawing on perspectives from resource company employees and key stakeholders including individuals and groups in local communities.The capacity to implement ECV was tracked through the planning, governance, implementation and evaluation phases of CSR for companies of different sizes, stage of mining life-cycle and degree of remoteness of mining operations.ECV was found to be a critical value of CSR for resource company employees and stakeholders, providing a common ground for engagement and cooperation. Company employees, also saw ECV as a necessary tool to help navigate the complexities of CSR within a local community context.Personal moral and ethical values of resource employees and stakeholders, including motivations to improve local community outcomes and to achieve sustainability drove the adoption of ECV. This was supported to varying degrees by resource companies’ culture and goals, organisational values of stakeholder organisations, regulatory and legislative frameworks, guidelines and standards.Through the application of Giddens’ structuration theory it was identified that there was a high reliance on human agency to drive outcomes, with a lack of consistent institutional structures and relevant processes being in place. This meant that planning for ECV often occurred late in the mine life-cycle, reducing the potential benefits. Further institutional support, such as through robust planning tools, guidelines and standards and resourced stakeholder forums where lessons, experiences and assessments are shared, could help drive outcomes more clearly toward ECV. The implications of models for CSR and sustainable development perspectives are also presented.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7

Viewing IBAs through a private governance lens generates important insights for both governance scholars and for scholars interested the structuring of Indigenous-corporate relations in the context of resource development. In order to develop this argument, we present a case study of a specific arrangement between a Canadian First Nation and a multi-national mining company with a particular focus on the governance elements of the contract and the implications for legitimacy that arise from the arrangement. Our central claim is that IBAs, as a form of private governance, require a theory of legitimacy that goes beyond contractual consent, but must account for both procedural and substantive legitimacy demands. We then identify the key lessons that can be taken for indigenous law and governance scholars and private governance scholars from our analysis.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7

It is a well-known fact that due to their option-like characteristics, the value of these managerial flexibilities is not captured by traditional valuation techniques, such as the discounted cash flow method.In this article we develop a dynamic model for the assessment of the financial viability of flexible mining projects in the exploration stage (junior mines). We assume the firm has the option to defer the initial investment for a period of time, and once invested, has the additional flexibility to expand or even abandon the project. The model simulates the managerial decision making process and determines the value of the flexibility, or real options, associated with the mining project. On the other hand, for the case of firms that are listed in the stock market, the model assesses the likely impact of these options on the firm´s market value. We present a case study where we apply this model to a silver junior mining venture in Perú. The results indicate that the combined real options associated with the project may have a significant impact on its value, suggesting that the firm´s stock is undervalued by approximately 25%.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"The mining sector faces some of the most difficult sustainability challenges of any industrial sector. The mining sector is remarkably significant to the development of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) region, because the majority of global trade and investment in this region depends on this sector. Therefore, the assessment of mining sector sustainability at national and global scales in APEC economies is an important task. So far, however, mining sector sustainability assessment frameworks have only been developed at small scales, such as companies and cities. In this study, therefore, it is proposed an indicator-based sustainability assessment framework (iSAF) to assess mining sector sustainability at national and global scales. In this framework, fuzzy logic was utilized to adequately deal with the uncertainty and vagueness of human expressions. The conventional fuzzy scales were suitably modified in the proposed framework to facilitate confident decision-making by the relevant stakeholders. In order to avoid repeatedly conducting the judgment until the acceptable consistency was obtained, iSAF implemented an innovative theory to deal with unacceptable consistencies in judgment. The proposed iSAF was applied to the mining sector of APEC economies using data from the APEC 2010 Project. As for the results, three important criteria including economic, environmental, and social criteria and twenty significant indicators were appropriately selected to cover the actual situation in the sector. The results showed that iSAF was a suitable framework for preventing uncertainty and vagueness in decision-making. iSAF was found to provide crucial support to decision-makers, not only in identifying and structuring the main components contributing to sustainability, but also in pointing out the factors in which significant investment should be made to effectively improve sustainability.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"The West African country of Burkina Faso has become a leading African producer of gold in recent years. While this is mainly due to a boom in industrial gold mining since 2008, artisanal gold mining has been practiced throughout the country since the 1980s and continues to be an important source of livelihood for an estimated 1,2 Mio people (of a total population of c. 17 Mio). Private gold buying companies who were well-connected with the Compaoré government (1987–2014) profited from the privatization of the artisanal gold mining sector since the mid-1990s. This led to a situation where some Burkinabè businessmen made their own laws in gold mining areas, smuggled most of the gold out of the country and provoked violent conflicts with gold miners and local populations. This paper gives an overview of the institutional changes that have shaped artisanal gold mining in Burkina Faso from the mid-1980s until today.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"Forecasting the prices of metals is important in many aspects of economics. Metal prices are also vital variables in financial models for revenue evaluation, which forms the basis of an effective payment regime using by resource policymakers. In this article, we utilized a machine-learning algorithm based on decision tree to predict future copper prices. We showed that our method is capable of accurately and reliably predicting copper prices in both short-term (days) and long-term (years), with mean absolute percentage errors below 4%. We also demonstrated that the current method is assumption-free, robust, and not prone to human bias. This method is easily and readily applicable to predicting the prices of other metals and other commodities, and we expect that such method could be useful in a broad range of fields.",Volume 52,June 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/52/suppl/C,7
"This paper examines mechanisms that stakeholder groups use in order to influence corporate social responsibility (CSR) and their involvement in the Chilean mining sector. The article adopts a qualitative approach and reports on semi-structured interviews conducted with five stakeholder groups. The findings show that the influence wielded by stakeholders to drive mining companies to act more responsibly is founded in five principal mechanisms: demands, communication, counselling, control and engagement. The manner in which stakeholders use these mechanisms varies across stakeholder groups. Some stakeholders adopt a single mechanism, as is the case for communities and media. Other stakeholders such as NGOs, adopt multiple mechanisms. From a dichotomised perspective in relation to involvement, the paper also identifies that stakeholders utilise these mechanisms considering an active (for groups such as government and media) and passive involvement (in the case of communities and unions). NGOs are the only stakeholder group that appear to adopt both active and passive participation, depending on the mechanisms under consideration.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"Using the example of iron and steel industry, this paper aims to reveal the market demand effect and the mechanism on investment and capacity allocation. Based on building the theoretical model containing demand dynamic gap with the quarterly data of iron and steel industry since 2004, time-varying parameter model is used to empirically test the asymmetric adjustment mechanism of the productivity allocation under demand inducing and the effect of policies. The results show that obvious asymmetric features in the formulating and withdrawing phases of iron and steel productivity caused by inducing demand dynamics and its asymmetric periodic motion; self-correction mechanism of productivity under the situation of frequent switching between supply and demand is limited. Once the deviation from the equilibrium level of production capacity exceeds its own threshold adjustment mechanism, it is unable to restore equilibrium through market regulation, and leads to the extraordinary ""trial and error"" cost; further takes the correlation mechanism among industries as the breakthrough point to do more empirical tests of the effects of downstream industry dynamic demand on the steel industry capacity. It also indicates that the development of the real estate industry when Chinese economic environment is good directly introduces the steel industry capacity allocation, Grasping accurately the above rules is the premise of achieving market’s decisive role in the resource allocating process while giving full play to government function.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"This article explores the question of why countries in Africa increasingly took the decision to review and renegotiate their contracts with international mining companies during the period from 2000 to 2013. A policy window opened for African governments to renegotiate their mining contracts, brought on by the coming together of a problem, a set of policies, and developments in the political stream at the international, regional, and domestic levels. I suggest several explanations to account for these favourable dynamics at all three levels. The fact that African countries were briefly situated within a certain international and regional environment, combined with specific characteristics at the domestic level – including emergence from conflict and/or regime change, and a strong civil society presence calling for companies to sign agreements more in line with country interests – is an important determinant of renegotiation decisions. Cross-country comparisons and detailed case studies from Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo provide greater insight into these processes. This iterative, heuristic case-study approach yields greater insight into why some African countries decided to renegotiate their mining contracts. Yet the empirical evidence highlights the limitations to African countries' newfound “window of opportunity.” The recent drop in commodity prices, moreover, suggests that this window has closed and may not reopen for some time.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"Based on the 2012 data from 116 resource-based cities in China, this paper measures efficiency in resource-based cities by using the super-SBM model, analyzes the differences in efficiency levels among cities, and finds their major determinants. It also examines if the effects of the determinants on efficiency vary at different efficiency-levels by using quantile regression. The four major findings of this study are as follows. First, most of the resource-based cities in China are total factor energy (TFE) inefficient. Second, the level of industrialization, the contribution of service industry to local GDP, and the size of built districts in the city are the three major determinants with significantly positive effect on efficiency. On the other hand, consumer spending, the local government expenditure, and the availability of vocational schools are the three major determinants with significantly negative effect on efficiency. Third, the six determining factors account for 79% of the efficiency differences among the cities. However, the contributions of the factors to TFE efficiency vary widely. Fourth, the effects of the determinants on TFE efficiency change with the efficiency-level of the city.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"With regard to the immense importance of cut-off grade in designing and planning open pit mines, optimizing this parameter has considerable effects in mining economic. This paper describes objective function for single metal mines with multi-product. For this purpose, the operation process in mine No.1 of the Golgohar iron mine that produces three types of products (sizing, concentrate and pellet) for sales is used to model objective function. Then the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) has been utilized to find out the optimum cut-off grades. Consequently, the optimum cut-off grades has been calculated between 40.5 and 47.5% and net present value has been obtained 18,142 billion Rial. In addition, production scheduling is carried out for five years mining plan pushback. Therefore, the average stripping ratio has been determined 1.41. The result shows that by stockpiling low-grade ore, concentrate plant can be fed by maximum capacity for one year addition to the primary plan.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"In sparsely populated areas of the interior of the Guianas, artisanal and small-scale gold mining has become the primary economic activity for local and migrant populations over the last three decades. Because of the adverse environmental and social impacts often associated with artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), these activities can be a source of unease for governments, and the question of how to confront the growing challenges of ASM has become a global concern. Formalization of the sector is increasingly being put forward as one strategy to mitigate the impacts associated with ASM, and there is a growing consensus that large-scale mining (LSM) companies have a role to play in this process. This article examines the perspectives of artisanal and small-scale miners on an initiative to formalize the ASM sector in a rural region in the interior of the Guianas. Through an analysis of a collaboration between a national government and a LSM company to create a reserve for artisanal and small-scale gold miners, we identify the major opportunities and limitations of this strategy. These opportunities and limitations demonstrate that although an artisanal and small-scale mining reserve could be one way to formalize the sector and support rural livelihoods, there are clear barriers to overcome to improve the interactions among governments, companies, artisanal and small-scale miners, and local communities.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"Mines provide essential materials for life and human progress; however, on the other hand, the possibility of life and having healthy environment is adversely affected by increasing pollution. Mine waste (tailing) is one of the pollutants generated by mines that should be properly managed. Nowadays, strategic management by using appropriate tools and technology is essential for the proper management of waste everywhere, including the urban, rural, medical, industrial, and mining environments. This study aims to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT), and strategies for waste management in iron mines and provide a quantitative basis to analytically determine the ranking of the factors in SWOT analysis via conventional multi-criteria decision-making methods: Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).The AHP method was used to calculate the weights of evaluation criteria and the TOPSIS method was preferred because of its capability to use both negative and positive criteria among the SWOT factors. The results of the evaluation matrix of internal and external factors showed that overall, the strengths overcame the weaknesses. However, if the opportunities are used well and correctly, threats can be overcome and weaknesses can be eliminated. Therefore, strategies based on weaknesses–opportunities (WO) are first priority. Sixteen strategies that are presented based on the SWOTs and prioritized based on TOPSIS could be useful for Sirjan's Golgohar iron ore to develop and promote its future mine waste management at the strategic level.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"This paper explores the effect of investor sentiment on the intraday return dynamics in the gold market. We build on the recent evidence by Da et al. (2015) that the Financial and Economic Attitudes Revealed by Search (FEARS) index, as a proxy for investor sentiment, has predictive power over stock market returns and extend the analysis to gold intraday returns using a novel methodology developed by Balcilar et al. (2016) to examine nonlinear casual effects of sentiment on gold return and volatility. We find that the effect of investor sentiment is more prevalent on intraday volatility in the gold market, rather than daily returns. The sentiment effect, however, is channeled via the discontinuous (jump) component of intraday volatility, particularly at extreme quantiles, implying that extreme fear (confidence) contributes to positive (negative) volatility jumps in gold returns. The results suggest that measures of sentiment could be utilized to model volatility jumps in safe haven assets that are often hard to predict and have significant implications for risk management as well as the pricing of options.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"In recent years, land use conflicts between large-scale mining sector and local communities have increased in the global south. However, with proper planning, it is possible that both companies and local communities can co-exist in the landscape. Thus, this paper explores land use conflicts in an emerging mining region as a function of: (i) anticipated displacement and (ii) improper understanding of affected communities. Fieldwork and in-depth study was conducted at Ghana's emerging North-west gold province. Participatory mapping, and focus group discussions were used in this study. The study found1 latent contestations against mineral exploration in the area. It further established baseline indicators of land use conflict risks in the area. The study also found that despite the looming large-scale mining sector activities in the area, there are no existing strategies for managing land use conflicts. Hence, the paper advances that robustly calculating and addressing a priori local concerns can enhance peaceful co-existence between the mining sector and local communities.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"The article presents the use of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method for the support of decisions regarding the choice of mining investment. The mining investment, as understood in the analysis conducted in the article is an acquisition of a plant mining zinc and lead ore together with the processing plant producing concentrates of these metals as well as the deposits potentially viable for mining. The subject of analysis consisted of 11 polymetallic ore deposits with different degrees of utilization and mining infrastructure which could be a subject of investment activities in Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia.In order to choose the best investment solution, a hierarchic model was built which took into account 5 main criteria and 15 partial criteria. These included in particular quantitative criteria, due to which the degree of subjectivism has been reduced. The main criteria included: geological and mining conditions, technical condition of the mining infrastructure, influence of the conducted mining activity on the environment, capital expenditure for particular stages of the investment and finally – social and political background which described the investment risk.The assessment of influence of the mining plant on the environment was conducted using the influence matrix, so called Leopold's matrix. The method allowed for identifying influences which affected the environment's components and simultaneously permitted to quantify the degree of this influence.For each criterion, accordingly to the AHP method's principles, weights (priorities) have been calculated. The weights were then used for construction of aggregating indicators. The choice of the best investment solution was obtained thanks to the use of an aggregating indicator which is a measure of assessment of particular polymetallic ore deposits. The indicators were the base for creating a rating for the mining objects from the point of view of assessment for the investor's needs.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"Lithium has an increasingly strategic role as clean technologies emerge. This strategic role is especially evident for electric vehicle technology with a critical dependence on lithium-ion battery technology. China is the world's largest lithium consumer due to its rapid economic development, large population, and soaring consumer demand for electric vehicles driven by stricter air quality control regulations. Given this background, this study introduces the first lithium material flow analysis (MFA) for China. This MFA will inform national lithium management plans. The MFA results indicate that China's consumption was 86.7 kt of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2015, accounting for 50% of the global total. China's lithium resource is highly dependent on imports, 70% of spodumene concentrate is imported from Australia alone. Along the material life cycle (value) chain, lithium outflows were primarily from exports of lithium chemicals and lithium-embodied products. Remaining lithium in-use stocks are embodied in electric vehicles, consumer electronics, lubricating greases, and glasses/ceramics. Electric vehicle sales growth projections will likely increase China's dependence on lithium imports, lead to potential lithium supply security concerns for China. Large amount of lithium stock embodied in electric vehicles and other lithium-ion battery-containing products implies more opportunities for lithium recycling in a circular economy context.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"Against the backdrop of potential reliable and sustainable future production of platinum for export in South Africa, this article sheds some light on the dynamics of commodity pricing, specifically with respect to the recent low platinum price. In this regard, a structural vector autoregression (VAR) was applied to observe the sensitivity of the platinum price and future pricing due to changes in macroeconomic variables, but also to review changes in macroeconomic variables due to changes in the platinum (commodity) price. The variables used for decomposition were the platinum price, the oil price, the real effective exchange rate of the United States (US), the US Federal funds rate, and total combined gross domestic product (GDP) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Impulse response functions, with shocks to each system were investigated, and the forecast error variance decomposition was examined. The main results were that a shock to OECD GDP results in a platinum price increase, that is, a positive correlation between output and the platinum price. A shock to the oil price causes the platinum price to spike in the short term, then decrease over the medium term, then move sideways in the long term. A shock to the US Federal funds rate makes the platinum price spike in the short term, then decrease over the medium term and move sideways over the long term. Finally, a shock to the real effective exchange rate of the United States causes the platinum price move sideways. The dynamics of commodity pricing is important to ensure platinum sustainability in the future, fostering capital investment within a corrective policy environment. The present research could serve as a guide for possible early and therefore less dramatic interventions. At best, in normal circumstances, with a fully functioning labour force, the research could help achieve expected planned reliable production going forward, and at worst, it provides the necessary stimulus for future research and a review of predictions made.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"Artisanal and small scale mining (ASM) sites in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) present livelihoods opportunities within an evolving security situation, thus offering the potential for economic and physical security. This paper presents survey data detailing reasons why men and women in eastern DRC migrate to ASM sites, with a specific focus on the extent to which insecurity wrought by the DRC's decades long conflict influences individuals’ migration decisions. It draws from research performed under a World Bank-Harvard Humanitarian Initiative research project. Following the literature review on decision-making related to ASM and migration and its applicability to the research context of eastern DRC, the article first presents basic demographics of the 998 men and women surveyed. It then details participants’ specific motivations for migration and groups them as push or pull factors. Finally, the article looks at the relationship between migration and the relevant migration and security variables separately before creating a multiple regression model to see how these variables inform migration decisions collectively. Participants largely migrated to ASM sites for the purpose of seeking money and/or employment. Security – specifically the presence of an armed group at one's reception site – also informed migration decision making, yet it did not negate the role of economic factors. This is the first paper the authors know of that examines gender-specific motivations for migration to ASM sites as well as how insecurity influences decisions to migrate to ASM sites.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8

We review the mechanisms through which resource wealth might slow economic growth, and the empirical studies that test for an effect overall, or on factors associated with growth. We include more recent studies suggesting the resource curse reflects only empirical misspecification. After reflecting on this conflicting evidence, and the findings of other recent surveys, we argue the evidence that resource dependence negatively affects growth remains convincing, particularly working through factors closely associated with growth in developing countries. Recent contrarian studies demonstrate that future research should better address endogeneity of dependence measures, and expand the years of study and range of empirical methodologies used.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"This article extends Chinn and Coibion (2014)'s work--Journal of Futures Markets 34-- on predictive content of commodity futures by considering a more comprehensive database and a longer time span, ranging from 25 to 65 years, and by presenting two extensions: multi-equation estimation of risk premiums and testing for the theory of storage.The empirical results show that futures-based forecasts for animal and agricultural products and industrial metals tend to be more efficient, in terms of mean absolute error, than random walk based-forecasts at a one-year horizon. On the other hand, based on robust rolling estimates, there is evidence of constant and time-varying risk premiums in agricultural and precious metals, but their statistical significance vary considerably along the sample period. In particular, gold and silver show evidence of a negative time-varying risk premium, as opposed to platinum.Multi-equation estimation brings efficiency gains in premium gauging, which leads to reject that the futures price is an unbiased estimate of the spot price for all commodity classes. On the other hand, the sampled commodities lend only partial support to the theory of storage, and for the specific case of industrial metals, inventories seem to matter more than interest rates to explain the basis. Altogether, this article finds mixed support for the premium-based model and for the theory of storage.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"Launched in 2003, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) has become a global standard for transparency in extractive sectors. Yet, there remains much debate over the success of the EITI. In this article, we establish a conceptual categorization of goals for organizations like the EITI, systematically identify the various goals associated with the EITI, and then examine empirical evidence to evaluate its specific achievements. We find that the EITI has been most successful in reaching its institutional goals, notably by becoming a recognized brand and consolidating transparency as a global norm. The EITI has been fairly successful in reaching some of the operational goals, such as setting up standards for auditing, reporting, and civil society involvement in multi-stakeholder groups. Whether the EITI has had an impact on developmental goals remains an open question as it is challenging to identify the correct measurements for impact and many evaluations assess goals that are over-inflated compared to what the initiative formally seeks to achieve. We conclude that any evaluation of the EITI needs to be clear about which type of objective it is measuring, and that an evaluation should not deem the EITI in general as a success or failure based on evaluating only one or two aspects of the initiative.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"Consultation is the predominant method of community engagement in infrastructure development. Therefore, understanding stakeholder interactions within consultation is critical to acquiring a social licence to operate. While previous research has focused on the factors which contribute to this social licence, little work has been conducted on how mining company consultation strategies influence perception formation. We explore how stakeholder expectations and experience of consultation impact perceptions of proposed mining projects. We undertook a case study of a proposed, large-scale, mineral sands mine in rural Australia using an open and closed-question questionnaire (n =32) and semi-structured interviews (n =20). We find that there are multiple, diverging understandings of the purpose of consultation both within and between stakeholder groups. The community experience of consultation drove negative perceptions of the proposed mine due to procedural and personal factors. We find several overlaps with the renewable energy (RE) literature, including: calls for two-way communication, (mis)trust of professional stakeholders, and the need for consistent and well-timed consultation. Other factors are not as common in the RE literature, and may be more specific to mining, such as stakeholder disenfranchisement misunderstood as apathy, calls for community involvement in agenda setting, the need for careful selection of company representatives, and the importance of meeting stakeholder expectations of consultation.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"Since 2012 the coal industry in China has deeply fallen into depression. When entering into 2015, the tragedy continued. What the future of China's coal is has confused the scholars and managers. In order to evaluate the current competitiveness of coal industry in China, the diamond model is employed in present study to analyze the influence of six components on the competitiveness, namely factor condition, demand condition, related and support department, firm strategy, structure and rivalry, government, chance. The result of diamond model shows that the coal industry suffers from excessive capacity, low industry concentration ratio, low price and low investment, etc. The current competitiveness of coal industry in China is not satisfactory. Fortunately, China government has issued lists of policies to recover the industry. Besides, some strategic plans provide great chances for the recovery of coal industry. At the end of this paper, a gear model is applied to design a dynamic competitiveness improvement mechanism of coal industry in China. The model shows that the power comes from the coal industry itself is the main active force to impel the improvement of coal industry competitiveness, and the government, chance, related and support department play accessory but indispensable roles.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"In India gold imports act as a huge burden on the country's current account balance and a large part of it lies idle in the economy. The attempts to curb the import demand have often failed in recent past. We explore the reasons of such failures by analyzing the gold demand pattern of India. In India gold is viewed not only as a consumption good and a financial asset; it also has a socio cultural dimension since ages. This paper derives the price and income elasticities of physical import demand for gold by taking these factors in account, which is unique in its scope. Unlike previous studies gold imports used for different purposes (jewellery, bar etc.) are analysed separately. The possibility of habit formation and inventory adjustment in determining the dynamics of India's import demand for gold have also been taken into consideration. Our findings suggest: first, different motives play roles in shaping demand for different forms of gold, although investment behaviour dominates over habit persistence in aggregate; second, given that the import demand for gold bars is inelastic with respect to real price, ceteris paribus, in both the short-run and the long-run, increment of tariff rates would not reduce import of other non-monetary unwrought forms of gold substantially; third, change in tariff rates, however, can bring down gold jewellery demand more in the long-run than in the short-run; fourth, expenditure effect is strong for gold jewellery demand while demand for gold bars responds little to any changes in import expenditure in the long-run and total gold demand is however moderately sensitive to expenditure movements. The results have important implications for anti-inflationary and anti-cyclical policymaking.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"This study analyzes the economic sustainability of the gold mining industry in Burkina Faso. For this purpose, the green gold GDP is used. First, the depreciation of gold stock was estimated using the concept of Hotelling rent and second, the environmental damage from gold mining companies was estimated. The human capital and the “double difference” approaches are used to estimate the environmental damage related to water and air quality deterioration. The results show that approximately 40% of the mining added value represents natural capital depreciation. The depreciation of natural capital is more important than mining revenues invested by the government. This study provides evidence that a sort of resource curse may exist, and as a result, a part of the resource rent is spent inefficiently.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"We examine the causal relation between oil and gold prices in the Indian context using the Hiemstra and Jones (1994) nonlinear Granger causality tests and nonlinear ARDL tests. The oil prices linearly Granger causes the gold prices in both short- and long-run. The results of Hiemstra and Jones (1994) nonlinear Granger causality test show a strong evidence of bidirectional nonlinear relation between oil and gold prices. The results of the nonlinear ARDL test reveal that positive shock in oil prices has more pronounced effect than negative shocks on gold prices. In the long-run, the relation between oil and gold prices is stickier towards upper side which emphasizes that gold prices are relatively more sensitive to increasing oil prices. We therefore conclude that the interactive mechanism between oil and gold prices is nonlinear and asymmetric.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"This paper uses interviews to examine the practices and perceptions of financial analysts related to their use of mining company technical reports prepared under Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. The results suggest that the information contained in the reports is used and useful for financial analysis, and demonstrate how they use it as an input to their valuation models. The analysts do, however, identify some concerns with the reports. These concerns relate to three areas: the experience of the “qualified person” with specific minerals; the independence of third-parties who provide assurance over the report; and the frequency of the reports. The implications of these results for future policy amendments include changes to the definition of a “qualified person” that should state a minimum number of years’ experience with specific minerals reported on, standards to disclose the relationship between third party assurance providers and the companies that engage them, and specific guidance over the materiality of events that trigger an updated report. Consideration of such policy amendments is relevant for accounting standard setters attempting to harmonize standards over the extractive industries, and for regulators that use mining disclosure codes that share similar “competent person”, independence, and technical reporting requirements.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"This paper examines coal production in China and reaches two primary conclusions: (1) Before 2014, the growth rate of coal production in China began to decrease, although coal production output had increased. In 2014, coal production declined because of China's growing dependence on imported coal. Net coal imports increased rapidly after 2008. Changes in coal stock should not be the primary manner in which the gap between production and supply is offset. Similar to the growth rate of coal production, investment in coal production decreased in 2013. The distribution of coal production was not balanced in China in 2013 because coal reserve distribution is not geographically homogeneous. (2) In the firm production field, the average total output value, inventory value and profit from coal mining and washing firms in China increased from 2007 to 2009. The operation status in this industry was not greatly influenced by large coal imports in 2009. Only a few coal production firms in China exported their product to foreign markets although the average export value to these exporters was considerable. The output elasticity of capital was larger than for labor and with decreasing returns to scale in the Chinese coal mining and washing industry between 2007 and 2009.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"Mining companies are increasingly called on to organize compensation activities for the villages close to mining sites, using a participatory approach. In the Guizhou Province of China, when a gold mine was opened, most of the land farmed in the surrounding villages was expropriated. The mining company set up a multi-stakeholder platform to identify compensation activities. The platform included representatives from the villages, local government, the mining company and a provincial university. The article examines the relations between the different actors and assesses the activities that were developed. The multi-stakeholder platform enabled some communication between participants, but village representatives had very little say in the decision-making. Many infrastructure projects were implemented, but most income-generating projects failed. The funding provided by the mining company did not compensate for the lack of institutional support for designing and implementing income-generating projects capable of providing sustainable livelihoods to the villagers.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"Persistent dependence on the extraction of oil, gas and minerals for export earnings and fiscal revenues poses concern for the sustainability of growth in resource-rich countries. Understanding the degree of dependence on these non-renewable resources and where the dependence originates from is helpful in crafting the right policies for diversification. To measure and monitor such dependence on resource extraction, we develop what we call the Extractives Dependence Index (EDI). The EDI is a composite index made up of three indicators: 1) the share of export earnings from extractives in total export earnings; 2) the share of revenue from extractives in total fiscal revenue; and 3) the extractive industry value added in GDP. We adjust each of these indicators to capture the productive capabilities in each country to determine the presence of alternative sources of export and tax revenues as well as industrial capacity for diversification, which are important for reducing dependence on extractive resources. The EDI ranks 81 countries in terms of their dependence on oil, gas and mineral extraction.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"China has an appalling record of fatalities in its coal mining industry. Moreover, the fatalities observed in township and village coal mines (TVCMs) is much more terrible than that in state-owned coal mines (SOCMs). The safety performance of coal mines is influenced not solely by governmental safety regulation, but by their embedded non-safety regulation games with their internal and external related industries. Therefore, to better understand the safety performances disparity in SOCMs and TVCMs, an embedded non-safety regulation game analysis of the two types of mines is introduced. The paper traces China's safety records of SOCMs and TVCMs, and then analyzes their embedded non-safety regulation games respectively. The result shows that the SOCMs are mainly embedded into non-safety regulation games with the national electric power enterprises, railway sectors, and coal transportation and marketing enterprises; and the TVCMs are mainly embedded into non-safety regulation games with some local government officials and related groups (e.g. local gangdom and journalists). Moreover, in the above embedded games, the SOCMs and TVCMs are often placed in a weaker bargaining position. Besides, the SOCMs and TVCMs also play internal games on coal output and safety. Overall, the SOCMs and TVCMs are embedded into a plurality of different non-safety regulation games which, at least in part, affect their safety investment decisions differently and lead to safety performance disparity eventually.",Volume 51,March 2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/51/suppl/C,8
"This study applies the bounds testing approach to cointegration to the daily data from 01-December-1997 to 15-July-2016, in order to investigate the relationships between the prices of two strategic commodities (oil and gold) and the macro-financial variables (interest rate, exchange rate and stock price) in Japan, a major oil-consuming-and-importing as well as gold-holding-and-exporting country. The results suggest that oil prices seem to have limited information for the Japanese policy-makers in the long run. In the short run, however, oil and gold prices seem to have more useful information to presage fluctuations in the Japanese macro-financial variables including stock price and interest rate.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"This article examines the application of social risk in the global mining industry. The current approach to social risk conflates risk to people and risk to projects. We argue that differentiation is needed to determine the respective attributes of both risk types and to understand how and where they interact. Establishing a clear understanding about where a risk is directed is important from multiple vantage points: due diligence, risk and liability management and social protections. A key contribution in this article is the demonstration of 'rebound dynamics' surrounding social risk. The authors argue that social risks can generate impacts across a range of institutions, boundaries and factors. Understanding the workings of social risk in this dynamic space is critical for ensuring that the industry addresses social harm as part of its commitments to sustainable development.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"Linkages between oil and 25 other commodity prices are examined using annual data for 1900 to 2011. We identify long-run relationships using both linear and nonlinear ARDL models and capture short-run causalities through asymmetric Granger causality tests. Nonlinearity can’t be rejected for the relationship between oil and most other commodity prices. Long-run positive impacts of oil price increases are found for 20 commodities and short-run negative impacts for 13 commodity prices. Oil prices don’t have much impact on beverage or cereal prices once endogeneity is accounted for, but they have substantial impact on metal prices.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"This paper presents a literature review of the academic literature that covers real option analysis in the context of metal mining investments. Real options are of growing importance in metal mining, because of increased uncertainty of markets and complexity of new projects. The central promise of real option valuation methods applied to project analysis is to both hedge and enhance expected economic returns. The reviewed literature is sorted on the basis of the valuation approach used and by the type of real options studied. The distinction between real options “on projects” and “in projects” is made and discussed.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"The Korean government planned to remediate the soil contaminated with heavy metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, and lead, in Janghang copper smelter (JCS). The policy-makers are demanding a figure about the public value of the remediation. Therefore, this paper describes an attempt to measure the public value, applying the contingent valuation (CV) method. To this end, we conducted a CV survey of 1000 households in Korea in 2015. We used a one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice question to derive the willingness to pay (WTP) responses, and utilized a spike model to analyze zero WTP responses. The mean WTP was computed to be KRW 1627 (USD 1.37) per household per year and statistically meaningful at the 1% level. Expanding the value to the national population gives us KRW 30.4 billion (USD 25.7 million) per year. The present value of the total public value for the next ten years reaches KRW 241.7 billion (USD 204.0 million), using a social discount rate of 5.5%. We can conclude that Korean households are ready to shoulder some of the financial burden for contaminated soil remediation in JCS. Moreover, we conducted economic feasibility analysis of the remediation and found that it is socially profitable.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"In spite of the growing popularity of this endeavor, it can be argued that it is not a corporation's primary objective to advance development in areas where they operate. However, due to prevailing community concerns and the negative ramifications of their activities on local livelihoods, they tend to embrace this idea both in discourse and actual corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Thus, our goal is not to argue that mining companies have not embraced the notion of ‘sustainable development’. Instead, we seek to highlight the discrepancy that exists between practices they consider to be sustainable and the experiences and perceptions of local communities regarding such activities. Based on our analysis of two gold mining companies in Ghana, we suggest that this discrepancy prevails due to the mere focus on land reclamation and other disjointed CSR programs instead of a more nuanced framework that places affected communities at its core.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"Coal prices in China has risen steadily and been unusually volatile because of the state's contradictory policies in coal sector. This paper sets up a multi-layer perceptron network model to make short terms prediction after identifying the chaotic characteristics of coal price. Coal prices of Qinhuangdao port are selected as the experiment data. Firstly, coal price time series was studied from the chaotic point of view. Three classic indicators: the maximum Lyapunov exponent, the correlation dimension and the Kolmogorov entropy are adopted to verify the chaotic characteristic. Then a multi-layer perceptron model is proposed to predict the trend of the chaotic coal price.

"The European Commission identified a group of materials that were claimed to be critical due to their high economic importance and high supply constraints, which could become bottlenecks for the deployment of emerging technologies and enabling sustainable production. Currently this discourse takes place at the industrial system level from a policy perspective, and it is unclear if what is perceived by policy circles as critical could be true for manufacturing operations. This paper explores how five EU manufacturing companies in different sectors and supply chains see materials criticality, and their strategies to mitigate such criticality. On the one hand, the results indicate the limited scope of the criticality factors and employed mitigation strategies considered, compared to those established in the literature. On the other hand, the findings point to the existence of interdependences between companies within and between supply chains, which should be incorporated into the materials criticality assessment, if viable implications for the industrial systems are to be developed. The paper concludes by discussing the implications for manufacturing companies and policy-makers, and suggests prospects for further research.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"Resource funds have been widely defended in the theoretical literature as a solution to the resource curse. In this work, empirical analyses of a sample of 28 resource-rich countries over the period 1985–2010 do not support this argument. Rather, the results indicate that resource funds have a negative and significant effect on growth and that this finding is robust under alternative estimation techniques. Moreover, the results do not validate the hypothesis of the resource curse due to the positive effect of resource dependence on growth. Finally, the study provides evidence that the negative component of the curse is captured by the resource funds. The implications in terms of natural resources funds management are discussed.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"Since developed countries have contributed most of the greenhouse gas emissions currently responsible for climate change, should they pay all or most of the costs for needed climate change policies? The original polluter pays principle contends that firms and in turn countries should be charged for the full costs to society of their current pollution. This policy promotes both efficiency and common perceptions of equity. The historic polluter pays principle—a modification of the original polluter pays principle used to argue that developed countries should pay most of the costs for climate policies—contends that the costs of remediating past pollution should be allocated according to their past pollution. For various reasons, however, the historic polluter pays principle does not promote efficiency nor even equity. So those who advocate that the developed countries shoulder the lion's share of climate policy costs need to use other arguments. Moreover, regardless of how the costs are allocated, the original producer pays principle should be implemented so that current producers pay the full costs to society of their greenhouse gas emissions wherever they are located. These findings are of interest to the mineral and energy sectors since global climate policies will substantially affect these sectors. Moreover, one can extend the findings to remediation policies for all past pollution, including for example the cleaning up of old historic mining sites.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"Due to the uneven geographical distribution of rare earths (RE), most countries obtain RE on the international market. Trade patterns and trading countries’ role characteristics are two important aspects to understand the current status of world RE trade and furthermore to formulate RE trade policies for each trading country. A complex network theory is adopted to analyze the world RE trade based on the trading data of 2011–2015. The results show that world RE trade favors a tendency towards collectivization since 146 trading countries only form three trade communities. Of these communities, the one headed by the United States, China, Japan, and Germany, has the largest clustering coefficient and has the greatest effect on the world RE trade. Moreover, the average path length valued by 2.294 steps in the network shows that the trading countries are quite close to each other, i.e., building up trade relations between any two countries needs an average path length of only 2.294 steps. Based on the role characteristics analysis of the degree centrality, strength centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and betweenness centrality, our study characterized the competing and complementary relationships between the major trading countries.

"Rare earths are important strategic mineral resources and have been widely used for economic development and national security. The Chinese government has carried out some policies to promote the process of rare earth industrial integration. Our study constructed a two-stage game-theoretic model to analyze the industrial integration tendency of rare earth firms. Three integration scenarios have been established, including no integration, horizontal integration between upstream firms and vertical integration between upstream and downstream firms. The results show that firms and the Chinese government prefer different modes of rare earth industry integration. For rare earths firms, they would like to carry out horizontal integration to maximize their profits, while the Chinese government would encourage the vertical integration between upstream and downstream firms to realize the maximization of social welfare. Finally, the Chinese government would like to make out some policies to guide the rare earth firms to implement vertical rather than horizontal integration.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"In response to high mortality rates and low productivity in coal mining, China began regulating coal mines in the 1990s, reshaping its coal economy. We investigate the relationship between coal mine regulation and economic growth. Using the difference-in-difference approach to compare the pre- and post-regulation periods as well as regions heavily and lightly affected by regulation, we find that regulation positively affects a regional economy. Results are illustrated by estimations that use mortality rates in coal mining as a proxy for measuring regulation quality. Regulation effects are not limited to the intra-coal industry but also apply to spillover by relieving the crowding-out effects of coal abundance.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"For many years, the use of mercury in Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining has afforded an income for many persons without better options, but has brought with it extensive harm to the environment, the miners and their communities. Technical and financial assistance have focused on raising awareness of the affected mining communities and encouraging the transition to mercury-free techniques. However, relatively little research has examined the roles of the stakeholders in the mercury supply chain, and their ability to influence the mercury-free transition. This paper analyzes the stakeholders and their diverse roles with regard to the trade and supply of mercury for Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining. The paper applies a supply chain management approach to stakeholder theory. This is done through an extensive literature review, a qualitative content analysis, an online survey and the development of supply chain diagrams that were validated by experts in the field. By providing a comprehensive picture of the stakeholders and their roles, this paper helps governments, inter- and non-governmental organizations and others to better understand stakeholders and their interactions with the mercury supply chain at multiple levels, permitting the development of appropriate policies within the context of the Minamata Convention on Mercury, and the preparation of better adapted National Action Plans.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"The dependence on imported energy sources is one of the biggest challenges that Turkey and many other similar countries face in the 21st Century and the gap between production and consumption cannot be decreased without increasing the domestic production. Forecasting of domestic energy production therefore plays a vital role in order to be able to develop sound energy policies towards maintaining sustainable development. However, although this question is essential in this respect especially for import dependent countries, the previous literature is surprisingly scarce. This paper, therefore, will be important for future studies on estimation of energy production. We first analyzed lignite production of Turkish Coal Enterprises (TKI) from a historical perspective and then forecasted the future production by using the Hubbert curve, depletion rate, and decline curve methodologies. We concluded that the largest fields are about to enter a declining phase of production in upcoming years and most of the reserves will remain untapped if business-as-usual continues in the future.

The study drew on emergent research that finds smaller companies, which are less subject to scrutiny by external stakeholders such as NGOs, media and investors, understand and practice CSR differently to the multinational companies which have dominated extant research. The study found that CSR meaning and practice in this large, but little researched, group of companies was highly context-based and community focused, in marked contrast to the strategies and practices of larger resources companies operating in developing nations.

"For the past decades, the strong performance of the mining industry has been largely attributed to the surging mineral prices. To assess this claim, this paper examines the performance of the mining sector in Ghana over the past 40 years. It basically, provides a historical context of the dynamics and forces driving the strong performance of the mining industry with specific focus on gold mining. Using revenue as the performance metric, we decompose the growth in gold mining revenue into three components: the pure price, pure output (production) and the correlation effects. The analysis shows that although surging gold prices have certainly played a role in driving the strong performance of the sector, even more important a factor is the strong correlation between price and output. Over 70% of the growth in mining revenue resulted from the strong and positive correlation between output and price growth. In addition, given the strong demand for gold at the international market, particularly, from China, the study identifies a combination of complementary forces such as policies, investment flows and improvement in technology as underlying and driving this strong correlation effect. On this basis, the paper recommends that the government should continue to implement policies that promote a good business environment, and attract and sustain investment flow into the mining sector.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9

"Worldwide coal mining has expanded over the past few decades, though growth has recently slowed due to reduced demand, partly due to concerns around CO2 emissions and climate change impacts. Coal mining is also a significant driver of land disturbance in regions where economic coal seams and coal mining methods are applied, in particular open cut extraction. To address these impacts, mined landscapes are rehabilitated with the aim of making them safe, stable, non-polluting and self-sustainable to an agreed post-mining land use such as agriculture or conservation. Progressive rehabilitation is often conducted to keep the footprint of disturbance to a minimum and to ensure that ecological and/or agricultural land use production is restored as soon as possible in preference to waiting until after mine closure. Environmental regulators require methods for tracking the performance of mining companies engaging in progressive rehabilitation to evaluate the success or otherwise of their regulatory frameworks and to ensure companies meet the requirements of their environmental authorities or mining licenses.In this study, we describe a spatial method for assessing mine disturbance and rehabilitation regionally and analyse our results in terms of rehabilitation liability. We first developed a land cover classification framework for mapping mining impacts and rehabilitation that categorises land cover using a mining land cover disturbance typology. We then used the Fitzroy Basin in Australia as a case study, utilising the land cover classification scheme to map 37 open cut-coal mines, using manual interpretation of remote sensing data. By comparing the percentage area of rehabilitation with the total mine area we assessed the variability in progressive rehabilitation for the 37 mines. For example, older mines which have a history of progressive rehabilitation should have large areas and a high proportion of area rehabilitated. Finally, we calculated a range of regional rehabilitation liabilities by applying two publically available rehabilitation cost-calculators to the land cover data. We calculated the rehabilitation liability as ranging from $2.7 to $5.5 billion Australian dollars. The lower and upper bounds of the estimate reflect the uncertainty associated with the range of land use types and potential rehabilitation methods, from simple to more complex rehabilitation methods. We conclude by discussing how the methods could be used to support effective decision making by government agencies regulating and monitoring mining activities.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"Local content requirement policies typically call for a foreign investor to source a portion of its procurements from local suppliers in the domestic economy. Local content requirement policies have long been studied for various industries, and there is currently a vibrant debate on their design or implementation in extractive industries, such as minerals, oil, or gas, especially in resource-rich low-income countries. Our objective in this paper is to characterise optimal local content requirement policies in the context of extractive industries. If an optimal local content requirement policy serves to monetise the positive externalities from foreign investment, then it is, in essence, a Pigouvian subsidy, which is a first-best policy, but the incremental volume of business which it may induce is a function not only of the size of the positive externalities but also of the response of local suppliers to new business opportunities. We discuss four implications: providing high-powered incentives for investor compliance, harvesting the investor's superior information, managing the host government's administrative burden, and mitigating the risk of infantilising local suppliers.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"The paper reviews coal bed methane developments and their regulation in the states of Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Queensland, like Pennsylvania in terms of shale gas developments in the US, has adopted a ‘go grow’ and a learning-by-doing approach to gas extraction. In Queensland, this approach has supported the rapid development of coal-bed methane as an energy source for domestic use, and since 2014, for export markets. By contrast, New South Wales has adopted a ‘go slow’ approach akin to that followed by New York State in terms of shale gas, but for coal-bed methane extraction. The different pathways followed by the two states allows for a comparison of regulatory change, why regulations have differed, and their benefits and costs. Differences are explained by: (1) the dynamic and fragile nature of a ‘social licence’; (2) the nature of the local concerns in the two states; and (3) how and why individuals and communities might support resource developments that impose environmental and other risks.

"Based on the panel data of 30 sub-sub-sectors of China's nonferrous metal industry from 2004 to 2013, this paper utilizes a global data envelopment analysis (DEA) to analyze the total-factor productivity (TFP) of China's nonferrous metal industry from both static and dynamic perspectives. We present the fluctuation of TFP in the nonferrous metal industry during 2004–2013 and analyze the key factors responsible for this fluctuation from the perspectives of production techniques, management and scale. The static analysis results show that the overall TFP of China's nonferrous metal industry is relatively low, and production inefficiency in the mining and smelting industries are two primary sources of this overall TFP inefficiency. There are significant differences among the 30 sub-sub-sectors in TFPs. During our sample period, some sub-sub-sectors experienced rapid growth in TFP, while others remained at a low level. The dynamic analysis results show differences in the key factors affecting the TFPs of three sub-sectors. Technical progress was the biggest contributor to the TFP growth in the nonferrous metal smelting sector, while the rapid increase in scale efficiency was the primary source of TFP growth in both the nonferrous metal mining sector and the pressing and processing sector.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9

"Objective of this study is to empirically investigate the time varying co-movements between crude oil and Indian stock market returns both at aggregate and sector level. This study uses weekly closing prices for Brent Crude, BSE-Sensex and seven sector indices of Bombay Stock Exchange namely Automotive, Energy, Financial, Industrial, Metal, Oil & Gas and Power as data input. The data span of this study runs from January 1, 2006 to Feb 28, 2015, which encompasses the booming, recessionary and the recovering phase of global as well as Indian economy. The paper deploys VAR-DCC-GARCH framework. Three versions of GARCH namely standard, threshold and exponential and both symmetric and asymmetric versions of dynamic contemporaneous correlations have been used. Results of the study indicate that direct volatility spill over from oil market to Indian stock market is not significant at the aggregate level; however, it is significant in case of auto, power and finance sector. Parameter of dynamic correlations and volatility were significant thereby providing empirical evidence of the time varying differential dependence of Indian stock sector indices on oil price fluctuations.

"This paper examines how shocks in the U.S. mineral resource extraction (MRE) industry impact MRE-dependent counties using county level data between 1970- and 2012. A difference-in-difference fixed effects model and a spatial modeling to incorporate spatial heterogeneity and dependence among U.S. local areas that are in close geographical proximity are employed in this study. The results show that MRE industry employment grew faster during boom periods and slower during the bust period in MRE dependent counties. MRE earnings and earnings per worker grew slower during boom periods and faster during the bust period. The findings give evidence of negative spatial indirect spillover effects between neighboring counties’ MRE sector labor markets. An analysis of the effect of shocks in the MRE sector on the non-MRE sectors shows that in MRE dependent counties non-MRE sector employment grew slower during boom periods and faster during the bust period. Positive shocks in the MRE sector had no effect on the manufacturing sector labor market; however, negative shocks had a positively effect. Booms in the MRE sector positively impacted the construction sector, while negatively affecting the service and retail trade sectors’ labor markets in MRE dependent counties. Finally, this study finds that male population grew faster, while female population grew slower in the MRE dependent counties.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9

"One of the surprising findings in the economic literature is that natural resource-rich countries tend to have slower economic growth than resource-poor countries do, i.e., the natural resource curse and Dutch disease. In this paper, we revisit these issues by applying quantile regression and using the most updated data. The results demonstrate that resource-intensive countries in 1970 suffered from slower economic growth than did resource-poor countries over the next 20 years, consistent with Sachs and Warner, 1995, Sachs and Warner, 1997, Sachs and Warner, 2001. However, contrary to our initial expectation, we find that the natural resource abundance in 1990 had positive impacts on economic growth between 1990 and 2010. We further test Dutch disease theory, and the result contradicts the Dutch disease hypothesis. Overall, our analysis suggests that in the period from 1970 to 1990, the hypotheses of a resource curse and Dutch disease hold. However, in the period from 1990 to 2010, these hypotheses no longer hold because manufacturing sectors have grown sufficiently even in resource-rich countries.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"Complex polymetallic mining projects with multiple processing streams tend to require tight blending constraints, with different operational and processing targets. These blending requirements are generally not focused solely on metal grade, but rather on a set of geometallurgical variables that affect the performance of the operation and its ability to meet targets and maximize project value. Because of this, a multivariate destination policy is developed here, based on coalition formation clustering (a line of study of cooperative game theory), which avoids the use of cut-off grades and defines where material is sent by accounting for the value and relation of groups of blocks being processed together. This allows improving investment decisions as a result of optimizing project performance, because the variables that affect blending and processing requirements are actively accounted for in the optimization process. A case study on a copper-gold mine with six destinations is presented, where the method proposed shows significant improvements in meeting processing requirements and increases the expected net present value by 5.6% when compared to a traditional method. This shows that complex processing requirements can be accounted for and respected without any loss of project value.",Volume 50,December 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/50/suppl/C,9
"The regional impacts of large development projects often require rapid appraisal in confined geographies. Impacts have largely been studied at country level, which have often neglected a finer granularity of analysis at sub-national level, which has specific relevance in Africa, since many mineral conflicts on the continent are highly localised. This study applies Q-methodology to quantitatively analyse qualitative perspectives regarding impacts of mining-led development at a district level in Rwanda – a densely populated country with a high economic growth rate. This approach revealed three classes of shared perspectives regarding topics of greatest concern to stakeholders: (a) economic diversification and sustainable socioeconomic development; (b) employment, resettlement, and mining land-use; and (c) income, benefit distribution, and social impacts. The use of this method to consolidate qualitative data through a deliberative process to get an output that can be used for broader geographic comparisons holds much promise for researchers and practitioners alike working in geographies of rapid development.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"“Resource curse” phenomenon emerged as the greatest challenge for the social sustainable development in China's new normal stage. The paper looked into the changes of generalized regional “resource curse” with observations of data from 1998 to 2013 years by using a spatial dynamic panel data model; and the paper further explored the key factors and mechanism of generalized regional “resource curse” with Chinese northeast region as an example. The results showed: when considering the losses of resources using and environment pollution in social development, generalized “resource curse” did not exist in national level, but appeared in some regions such as Yellow River center region, northeast region and northwest region; and more complicated in Yangtze River center region and southwest region due to their specific conditions. Several important variables including resources and environment regulation policy, economy policy, regional location might be important factors. Regional location had a more significant impact on regional development, but if from a longer time latitude, increasingly stricter resources and environment regulation policy could make generalized regional “resource curse” less happen, but the impacts by regional location might be even more important.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"New legal frameworks for oil and gas have been created in Ghana, Uganda, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya and Liberia since 2013 to put in place local content policies (LCPs). There are a number of reasons why such policies have become popular with African governments for petroleum and mining. Beginning with Angola and Nigeria and moving to the newer adopters of these policies, a general weakening of oil and gas LCPs in Sub-Saharan Africa indicates a ‘softer’ approach to regulation over time and a the emergence of a more pro-business agenda. This paper seeks to conduct an in-depth survey of LCPs in oil and gas across Sub-Saharan Africa in order to identify differing approaches and analyze emerging trends in the legal and institutional frameworks within which local content frameworks are enacted and within which they will be implemented in order to advance petro-development in Africa.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"During the early 21st century, the world market prices for minerals increased dramatically. As a consequence of this development, large investments were made in mining all around the world. Increased exploration activities, the opening of new mines and large investment schemes in already operating mines and related physical infrastructure also gave rise to a “mining boom” in the remote and sparsely populated areas of northern Sweden. New jobs were generated in the mining sector, but the question of whether the “mining boom” also has stimulated economic development in a broader sense in these areas has been more open. The present article investigated whether labour incomes have increased not only in sectors clearly connected to mining, but also in other parts of the local and regional economy. This was done by following the income changes of residents in the mining areas of northern Sweden over the time period 2004–2010 and by using a propensity score matching estimator method (PSM). The results show rapid income growth for employees in the mining industry and construction sectors, but also some growth in several other sectors, indicating spread effects to the rest of the local and regional economies. The impact, however, is much stronger in the largest mining towns than in communities where mining is of less significance.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) sets the standard in revenue transparency in 46 countries and works under the assumption that compliance with the initiative will improve transparency and curb corruption in member states. However, individual case studies raise doubts about the success of the initiative. Building upon the literatures on compliance and governance, this paper analyzes the impact of EITI membership on transparency and corruption levels between 2006 and 2013. By using interrupted time series and panel data analyses, this research makes an original contribution to show that affiliation with the EITI immediately improved overall aggregate data disclosure in member countries in this period. At the same time, the paper also shows that perceptions of corruption did not change. This outcome questions the effectiveness of promoting only a narrow definition of transparency in extractive industries as a measure to prevent corruption. The results imply that a more comprehensive treatment of transparency might be necessary; specifically to distinguish regimes that use transparency reforms for public relations purposes as opposed to genuine reformers.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"The discussers appreciate application of a multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique for green vendor evaluation and selection. The original paper properly applied analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique to provide a robust and consistent assessment mechanism on the basis of pairwise comparisons. The authors also designed a framework to perform sensitivity analysis which was an effective measure to alleviate subjectivity of the judgments. However, an important point regarding the concept of uncertainty was neglected by the authors. Throughout the current text, the discussers would like to draw attention of readers to a crucial point that can alleviate the uncertainty in the current MCDM process. Focus of the present discussion is on integration of fuzzy set numbers with AHP which can help the analysts to provide more viable outcomes.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is now well known concept which is widely used in practice by mining companies, both large and small. The main role of CSR for mining companies is to ensure a responsible business venture to reduce potential risks arising from safety issues and a potential negative environmental footprint and to attract better employees and gain acceptance among local society. However the scope and function of CSR activities depend not only on the profile and size of companies, but also on the area where they conduct their mining operations (value to society), so sometimes it could be unclear what function CSR plays in developing economies. Therefore the aim of the paper is to discuss how multinational corporations have developed their CSR policies, and to what extent they have adopted these policies in developing countries. Moreover the goal of this article is to compare their activities with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) operating in different regions of the world. It was shown that large copper producers have a long term policy on CSR and conduct a wide scope of CSR activities which depend on local needs, whereas SMEs are focused on solving ad-hoc issues rather than developing long-term strategic relations. SMEs have already recognised the need to strengthen their social policies on engaging with communities in order to protect their human rights and avoid negative outcomes, mostly in more remote locations. At the same time the companies analysed recognise the fact that as demand for resources increases, the potential for a negative impact on communities and social conflicts also rises.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"The question of how adopting local content policy (LC policy) benefits the economic growth of developing oil-rich countries is hardly new but is a continuous debate that often centers on increasing the value-added that LC policy can create within the oil industry. However, the level to which LC policy can achieve this goal in some of these countries has not yet been ascertained. In Nigeria, the impact of LC policy on local value creation has generated divergent speculation. This study addresses this gap by assessing the impact of LC policy in influencing local value creation with particular reference to indigenous oil firms’ participation, backward linkages and job creation. Structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was applied to analyze the data obtained from a survey of 209 local oil and gas firms in the Niger Delta. Our findings confirm that LC policy has a positive and significant impact on local value creation. However, we found that local value created in the Nigerian oil industry as a consequence of LC policy is lower than the expected target. This implies that the implementation of the policy needs to be closely monitored to ensure its efficacy towards increasing economic development.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10

We contribute to this research by using a novel nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test to study how measures of policy and equity-market uncertainty affect gold-price returns and volatility. For daily and monthly data, we find evidence of causality running from various uncertainty measures to both gold returns and volatility. For quarterly data, evidence of causality weakens and is significant only for some uncertainty measures and only for gold volatility.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"The aim of this paper is to analyse in detail the “Pan-European Standard for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Reserves,” which is commonly known as the PERC Reporting Standard.This research examines investor presentations, stock exchange announcements, the results of definitive feasibility studies, competent person reports and company reports from three ready-to-go investments in new tungsten mining projects around the world: the Barruecopardo open-cut tungsten project in Salamanca, Spain, the Hemerdon open-cut tungsten and tin project in Devon, United Kingdom, and the Sangdong underground tungsten project in South Korea.These case studies were selected because the projects are being developed by companies that are listed on European stock exchanges and have already obtained funding (Hemerdon and Barruecopardo) or are in advanced negotiations or have agreed to terms for funding (Sangdong).The conclusions of this research clearly define the direction in which future mining reporting standards should develop, mainly to address the weaknesses that were found in the results of feasibility studies that are presented to investors about the capital costs, net present value and internal rate of return calculations, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and forecasted mineral prices, which are crucial for making sound investment decisions.These conclusions also consider the benefits of coupling the Competent Person's areas of specialization and the reported results with both the required relevant experience in the different fields of expertise and the type of corporate membership, registration or licensure by a recognised professional body.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"For more than a century, the use of mineral resources has increased exponentially with annual growth percentages of between 4% and 6%. While for most mineral resources, depletion is not an issue, for some mineral resources the current level of extraction is likely to pose a problem for future generations. Depletion of a mineral resource means that its enriched deposits will have been extracted, and consequently it will become much more expensive for future generations to continue to use these minerals. While technology may reduce some of the adverse effects of depletion, future generations may be deprived of potential innovations for which these specific materials would be essential. The question arises as to how the currently unsustainable extraction of mineral resources can be decreased to safeguard them for future generations. It is submitted that it is unlikely that market forces alone will sufficiently impact the prices of minerals to resolve the unsustainable use of certain minerals timely enough. In this article, it is posited that an international agreement on the conversation and sustainable use of geologically scarce minerals is necessary. The agreement will recognize that the geological scarcity of mineral resources differs between different minerals. It will therefore make a selection of priority minerals, determine how far the extraction rate of these substances must be reduced and decide on a fixed time period within which the extraction must decrease from the current rate to a sustainable rate. The design of such an agreement will be based on two basic principles contained in existing international environmental agreements: (1) the inter-generational equity principle and (2) the principle of conservation of natural resources. Furthermore, the obligatory reduction of the extraction of mineral resources will affect the sovereign rights of resource countries to exploit their own resources. Therefore, any international agreement should make arrangements to ensure resource countries are adequately compensated for their loss of income.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"The extractable ores of the world's geologically scarcest mineral resources (e.g. antimony, molybdenum and zinc) may be exhausted within several decades to a century, if their extraction continues to increase. This paper explores the likelihood that these scarce mineral resources can be conserved in time for future generations without intervening but instead simply relying on the price mechanism of the free market system. First we discuss the role of geological scarcity in the long-term price development of mineral resources. Then, to see whether geological scarcity affects the price of minerals we compare the historical trends in the prices of geologically scarce mineral resources with those of geologically more abundant mineral resources. The results show that in the period 1900–2013 the price mechanism did not result in high prices that provide advance warning of exhaustion of minerals. We therefore argue that if conservation is left to market forces, it is not certain that geologically scarce minerals will be timely, automatically, and sufficiently conserved for future generations. We recommend preparing international policy measures targeted at a price increase of the scarcest mineral resources, in order to accelerate substitution and recycling of these materials and help save the geologically scarcest mineral resources for future generations.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"Our study compares production costs of the non-ferrous metals (NFM) industry in the European Union (EU) and other countries in order to understand whether these costs are higher in Europe. Our analysis focuses on copper and zinc, since they are considered to be the most greatly consumed non-ferrous metals after aluminium. The countries selected for comparison depend on the metal and are based on high shares of extra-EU28 trade and/or of global installed capacity. A bottom-up approach has been followed, based on information at facility level for primary production of the two metals. The analysis includes 32 copper smelters, 34 copper refineries and 23 zinc smelters, representing 72%, 58% and 30% of global production of copper anodes, cathodes and zinc slab respectively. Taking into consideration the complex structure of the industry, costs are broken down to three components: (1) Energy, (2) Labour and other costs (salaries, consumables and other on-site costs) and (3) Credits (due to co-products). Our findings suggest that although interesting observations emerge in each of these components, overall costs compare more favourably among countries than initially thought. The EU industry does not have the highest production costs. On the contrary, especially in the case of copper refineries and zinc, it has lower production costs than most of the countries included in the study.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10

"We examine the impact of large upward/downward oil price movements on metal prices and the asymmetric response of metal prices to large oil price movements. We use copulas to characterize dependence between oil and metal price returns and we quantify spillover effects by computing the unconditional and conditional value-at-risk. Taking price data for ten metals – six industrial (aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc) and four precious (gold, silver, palladium and platinum) – widely traded on the London Metal Exchange for the period 2000 to 2015, our empirical evidence indicates that large downward and upward oil price movements had spillover effects on all these metals both before and after the outbreak of the global financial crisis. The fact that spillovers for upward oil price movements were larger than for downward oil price movements provides evidence of asymmetric spillover effects. Our results have implications for downside and upside risk management for investors and manufacturers.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"In an open pit mining operation, the heterogeneity of the grade-tonnage distribution of the deposit dictates that all available material within the boundaries of an open pit may not be processed. Given this heterogeneity, it is imperative that the valuable (ore) and waste materials are clearly identified. In this context, the cut-off grade defines the quantity of ore and waste, ensuring smooth supply of ore to the processing streams. While, the earliest significant effort towards the development of models for cut-off grade policy dates back to 1960s, a number of contributions on this vital aspect of a mining operation have been made since then. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the available literature on cut-off grade policy models and suggests possible areas of future research.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"The rising imbalance between increased demand for minerals and their tighter supply has resulted in growing concerns about their criticality. This has in turn stimulated both resource-rich and resource-poor countries to take an active role in implementing mineral strategies. The present paper explains why different world regions responded differently to the global problem of securing stable supply of critical minerals, in particular of rare earths. The paper is based on a comparative political economy framework and examines the extent to which distinct national policy styles, national interests, resource endowment and historical experience in tackling supply risk shaped the different policy choices. The overall findings show that despite their similar objectives, strategies undertaken by various regions tend to differ in their foci. Whereas Europe opts for a policy dialogue with resource-rich countries, Japan and the United States have a more hands-on approach in research and development initiatives. Australia's and China's policies instead, focus on development of domestic mining activities and on resource protection.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10

These in return have relations with the economy of the country, best reflected in the stock market index. This study aims to explore the relation between global prices of gold, crude oil, the USD–INR exchange rate, and the stock market in India. The dynamic contemporaneous linkages have been analyzed using DCC-GARCH (standard, exponential and threshold) models and the lead lag linkages have been examined using symmetric and asymmetric Non Linear Causality tests. Empirical analyses indicate fall in gold prices and crude oil prices cause fall in the value of the Indian Rupee and the benchmark stock index i.e. Sensex.

A methodology is developed which draws on supply chains and published feasibility studies, emphasizing timely data certainty as significant factor of exploration project feasibility. For 2014, our findings for the Greenlandic project exploration proposals reveal that Kvanefjeld would significantly exceed EU demand except for Eu, on which it would undersupply. In contrast, Kringlerne would undersupply on La, Ce and Pr, oversupply on Nd and Y, and on all heavy REE with the exception of Eu.

"The aim of the article is to compare the qualification process of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) applied for mining projects in the Visegrad Group countries (V4). Poland is a major producer of copper and silver, the Czech Republic produces kaolin and uranium, Slovakia – magnesite and Hungary – bauxite. Despite significant differences in mineral reserves in the mentioned countries, mineral deposits are treated as important natural resources that are the basis for development of power industry, construction industry and other various industrial branches. The paper determines importance of the qualification in the EIA procedure. In the next part, criteria and thresholds of the qualification of the EIA procedure resulting from division of projects depending on the possibility of significant environmental impact have been described. It has been shown that there are large differences in thresholds which qualify mining projects in the discussed countries to the EIA procedure. In comparison with the European Union EIA Directive, the V4 countries have more detailed (expanded) division of qualification criteria. Slovakia is the best example when concerning division of projects into particular types, while Polish solutions present the most detailed set of qualification criteria. In the Czech Republic, any new mining project is the subject to the mandatory EIA procedure, and in Hungary they are always the subject to the screening stage. Exploration works are the subject to the qualification process only in Poland and Hungary. They are based on such parameters as the depth of a given borehole and occurrence of other protected resources (groundwater, animated nature, etc.). The criteria and thresholds for the selection of projects that may potentially have significant impact on the environment also considerably differ in the degree of details and even units. The authors raise the question whether it is intentional or accidental, emphasising that the lack of precision in this area makes exploitation of mineral resources more complicated. It should be also emphasised that the EIA procedure is one of the most important instruments of environmental management allowing to achieve sustainable economic development.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"This paper discusses the missing case of Iran and tests the resource curse hypothesis using the updated time-series data over the extended period of 1965–2011. This study incorporates economic growth as a function of natural resources, exports, capital and labor in a Cobb–Douglas production function. The results of Bayer-Hanck combined cointegration test confirm that the underlying variables are cointegrated, while the finding from the long-run analysis validate the resource curse hypothesis and suggest that the natural resource impede economic growth in Iran. A 1% increase in natural resource production results in a 0.47% decline in GDP. This suggests that the exploitation of natural resources negatively affects the competitiveness of other sectors and limits their ability to contribute to economic growth. Furthermore, the results of the causal analysis conclude that there is a feedback effect between natural resource abundance and economic growth. These findings are useful for the development of policy controls in the case of Iran.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"Phosphate rock contains significant amounts of uranium, although in low concentrations. Recovery of uranium as a by-product from phosphoric acid, an intermediate product produced during the recovery of phosphorus from phosphate rock, is not unprecedented. Phosphoric acid plants ceased to produce uranium as a by-product in the early 1990s with the fall of uranium prices. In the last decade, this topic has regained attention due to higher uranium prices and expected increase in demand for uranium. This study revisits the topic and estimates how much uranium might be recoverable from current phosphoric acid production in the United States and what the associated costs might be considering two different recovery processes: solvent extraction and ion exchange.Based on U.S. phosphoric acid production in 2014, 5.5 million pounds of U3O8 could have been recovered, which is more than domestic U.S. mine production in the same year (4.9 million pounds U3O8). In comparison, uranium demand from U.S. nuclear plants in the same year was 53 million pounds U3O8 of which nearly 10% could have been met by uranium from phosphoric acid production. Annualized costs for a hypothetical uranium recovery plant are US$44–61 per pound U3O8 for solvent extraction, the process used historically in the United States to recover uranium from phosphoric acid. For ion exchange, not yet proven at a commercial scale for uranium recovery, the estimated costs are US$33–54 per pound U3O8. These results suggest that it is technically possible for the United States to recover significant quantities of uranium from current phosphoric acid production. For this type of uranium production to be economically attractive on a large scale, either recovery costs must fall or uranium prices rise.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"This paper offers preliminary reflections on the direction and impact of the emerging ‘ethical minerals’ agenda, focusing specifically on the case of sub-Saharan Africa. Over the past two decades, the mining industry in this region has experienced profound change, reshaped by large injections of foreign investment. During this period, host governments have redrafted fiscal policies in an attempt to attract multinational mining and exploration companies. These moves, however, have stifled the regularization of artisanal and small-scale mine operators, hundreds of thousands of whom have struggled to secure their own permits due to a lack of available land, the exorbitant costs of legalizing their activities, and excessively-bureaucratic registration processes. Ethical mineral schemes and standards, which seek to connect producers to consumers, have been championed as potential mechanisms for alleviating the hardships of these operators. But further analysis reveals that there is considerable discrepancy between the implied and at times, stated, aims and impacts of the interventions being piloted/implemented in the region on the one hand, and what is actually happening in practice on the other hand. The analysis serves as a stark reminder that the ethical mineral schemes and standards being piloted/implemented are not development interventions, as is often believed.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"Evaluations concerning the EITI's strategic contribution to sustainable development are extremely sparse to say the least. When such evaluations do occur, they use qualitative frameworks in determining sustainability outcomes. This has led to the use of reductionist and/or anthropocentric perspectives, such as the Brundtland Commission's definition of sustainable development. This fundamentally contradicts developments in sustainability science, which have strongly advocated the management of the coupled dynamic environment–human relationship at all spatial–temporal scales. Therefore, a quantitative-based evaluation of the EITI's contribution towards sustainable development, using a consistent holistic approach, represents a fundamental knowledge gap within the current literature. In order to address this knowledge gap, this paper conducts such an evaluation by using a new sustainability assessment tool called the Geocybernetic Assessment Matrix (GAM). The GAM applies the fundamental and complex paradigms found within geocybernetic theory through a semi-quantitative matrix approach. The GAM evaluates the 12 principles of the EITI framework in order to determine their contribution towards sustainable development. The results indicate that the EITI is strongly anthropocentric in nature, and does not significantly contribute towards sustainable development of national resource wealth. Furthermore, they indicate that the EITI is flawed in conception and implementation concerning how it contributes towards sustainable development. This is demonstrated by the EITI having no clear statement or commitment as to the need to maintain environmental resources or services for present or future generations. Therefore, there are legimate questions as to the actual value and capabilities of the EITI – both as a tool for the transparent and accountable management of national resource wealth, and as a means of contributing towards sustainable development.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"Effective and sustainable management of mineral resources is one of the key public policy objectives of developing countries. Kyrgyzstan, one of ex-Soviet Central Asian countries, is a perfect example which struggles forming reliable policies as well as a mining industry after shocking political and social movements. In the shadow of several coup d'état attempts, international pressures from regional powers, and ethnic clashes, the government has developed vast administration reforms regulating social and economic changes besides resource management. Policy making in mineral resource management depends upon interim governmental establishments, prior use of the locals, and attributes of the resource. Mineral-rich Kyrgyzstan's initial and current problems' impact on public policies and legislations of resource management provides a case study explaining the emergence of such tools.

"This paper investigated volatility persistence and returns spillovers between oil and gold markets using daily historical data from 1986 to 2015 partitioned into periods before the global crisis and after the crisis. The log-returns, absolute and squared log-returns series of these asset prices were used as proxy variables to investigate volatility persistence using the fractional persistence approach. The Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) modelling framework was applied to investigate the spillover effects between the asset returns. The volatility in the gold market was found to be less than that at the oil market before and after the crisis periods. The returns spillover effect was bidirectional before the crisis period, while it was unidirectional from gold to oil market after the crisis. The fact that there was no returns spillover running from oil to gold after the crisis suggested a measure of optimum allocation weights and hedge ratio. The results obtained are of practical implications for portfolio managers and decision managers in these two ways: gold market should be used as a hedge against oil price inflationary shocks; and the volatility at the oil market can be used to determine the behaviour of gold market.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"In 2009, Greenland received greater autonomy from Denmark and the right to elect government and parliament, the former gaining sovereignty and administration over a number of areas including mineral resources. Since then, the development of mining industry has been forcefully promoted by Greenland's self-government. The political discourse of decision-makers has stressed the importance of sustainability in developing the mining industry, and in particular the social component of sustainability. This article analyses the social sustainability approach of national mining policy and the rapidly evolving governance for mining in Greenland. Findings suggest that Greenland has been proactive in establishing an internationally ambitious governance framework for social sustainability in mining. Mining is perceived to be a contributor to social sustainability through increased economic growth, employment and skills development. Government mining policy and governance framework have not always received the support of local communities and in response the legal framework has been further developed to better promote local participation in mining governance. However, the analysis proposes that despite the discourse around social sustainability, mining policy and governance prioritize economic aspects, giving environmental and social considerations a lower priority.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"This paper examines the asymmetric impact of gold prices, oil prices and their associated volatilities on stock markets of emerging economies. Monthly data are used for the period January 2008 till June 2015. The nonlinear ARDL approach is applied in order to find short-run and long-run asymmetries. The empirical results indicate that gold prices have a positive impact on stock market prices of large emerging BRICS economies and a negative impact on the stock markets of Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, Chile and Indonesia. Oil prices have a negative impact on stock markets of all emerging economies. Gold and oil volatilities have a negative impact on stock markets of all emerging economies in both the short- and the long-run. The results indicate that the stock markets in the emerging economies are more vulnerable to bad news and events that result in uncertain economic conditions.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"This paper empirically explores the relationship between the external factors within the oil and gas (O&G) industry business environment and supply chain sustainability goals to understand the factors that could drive or hinder its adoption of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices. It examines the relationships between six external factors (political stability, economic stability, stakeholder pressure, competition, energy transition and regulations) and sustainability goals through multiple regression analysis, using survey data from companies that operate in the O&G industry. Data analyses reveal that there are two types of sustainability goals namely strategic goals (SGO), which are conditional for long term survival, and functional goals (FGO), which are closely related to the companies' operational processes. The analyses also show that stakeholder pressure and economic stability are the most influential factors that could affect the goals. While competition within the O&G industry has a positive effect on the FGO, competition from the broader energy industry results in a negative effect on the SGO. The influence of energy transition relates to a higher focus on SGO. The results are useful in designing SSCM strategy that could help the O&G industry address the pressure from the external factors for more sustainable supply chain practices to achieve its sustainability goals.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"The continuous rapid increase of steel production and consumption in China since the year 2000 has led to a substantial shift in iron stocks from lithosphere to anthroposphere, making it essential to perform an in-use stock analysis of iron for China. The top-down and bottom-up methods—the most widely used approaches in analyzing in-use metal stocks—are simply introduced. Two other methods, the average use life method and the fixed assets depreciation method, are employed in this study and their results compared. The average use life method is used to analyze Chinese iron in-use stocks and the average age. Some results are obtained: iron in-use stock was 5523.9 million tons in 2013 and average age was relatively high in the period 1993–2000 (about 8.2 years) and dropped after the year 2000. The fixed asset depreciation method is applied to analyze depreciated iron in-use stock and gross domestic product (GDP) generated per unit depreciated iron in-use stock for China. The results demonstrated that the use efficiency of iron in-use stock slowly increased during the period 1993–2002, but has continually decreased since the year 2002. Scenario analysis of future iron in-use stock per capita in China is presented and the corresponding average age and GDP generated per unit depreciated iron in-use stock are calculated.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"The evolution of metal prices shows severe fluctuations and irregular cycles which bring difficulties to accurate forecasting. This paper proposes a novel grey wave forecasting method with unequal-interval contour lines and contour time sequences filtrating to predict metal prices. In the proposed model unequal-interval contour lines are determined by the quantiles of data, which considers the intensity of data. Contour time sequences are filtrated based on autocorrelation characteristics of time series. Furthermore, we use monthly prices of two metals - aluminum and nickel-to assess the performance of our novel grey wave forecasting model with a multi-step-ahead prediction. The empirical analysis indicates the modified grey wave forecasting method is much better than basic grey wave forecasting method in terms of prediction accuracy and it can also achieve better forecasting results than ARMA and random walk.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"China monopolizes the rare earths resource, production, consumption, and export of rare earth products, while it has less opportunity to control the international market price. The issues of over-exploitation, excessive production and environmental pollution in China tend to be serious for a long time. In addition, poor scientific and technological innovation abilities limit the development of domestic rare earth industry. The Chinese government has implemented a series of export restriction policies to solve these problems. Due to the trade tension, the export restriction policies are abolished, and the China's rare earth firms will meet new problems. This study aims to provide an ANP-SWOT approach for interdependent analysis and prioritizing the rare earth industry in China. We analyze the internal and external environment factors, develop five short-term strategies and four long-term strategies to determine the optimal strategy of rare earth industry development plan. The results show that the best short-term development strategies for China's rare earth industry are the protection of key resources, mining right integration, and the best long-term strategies are establishing of national strategic reserve system of rare earth and improving the technical innovation capacity.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"In Canada, indigenous communities have strengthened de jure and de facto rights over the last generation, thereby enabling them to realize substantial resource rents and other economic development income. Canadian First Nations (the preferred name for most indigenous communities) have in recent years established over 200 economic development corporations, many of them hybrid organizations partnering with non-Aboriginal resource corporations. We analyze the challenges of institutional design of such hybrids, employing the concept of fractionalized ownership. We discuss principal-agent problems at two levels: First Nation members relative to their leaders, and leaders relative to managers of economic development corporations. We also analyze principal-to-principal problems that arise with multiple owners. Using a sample of Ontario First Nation communities, the empirical section analyzes the impact of own-source revenue (much of it derived from resource projects) on a socio-economic index. The main conclusion is that incremental own-source revenue improves community socio-economic conditions, but only modestly.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"Based on a theoretical model, Tiltonet al. (2011) concluded that spot and futures prices should be highly correlated during periods of strong contango and much less correlated during periods of weak contango and backwardation. More recently, Gulley and Tilton (2014) found empirical support of this hypothesis for copper data during the period of 1994–2011.In this note, we show that Gulley and Tilton's findings can be rationalized by the theory of storage, as periods of contango and backwardation can be singled out by the sign of the interest-adjusted basis (i. e., storage cost rate minus convenience yield). Our estimation results for the six base metals of the London Metal Exchange show that a stronger association between futures and spot returns during periods of high stocks (i.e., positive interest-adjusted basis) holds only contemporaneously. Indeed, Granger causality, especially from futures to spot returns, may take place regardless of stock levels.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"The East Natuna gas field in Indonesia is planned to be developed to meet the increasing natural gas demand of Indonesia. This research investigates the sustainable development of the field using a multi-criteria decision analysis method (MCDA), namely the preference ranking organisation method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE). For this purpose a PROMETHEE model is employed to compare and appraise four alternative of petroleum funds against technical, economic, environmental and socio-political criteria. Those alternatives are determined by allocating 0%, 10%, 15% and 25% of the government's share of the gas field exploitation as petroleum funds. The results show that the adoption of a petroleum fund for the sustainable field development is both relevant and feasible. The bigger the petroleum fund, the better the merits. Employing 25% of the government's revenue towards this fund is found to be the most preferable choice, since it benefited from technology, environment and social aspects. However, the downside of this alternative lies in the economic aspects, such as the reduction of government revenues and potential increase in government debt as well as government resistance. As this study demonstrates, PROMETHEE can provide a relevant tool to assist decision makers to formulate policies aiming at a sustainable petroleum resources development.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"This paper provides new insights about the factors shaping social acceptance of and opposition to coal mining. It is based on a comparative survey of communities living in two towns with different demographic development and residential quality located in a close proximity to expanding opencast mine in the Czech Republic, which are threatened by displacement due to possible revisions of the current territorial mining limits. We analyze social-spatial differences in perceptions of landscape and place attachment, and the influence of geographical and sociodemographic factors on personal attitudes and the involvement in local anti-coal activities. A strong place attachment that is determined by the quality of living environment and the length of residence proved to be significant predictor of anti-coal attitude, while the employment tied to coal industry and weak place attachments are key factors shaping a pro-coal attitude. A typical active opponent of the coal mining expansion has a higher age, university education and strong place attachment. While both studied communities are characterized by strong active engagement in protest activities, a low level of confidence in the effectiveness of protests to affect decisions of political authorities was also detected.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"Mining cities are of vital importance to the global development, but they are facing great challenges to achieve sustainability goals. Understanding the characteristics and patterns of the environmental, economic, and social conditions of mining cities is critical to promoting their sustainability. After developing an Indicator System for Mining City Sustainability, we collected data from 110 prefecture-level cities and analyzed environmental, economic, and social characteristics of these mining cities using a data-mining method – Association rule mining. Our analysis revealed some novel, implicit, and previously unknown characteristics and patterns of mining city sustainability in China. We found that education investment, economic development, and some aspects of society were substantially unbalanced in most Chinese mining cities. Most coal-mining cites had a larger proportion of mining population, and usually faced severe challenges in reducing industrial dust emission. The unsustainable characteristics of Chinese mining cities exhibited distinctive regional patterns and should be considered explicitly in policy making to promote the sustainability of these urban areas.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"This paper explores the nature of learning linkages through a qualitative and empirically grounded study of three sets of interactions in Brazil's mining industry and finds that: (1) these linkages vary along a spectrum of progressive levels of knowledge intensity, provide a basis for cumulative innovative activities within the mining industry, and are likely to influence innovation in other industries; (2) however, there is local failure for either the government or large corporations to implement proactive policies to support these linkages; (3) nevertheless, an intrinsic motivation among industry stakeholders (including universities) to develop these linkages through relational embeddedness exists, as they react to creative knowledge needs and pressures for cost-reduction or seek to grab opportunities; as such, relational embeddedness appears to offset the absence of policies. However, proactive policies are needed for the expansion and long-term sustainability of these linkages. Policymaking should include government and large mining firms, as well as local suppliers and universities, and build on intrinsic motives and small achievements incrementally. This paper contributes to extending our understanding of the intricacies of learning linkages development in the mining industry. Understanding and illustrating this process is key to strategize policies oriented to industrial development, particularly in resource-rich developing countries.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"In recent decades, platinum-group metals have become increasingly important to the development and diffusion of cleaner technologies being developed to achieve a “low carbon” society. Countries engaged in the development and diffusion of new energy technologies are concerned about steadily importing scarce rare metals. Nevertheless, the question of what kind of competitive relationships exist among demand countries is not well addressed. This study focused on platinum primary product used to produce greener products like next-generation vehicles and analyzed the international trade network complexity of the platinum primary product using the clustering method. From the results, we found that (1) there exit well-separated nine trade clusters (i.e., trade networks with higher exchanges) in the international trade network of 2005, (2) the group including South Africa and the group consisting of Western countries together account for approximately half the total international trade flow in platinum primary products, and (3) international coordination of purchases and sales of platinum among relevant trade partners in the identified largest cluster: South Africa, Russia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Switzerland is crucial in securing the stable supply and demand for platinum.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"The growth of the generation of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE), and the use of hazardous substances in the production of these items, has required legislation to minimise the harm to the environment that their existing use, ultimate disposal and continued growth of the sector may pose. The European Union (EU) started to tackle this problem with the passing of two Directives in 2002, which focused on restricting the use of hazardous substances (RoHS - 2002/95/EC) and organising the recycling or disposal of discarded electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE - 2002/96/EC). These Directives have been recently recast and their scope widened; however, one exception to them remains items specifically designed for defence and military purposes. This paper looks at how and why these European Directives were passed, the impact they have had on defence in the United Kingdom (UK) up to the present moment, what impact the further extension of those directives might have on UK defence policy and how the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) has begun to prepare for any extension, including the use of alternative products from the commercial market, and substituting less harmful materials.

"If fulfilled, the plan to start exploiting iron ore reserves at a large-scale in Uruguay would attract the country’s largest foreign direct investment and would change the productive structure of the country, historically based on agricultural and livestock production. The prospective of large-scale mining could increase public revenue by taxing the activity. However, as the “natural resources’ curse” hypothesis states, there may be some negative effects associated to the exploitation of natural resources: Dutch disease phenomenon, high-income volatility of resources, rent seizing, among others. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact that the exploitation of iron ore reserves might have on the Uruguayan economy, and to discuss different policy options in order to make use of funds derived from the activity. To do so, we apply a dynamic general equilibrium model, and we simulate different revenue allocation policies. Our results show that, even when the exploitation of iron ores reserves might lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency and thus have a negative impact on traditional export sectors, the magnitude of the effect would not be significant, and it would not adversely affect the long-term growth rate. The negative impact can be mitigated with the creation of an intergenerational investment fund, especially when a higher part of it is destined to foreign assets. Destining a high part of the fund to investment in infrastructure also contributes to boost the growth in GDP linked to the introduction of a large-scale mining activity in the country.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"This study analyses the economic developments in Yemen from the 1970s to today in the context of the resource curse hypothesis. After a brief survey of the resource curse literature, using empirical data, historical accounts, and political (economic) analyses, I confirm that post-reunification Yemen suffers from an intense oil curse. The curse is evidenced by low genuine savings rates, oil-dependency, a stagnating economy, and institutional failure. However, this study finds that the institutional failure which caused this is itself a product of the resource-curse-like developments following migrant worker remittances from Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and 1980s. Moreover, the current instability in Yemen has its origins in rent-seeking defections in the corrupt governing patronage network due to sudden anticipations of oil exhaustion. The analysis suggests that worker migration is able to transmit resource curse symptoms to other economies, which makes them also more vulnerable to future resource curse triggers, and that declining resource reserves increase political instability of countries with strong patronage networks.",Volume 49,September 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/49/suppl/C,10
"The planning framework for the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) is undergoing significant change. An integrated plan-led process, similar to that undertaken onshore, is now being applied offshore. It is vital that marine mineral resources are adequately considered in this process. In order to facilitate this, the first ever sand and gravel mineral resources map of the entire UKCS has been created.Offshore resources have been defined by integrating geological mapping data and the British Geological Survey’s extensive collection of core, sea bed sample and geophysical records. A spatial model has been developed that highlights the location and likely composition of sand and gravel deposits with the results undergoing geological review to ensure different sea-bed features have been adequately represented. Results are presented as a series of four maps covering the entire UKCS.With increasing pressure on marine space it is important to balance the competing demands and needs from different use sectors. Identification of the distribution of sand and gravel resources at a national scale and presentation in a consistent fashion allows planners to adequately consider minerals in the planning process and permits more effective and sustainable sea-use management strategies to be developed.",Volume 48,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/48/suppl/C,11
"The paper analyses the process of adapting Polish hard coal mining for steady safe functioning in the conditions of a market economy. The process of structural restructuring of the trade finished between 2006–2007 and had at its first stage (between 1993–2000) a character of crisis management. The situation could be a result of external causes, independent from Polish mining companies, as well as internal causes. In the paper the Authors review selected technical indexes of hard coal production in Poland between 1988–2014. The conducted analyses form a basis to evaluate the ongoing changes in competitiveness of Polish hard coal mining companies on the national and global scale. The Authors show external and internal strategic causes of the current crisis in Polish hard coal mining. They carry out an analysis on a micro and macro scale. In the summary they show that the current crisis in Polish hard coal mining is a resultant of many factors. Despite the fact, however, that coal will be a basic carrier in producing electrical energy in Poland for many years, the demand of Polish economy for Polish hard coal will decrease quickly.",Volume 48,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/48/suppl/C,11
"This paper aims to present a full picture of the current status and future trends of China's iron ore development using system analysis on the iron supply chain. First, we map China's iron flow to present the physical patterns of iron ore supply and demand in China. Next, the historical and future trends of iron ore development in China are discussed from four aspects including demand, resource availability, technology improvement, and strategy and policy. Based on these aspects, we conclude how to sustainably obtain overseas iron ore resources at a reasonable price as the key issue, and this issue is further analyzed from perspectives of market structure, the pricing mechanism, and Chinese steel companies’ behavior. In conclusion, we determined China must enhance cooperation with the main global suppliers, expand overseas investments effectively, and enhance domestic coordination to secure the import of resources and reduce price fluctuations.",Volume 48,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/48/suppl/C,11
"A significant constituent of household wealth in Turkey is gold. Families accumulate gold especially on a variety of cultural occasions such as female-only gold days, circumcision feasts, and engagement and wedding ceremonies. This paper attempts to explain the gold appetite of Turkish households with a rational approach, although still rooted in culture. Many people in Turkey view “earning interest on money” as a transgression of Islamic rules and avoid investing their savings in fixed-income investment instruments. We study the implications of this investor behavior on portfolio gold holdings. Using the Markowitz mean-variance model and monthly return data from 1997 until 2015, we calculate optimal investment portfolios. We find that while the share of portfolio gold holdings is less than a meager 4% if the portfolio includes interest-earning deposits (in addition to the stock index, USD, EURO, and gold), this ratio may go up to more than 50% if interest-earning deposits are not included. Our results show that the role gold plays in an investment portfolio is greatly amplified when interest-earning deposits are not viable. We believe the key factor driving our pronounced findings has been Turkey's historically high rates of inflation. Avoiding fixed-income instruments, many Turkish investors may have turned to gold to shield their savings against inflation and manage portfolio risks caused by its high volatility. Our findings suggest that Turkish policymakers may find it useful to popularize Sukuk (Islam-compliant bonds) if they are to divert household savings away from gold into more productive uses.",Volume 48,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/48/suppl/C,11

It also provides framework for combined internal and industrial risk assessment using fuzzy logic. The fuzzy logic is used to assess the operational risk from two perspectives: internal and industrial. In this context, five mining enterprises from Central and Eastern Europe are examined. Operational risk related to the specifics of the business, due to the geopolitical and progressive globalization of the coal market, is analyzed through mining enterprises that are comparable in value. For individual operational risk diversification in mining enterprises, the assessment of resource potential plays a key role. In terms of the risk associated with the specifics of business, the lowest partial risk assessments relate to customer relationships.",Volume 48,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/48/suppl/C,11
"When encountering high import prices and price volatility, China does not have the power to affect prices, although China has ranked first in iron ore imports since 2003. The existing literature usually investigates the impact factors of iron ore prices using the averaging method. It is difficult to depict the detailed impact of various factors on prices accurately. To provide sounder basis for the Chinese government to enact policy, this paper develops a quantile regression model with the lagged variables to measure factors that affect the import prices of iron ore in China under high, medium and low price levels. The analysis uses monthly data through January 2003 to March 2015. The results indicate that the effect intensity of the factors on the prices are various under different quantiles. As prices rise, the degree of positive influence of previous period of crude steel production on iron ore prices is gradually decreasing; conversely, the strength of previous period of import volume’s negative effect on prices is falling. Furthermore, it verifies that China has no voice in the international iron ore market. In low quantile, the strength of effect of prior period iron ore volume on prices is higher than that of China’s production of iron ore on import prices because the grade of China's iron ore resources is low. Therefore, when the iron ore prices are at a low quantile, China should expand the import of iron ore appropriately and reduce the exploitation of low-grade iron ore resources. Additionally, China should optimize crude steel output and actively invest in overseas iron ore exploration and mining to reduce the effect of prices fluctuations by reducing the dependence on imported iron ore. China may also promote the development of an international iron ore futures market and innovate iron ore business models to hedge foreign exchange risks because of the US dollar index has greatest negative effect on the prices.",Volume 48,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/48/suppl/C,11
"This paper investigates the inflation hedging role of gold price after controlling for the prices of other investment assets. We use annual data on the U.S. economy spanning from 1833 to 2013. We employ a recently developed flexible nonlinear approach that allows for potential ‘interruption’ in the long run equilibrium relationship in which the equilibrium term dynamics is modelled as an AR(1) depending upon an unobserved state process that is a stationary first-order Markov chain in two states, stationarity and non-stationarity. While, a battery of standard cointegration tests without and with breaks could not find evidence to support the inflation hedging role of gold, results from the flexible nonlinear approach indicate the existence of temporary cointegration between gold price and inflation during 1864, 1919, 1932, 1934, 1976, 1980 and 1982.

"The spatial interactions between valuable trees and large-scale mining sector activities provides risks and uncertainties on rural economic livelihood. This generates public clamour and resistance to mineral resource development in developing countries. Hence, this paper analyses the spatial interactions and magnitude of the impacts of large-scale mining industry activities on the Shea as an economic tree. A case study is conducted at the emerging north-west gold province of Ghana. Both primary and secondary data were obtained during two fieldworks. Whereas there is a robust Location Association (La)=70 between a Shea-led manufacturing industry and the wholesale and retail sector, a weak location association is found with mining and quarrying, and the manufacturing sectors. The associated industries are inter-dependent for inputs from the Shea tree, though the spatial analysis reveals that a minimum of 22,460 Shea trees and 806,407 kg of fruits would be displaced. The displacements would affect both manufacturing and wholesale and retail sectors, basically dominated by rural women.

The Chinese rare earth market has an uncontrolled illegal market segment that represents approximately 40% of the domestic market, which translates to 30% of the global market. This sector of the market pays little or no attention to the environmental damage of their mining and processing actions and, through their unregulated supply, depresses the market price such that external (and in some cases, internal) producers are having difficulties making or maintaining profit margins.

"The resource curse literature suggests that many countries have failed to exploit their natural resource wealth to finance the growth of their economies. Developing countries appear to be most affected. It is believed that poor governance, including lack of transparency, poor accountability to citizens and corruption, are the main culprits. In 2002, an international initiative sponsored by the UK government and backed by activist groups launched the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) with a view to mitigating the potential negative effects of resource wealth. The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of this initiative that has gained much traction as a scrutiny mechanism for corruption control. In particular, this paper addresses two key questions: First, what are the observable factors that lead a country to voluntarily join the EITI? Second, does EITI membership leads to greater corruption control? Using the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) control of corruption index, we find that EITI membership has not resulted in reduced corruption scores.",Volume 48,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/48/suppl/C,11
"The form and evolution of stakeholder perceptions toward renewable energy (RE) developments continue to be investigated, but there has been little similar research regarding mines. Responses of community members and other stakeholders cannot be expected to evolve the same way between different resource and infrastructure projects. We ask what the various expectations of planned mines are among community members, and what factors impact these expectations. We perform a case study of a planned, large-scale, mineral sands mine in rural Victoria, Australia (2013–2015). Using a closed-question questionnaire (n=32) and semi-structured interviews (n=25), individual and community experiences of the planning process were examined. We explore stakeholder perceptions of the mining company and development process to date, as well as future expectations. Despite the recognition of mining as a normalised part of modern Australian economy and culture, the results revealed a community with low-trust in the mining company, and accompanying negative perceptions of their own involvement thus far. These perceptions translated into negative future expectations. Many factors influential in the formation of RE opinions were also significant here, these include: background factors; visual and environmental impacts; and, the actions of the company to date. Other factors are not so prevalent in RE literature and may be specific to mines, these include issues surrounding the rehabilitation of the land and the history of the mining company.",Volume 48,June 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/48/suppl/C,11
"In the present work, the effects of energy abundance on sustainable economic growth and the mechanisms of this phenomenon were investigated using panel data from 31 areas (including provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities) in China during the period from 2003 to 2012. The results indicate that the so-called “resource curse thesis” is not supported by the development of China at the provincial level. When several important variables—such as fixed capital, human capital, innovation input, regional openness, and foreign direct investment—are controlled, energy abundance exhibits a significantly positive correlation with economic growth rate. The so-called “Dutch disease”, human capital, and institutional quality are three primary transmission routes through which energy abundance affects economic growth. Among these routes, human capital exhibits the maximum positive transmission effect. Employment in the manufacturing industry can be crowded out by energy abundance, and the institution will be weakened to a certain degree. To promote sustainable economic growth in resource-abundant regions, long-term planning, optimization of industrial structure, and nurturing a good business environment should be supported and developed.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12

"The Pebble gold–copper–molybdenum deposit is a controversial mining project in the headwaters of the Bristol Bay salmon fishery, Alaska. As a member of the Pebble Limited Partnership, the mining company Anglo American sponsored a public engagement exercise to help stakeholders decide whether and how the deposit should be mined. The independent Keystone Policy Center facilitated the dialogue, which positioned science as a means of enhancing public rationality. Stakeholders for and against the mine reviewed the mining partnership's environmental baseline study data but did not reach consensus on whether risks posed to the salmon fishery were too great. Anglo American left the partnership, and the Pebble Dialogue was not completed. The final planned phase of the dialogue involved collaborative community–company mine planning in what would have been a high-impact mechanism of CSR, but negotiations of the risks and benefits to stakeholders did not take place. The mining project has not achieved social license, although the Pebble Dialogue offers some components that should be considered in future public engagement exercises.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"Engagement with the public and stakeholders is an indispensable way to reduce negative effects associated with extractive projects, and is a key dimension in corporate social responsibility (CSR). In response to social protests against extractive projects in Myanmar resulting in project suspensions, Chinese state-backed companies have paid increased attention to CSR and public engagement. This paper will examine one of such cases – the Letpadaung copper mining project invested by Myanmar Wanbao, a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE). Based on semi-structured interviews with villagers at Letpadaung, it will evaluate the extent and nature of public participation, as well as the challenges of implementing CSR in Myanmar’s political context.This paper finds that Myanmar Wanbao actively and visibly tries to salvage its corporate image by establishing a number of public engagement channels and investing in community development projects. While yielding initial results with some villagers expressing support for the project, there is much room for improvement. The company needs to strengthen its engagement with common villagers, not only local elites, and ensure alignment between CSR efforts and villagers’ immediate needs. Influenced by Chinese elite-centred governance principle, ideology of mass participation, and prevailing risk management mind-set, public participation is found to be tokenistic, which does not concede power to the public to contribute to the decision-making of the project. It also explores how CSR and public engagement initiatives of foreign companies are restricted by the local power and governance structures in the host country.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"By-product availability curves were constructed for the production of gallium from bauxite, sulphidic zinc ores and coal. They were used to assess the nature of the current supply regime, as well as its potential future development. Not only was the current situation found to be firmly in the elastic supply regime for all three raw materials, indicating that significant future increases in primary gallium production are possible without increases in the production of the corresponding main products, but it was also found that current supply potential from bauxite and sulphidic zinc ores alone is at least five times higher than current primary production. Coal offers a significant additional supply potential (currently at least ~1.3 times primary gallium production). An extrapolation of growth trends for the primary production of bauxite, zinc and gallium into the future indicates that the minimum supply potential will not be utilised completely before 2050. Once this point is reached, additional increases in primary gallium production relative to the production of bauxite and zinc will still be possible via decreases in the relevant cut-off grades for extraction from these raw materials. No persistent shortages are expected in the foreseeable future. Short-term shortages might, however, occur but will not be due to geological factors. Our results clearly refute the notion that the supply of all by-product high-tech metals is currently restricted by their physical abundance in associated main products. Rather, the chief limitation appears to be installed production capacity.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"Securing stable long-term supplies of raw materials is vital for industrialized nations. China, Japan and South Korea are three countries in East Asia which import large quantities of raw material, especially metals and petroleum products. Unlike the other two, China has large mines and oilfields and so can use this expertise to exploit resources overseas. In contrast Japan and South Korea are resource-poor countries that lack domestic petroleum and mining industries.This paper compares the ways in which these two countries secure supplies. Japanese trading companies and industrial groups invest in mining and petroleum projects run by international groups with the active support from the Japanese government through the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). In contrast, the Korean government has set up two state run corporations: the Korea Resource Corporation, KORES, for minerals, and the Korean National Oil Corporation KNOC for oil and LNG, which usually take a leading role in choosing projects, though they do work in partnership with large Korean private sector groups. After his election in 2008, President Lee Myung-bak put pressure on public sector entities to speed up investments in mining and petroleum projects, which resulted in unsuitable projects being financed and public money being wasted. We argue that three lessons can be learned from this: firstly, building up a solid basis of natural resources takes decades and should not be rushed; secondly, project finance in the sense of non-recourse funding provides better checks and balances than direct acquisitions do and thirdly more transparency is required when spending taxpayers' money.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"Social sustainability, one of the three pillars of the sustainable development framework, presents a challenging theoretical and empirical concept to investigate. Many of the prominent debates on sustainable development focus on the challenge of managing economic and environmental issues, leaving the social side of the equation less well-defined. The article expands on the concept of social sustainability through a qualitative study of mining projects in the European North and Northwest Russia, utilizing over 80 thematic interviews in local communities.In our approach social sustainability is understood two dimensional: procedural and contextual. Procedural social sustainability refers to the planning and decision-making of the mining process during mining operations. Contextual social sustainability covers the specific features of the locality including historical experiences of extractive industries and future visions of the community. From the procedural perspective there were two general themes important for the local communities: knowledge and understanding of environmental changes caused by mining and second, the ability to be heard and have an impact on decisions about mining operation. From contextual dimension of social sustainability the main dilemma in Northern communities is between the fear and even anxiety of negative environmental impacts and viability of Northern localities generated by mining providing e.g. employment opportunities, prosperity and better service-structure.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"Prices of by-product metals and minerals are often assumed to be inherently more volatile than prices of main and individual products. Yet there is limited analysis of their relative price volatilities. This paper applies regression analysis to compare the price volatility of by-product metals and minerals to commodities produced primarily or solely as main-products or individual products. This approach allows for estimating whether by-product supply is associated with greater price volatility and provides a framework for further research. By-products are found to have on average about 50% higher price volatility than main and individual products when evaluating annual prices over the last 50 years – although there are exceptions. However, when analyzing monthly prices over the past decade, the evidence that by-products have greater price volatility is mixed.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"Governments have, for a long time, invested in the direct provision of basic geological survey information to support exploration and mining activity. Recently, Australian governments have also started to provide direct drilling subsidies to exploration companies. Using data for Western Australia we investigate the return to government from the direct provision of geological survey information and the provision of drilling subsides. We find no evidence that drilling subsidies are less effective than traditional geological survey spending in generating a return to government. We suggest drilling subsidies are effective because there is a dishonesty externality in the market for exploration equity capital that gives rise to a market for lemons problem, and that government programs to award drilling subsidies to exploration companies work as a third party certification system that addresses this problem. We conclude by showing that, with real discount rates of 5%, 7%, and 9%, and a narrow definition of benefits, the expected benefit–cost ratios for State government support for exploration are 9.0, 6.7, and 5.2.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"In the extraction of metal from a mine, the intermediate ore between the economic and the breakeven cutoff grade is usually stockpiled for future processing once the mine is depleted. This research establishes a theoretical two-stage economic model to derive the value of this stockpile and how it affects optimal mining rate. By deriving the optimal condition for objective profit function and parameterized analysis, this research finds the stockpiling option can significantly boost a mine's profit. Processing the stockpiled material affects the optimal mining rate and cutoff grade strategy significantly compared to the case that it is not processed. The research also investigates the optimal mining rate's sensitivity to input variables such as commodity price, discounting rate, capital cost, and processing capacity, etc. In addition, the intrinsic advantages of this approach compared to the broadly used Lane's model (1988) are discussed.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"We use a boosting approach to study the time-varying out-of-sample informational content of various financial and macroeconomic variables for forecasting the volatility of gold-price fluctuations. We use an out-of-sample R2 statistic to evaluate forecasts as a function of the shape of a forecaster's loss function. We show that, when compared to an autoregressive benchmark forecast, those forecasters tend to benefit from using predictions implied by the boosting approach who encounter a larger loss when underestimating rather than overestimating the future volatility of gold-price fluctuations. We use a simulation experiment to study the significance of this benefit.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"From four dimensions of economy, society, potential and environment, we select seven indicators including economy scale, contribution to GDP and employment, guarantee period, the discharge of industrial waste water, sulfur dioxide and smoke dust to build the evaluation index system of Mineral Resources Carrying Capacity (MRCC). Then index system evaluation method is used to evaluate the diversity of MRCC in Chinese mining cities selected from the National resources city sustainable development planning (2013–2020). The final result shows that: ① MRCC is stronger in the central, western mining cities and growing mining cities which have great potential for mining industry.② Mature and growing mining cities exhibit stable or good mining economy, which have higher contribution to GDP and employment; with good economic transformation, regenerating mining cities have higher economy scale and longer guarantee period; the environmental pollution is much more serious in growing mining cities.③ The coordination between mineral resources exploitation and environment need to be improved urgently in many mining cities, especially the western and the growing ones. Thus this paper suggests focusing on improving the contribution to GDP in growing and regenerating mining cities, ameliorating the reemployment in the central, western and recession mining cities, extending the guarantee period of mineral resources in declining mining cities, coordinating mineral resources exploitaion and environment in western and growing mining cities.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"Steel scrap is an important raw material in the steel making industry. As steel is a vital metal in modern life, the price of steel scrap is viewed as an important indicator of the macroeconomic activity. Steel scrap is consumed mainly in the electric arc furnace steel making, which represents approximately 30 per cent of the world annual steel production. Unlike other minerals including iron ore, both the supply and consumption amounts of steel scrap can be relatively easily adjusted based on the contemporary industrial activity level. For this reason, the steel scrap price reflects the condition of the macro economy and thereby it can be used as an indicator of future stock market performance in the country by market participants. Nevertheless, there is not much research on the market of steel scrap. This study aims to close this gap by testing the lead–lag relationship between the changes of steel scrap price and the aggregate Japanese stock market movement. Our empirical analyses suggest that the steel scrap price changes are informative in explaining the future stock market performance in Japan.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"The research perspective of gold is either as a commodity or as a financial asset in most previous research. This paper initially examines the double nature of the price of gold both as a commodity and money from 1969 to 2014 by a statistics model, namely the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). We decompose and categorize the gold price by time frequency into three different series: high frequency series, low frequency series and trend series, which takes 4.17%, 25.68%, 70.15% of the total variability, respectively. The high frequency series is consistent with the reaction of gold price to the influence of speculation and economic events, while the low frequency series is changing simultaneously with gold's varying role in world currency and as a safe haven asset. The trend series of gold grows steadily because of scarcity and increasing volume of jewelry purchases. Therefore, we interpret the high frequency series and trend series as a reflection of gold's commodity property, and the low frequency series is associated with gold's monetary property. This technology of EEMD sheds light on the double nature and price change of gold in the past.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12

"This paper presents a first approach towards the development of a dynamics decision-making tool (DDMT) for open pit mine planning projects. In this paper, a decision framework, the so-called real option decision framework (RODF), is developed based on a real-options approach with practical applicability to a mining investment project. Four strategic operating options namely, deferral options, maintain options, expand options, and shutdown options, are assumed for mining operations. We illustrated the proposed framework and developed methods for a hypothetical gold mine. The standard discounted cash flow (DCF) method was carried out to analyze the project values without options. The real option valuation (ROV) approach was calculated for the deferral and expand options. We used a system dynamics (SD) modeling method to solve real options problems and the discrete-event simulations were used to simulate the potential values of the projects. The findings are that investors are prone to lose an opportunity to invest if relying on traditional DCF-NPV rules as they suggest accepting the project if and only if NPV is greater than zero. However, results obtained from real options suggest that the project has a value to an investor across different time horizons. The insight is that it is of paramount importance to find an optimal time to exercise a strategic option. It is indicated that strategic options such as the deferral option may yield a higher value than the base case (DCF-NPV) mine option because project risks can be hedged, whereas the expand option may also offer additional value to mine operators. However, such extra-additional values can only be captured through managerial flexibility.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"The purpose of the paper was to assess the main historical drivers of potash demand, to generate estimates of demand elasticities and to produce forecasts of potash consumption during the coming decade. The paper has used a comprehensive econometric model to estimate shortrun and long run price, income and cross elasticities. The world potash demand is found to be price inelastic in the short-run and even in the long run. Also, income, cross price elasticity and cross yield elasticity were found to be inelastic in the short and long run. Our modeling predicts that potash consumption for fertilizers will increase from 28.2 million tonnes in 2012 to around 37.8 million tonnes in 2022, which implies that the annual relative growth rate of potash consumption is expected to increase by 2.9%. As long as demand increases our prediction is that real potash prices will also increase, ceteris paribus. Delays in commissioning new production capacity are likely the main reason for price increases. Yet additional planned capacities that could potentially take place in the next decade still have the potential to limit the upside for potash prices.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"Why has Zimbabwe, a state that has been notorious for an utter disregard of international agreements, spent resources to implement policies that are in compliance with the Kimberley Process diamond certification scheme? In this research I explain variation in Zimbabwean regulatory policy in response to the Kimberley Process since 2003. This article contends that this variation can be best understood by tracing the political economy of factional rivalries within the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party. This research demonstrates that although the behavior of international regimes and private economic actors matter, in Zimbabwe it is government factions within ZANU-PF that are the main decision makers in relation to Kimberley Process regulations. This explains both why compliance with the Kimberley Process has been lower than other states in Southern Africa and why Zimbabwe has raised its level of compliance with the regulatory regime overtime.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12
"Resource extractive companies are providing an increasing amount of information about their corporate social responsibility (CSR) interventions, which often include diverse health initiatives provided to mine workers, mine workers׳ families and neighboring communities. This paper undertakes a review of the health initiatives of Colombia׳s leading mining, oil and gas companies, reported between 2005 and 2012. These interventions aim to improve the life of individuals both at work and in neighboring communities (including artisanal miners). Outcomes of this study were that companies preferred to use interventions that prevent disease rather than diagnose or treat it. Sixty percent of interventions targeted the health of mine workers, another 14% of interventions were directed to improve the health of the families of mine workers and the remaining 25% addressed the health needs of the wider community. Non-communicable diseases now account for more deaths than communicable diseases in Colombia, and perhaps in response to this we found that most interventions were associated with the control of non-communicable diseases (75%). Companies were more likely to address the health needs of indigenous peoples, if large populations of indigenous people lived near to their sites.All of the Colombian districts with resource extraction activity had evidence of considerable levels of poverty and studied resource companies were attempting to alleviate health-related needs to some degree, above the provision of royalties to central or regional government. Artisanal mining plays an important role in the Colombian economy, and these miners are exposed to a multitude of health and safety risks. One larger scale gold mining company reported interventions that target improving conditions of artisanal miners. This study highlights the importance of all stakeholders in the economy (including MOG companies, local district governments, NGOs, etc.) actively participating in developing and implementing health interventions to improve the human development of communities impacted by resource extraction activities in Colombia.",Volume 47,March 2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/47/suppl/C,12

We apply this methodology to two 20-asset mining (gold and iron ore-nickel) sector portfolios from the Australian Securities Exchange. The pair vine copulas prove to be powerful tools for the modeling of changing dependence risk under three different period scenarios combined with the optimization of portfolios that have complex patterns of dependence. The portfolio optimization results converge, on average, in some stocks.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"The construction of a vertical-management system of coal mine safety supervision since 2000 is an important measure to improve coal mine safety in China. This paper examines its effect on coal mine production safety by combining the structural break test, by which the establishment of the supervision system is divided into two phases (2000–2009 and 2010–2013), with an unbiased grey Markov model. This paper then proposes a staged evaluation framework through considering the respective characteristics of sample data and model applicability. The results show that the models are suitable for forecasting the death rate per million tons (DRPMT) of coal due to their desirable characteristics. Coal mine safety has significantly improved since 2000 with the constant decline of DRPMT due to the gradual construction of supervision institutions, which produced increasingly positive institutional effect (2.3373 persons/million tons) in the first phase. However, the benefit from institution construction was close to zero (0.0667 persons per million tons per year) in the second phase due to a supervision-institution construction standstill. By analyzing the current problems, this paper suggests continuing to improve the current supervision system for coal mine safety through further adjusting respective functions of ""State Supervision"" and local regulation departments; namely, reducing the regulation functions in the ""State Supervision"", improving its supervising ability for local regulation departments and playing a leading role in coal mine accident investigation.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"This paper provides an historical analysis of how the growth of Japan's post-World War Two iron ore demand led to the development of the Asian iron ore market. The paper analyses bilateral advantages that geographic closeness provided to Japanese and Australian iron ore traders, and calculates how the bilateral quasi-profits arising from geographic closeness were divided between them.The model estimates that Australia's freight advantage to Japan was worth on average around US$124.8 million per year between 1985 and 2003—over that period iron ore trade between Australia and Japan was worth on average US$909.9 million per year. The freight sharing agreement between Australia and Japan provided US$32.3 million per year of the transport cost differential to Australian exporters, while Japanese importers received the remaining US$92.5 million.Despite the long-run nature of the Australia–Japan bilateral advantage, the development of the Asian iron ore market was influenced by strategic government interventions which aimed to capture shortrun rents. The short-run interventions by the Australian government threatened Japan's market access security and catalysed the development of Brazilian iron ore export capacity, which remains as Australia's largest competitor in the Asian market.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"In this context, this paper analyses the scenario in which China abolishes export restrictions and the resulting effects on firms at home and abroad by building a static game-theoretic model. We also establish a dynamic game-theoretic model with complete information to simulate another scenario that China enhances resource tax and levies an environmental tax and to evaluate its effects on firms in China and abroad in different tax rates. The results show that when abolishing rare earths export restrictions, China's rare earths production and export will increase; while rare earths production, domestic supply and price in foreign country will decrease. Moreover, if the Chinese government enhances resource taxes and levies an environmental tax, the production, domestic supply, and exports of rare earths will decrease in China, whereas the opposite effects will exist in other countries. Furthermore, a reasonable rate for the resource and environmental tax should be identified because it is the key factor affecting the market supply in China and abroad. Finally, several policy implications for the Chinese and other governments are proposed.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"The demand for some of the rarer elements in the Earth's crust, mostly from high-tech applications, is increasing rapidly. Many of these elements are produced exclusively as by-products resulting in potentially significant supply limitations. In this article, a general method for the assessment of the supply potential of such elements is developed from a conceptual model of the supply-chain. Namely, statistical and deterministic models are introduced to quantify both the variability in by-product concentrations in the relevant raw materials, as well as the effects of this variability on achievable recoveries. The assessment of uncertainties is implemented via Monte-Carlo-type simulations. Presentation of the results in availability curves ensures adaptability to future changes in market conditions, while extensive documentation of the assessment method, available as electronic supplementary material with this article, ensures reproducibility.A simple example is used to illustrate the complete estimation process. It shows that in addition to ensuring future adaptability of the results, availability curves are also useful for the assessment of the current supply regime of a given by-product. An elastic and inelastic regime might be distinguished – in the elastic regime, significant demand-driven increases in by-product supply are possible without increases in the production of the main product, while in the inelastic regime this is not the case. The method presented in this article is the first to enable such an assessment to be made in a reliable and transparent manner.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"The introduction of molybdenum and cobalt, two minor metals, in the London Metal Exchange provides us with the opportunity to assess the effect of futures markets on price behavior. Simple tests show that metal markets without futures are more volatile that metal markets with futures, although we cannot say whether or not this difference stems from the presence of futures markets or from distinct market fundamentals. This paper also demonstrates via the Vector Error Correction Model and causality tests, a cointegration relationship between molybdenum price and nickel price due to similar sectorial outlets. The introduction of futures markets for molybdenum seems to have reinforced this relationship. The double trading price system (market prices and reported prices) characterizing cobalt and molybdenum markets appears to be dominated by LME market prices. This assumption is supported by the weak exogeneity of market prices in VECM, different causality tests, and Cholesky impulse responses. On the contrary, the price discovery mechanism of future prices seems not to work, most likely because of the lack of liquidity on these markets. A strong and permanent increase in transaction volumes on minor metal futures markets is necessary in order to ensure the continuity of their existence.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"Green Mine has become a common plan of Green Mining in China since 2003. Phosphate mining is noticeably important for agriculture. Despite mining technologies made a great progress, resources depletion and mining produced environmental problems are still very severe in many developing countries. Green Mine construction can be a feasible choice to arouse the enthusiasm of Corporation Social Responsibility (CSR) and widely facilitate the Green Mining. Thus, the pith of Green Mine is introduced, which is a critical part of recourses policy for Green Mining. Focusing on demonstration projects, field research and questionnaires are carried out to pick up experts' opinions all over the typical phosphate mining areas. Then as an unprecedented trial, evaluation index system for Green Mine (phosphate) is presented. And it profoundly fosters the basic Green Mine connotation by measuring mining efficiency, Research and Development (R&D), Cleaner Production, corporation management, environment quality and social benefits performance. The proposed evaluation model is characterized by a combination method of Delphi, AHP and Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. On this basis, special evaluation case studies are subsequently available and findings reflect a common performance of both open-pit and underground mines. However, Green Mine policy is a difficult choice for the Chinese government and mining industry. And a stronger need for interdisciplinary cooperation is necessary to bring the Green Mine a bright future. Further research may be the application of other hybrid approaches with the fuzzy analysis of the Green Mine.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13

In order to check for the impact of real oil price on the real gold, return on real oil and return on real gold are used. The study employed types of GARCH models which suggested that an increase in real oil price has positive effects on gold. The EGARCH model provides the evidence that a 10% increase in the oil price returns leads to 4.7% increase of gold and shocks to gold price have an asymmetric effect, which means positive and negative shocks have different effect on gold price in terms of magnitude.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"There is hitherto limited scholarship on the risks of corruption in local content policies in the extractive sector throughout the world. Yet, the concern that corruption might rear its head in local content policies in the extractive sector, particularly in developing countries where regulatory mechanisms are weak, has been raised. This paper seeks to contribute to the scholarship by examining the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act (2010) with a view to identifying the points of corruption vulnerability in the Act. The paper argues that the Act contains four points of corruption vulnerability related to the following: conflict of interest, broad discretionary power and the likelihood of political influence as well as influence by oil and gas companies, the murkiness of the oil and gas contract system in Nigeria, and the potential of the Act to serve as an engine of facilitation payments.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"This paper examines the problem of Dutch disease in Russia during the oil boom of the 2000s, from both the theoretical and empirical points of view. Our analysis is based on the classical model of Dutch disease by Corden and Neary (1982). We examine the relationship between changes in the real effective exchange rate of the ruble and the evolution of the Russian economic structure during the period 2002–2013.We empirically test the main effects of Dutch disease, controlling for the specific features of the Russian economy, namely the large role of state-owned organizations. We estimate the resource movement and spending effects as determined by the theoretical model and find the presence of several signs of Dutch disease: the negative impact of the real effective exchange rate on the growth in the manufacturing sector, the growth of the total income of workers, and the positive link between the real effective exchange rate and returns on capital in all three sectors. However, the shift of labor from manufacturing to services cannot be explained by the appreciation of the ruble alone.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"There had been a mining boom in Finland before the current recession. The most ambitious investment was the Talvivaara nickel and zinc mine in Kainuu. The operation phase began in 2008, and for three years the mine produced nickel and zinc according to expectations. Then everything changed: two accidents occurred in 2012, which had severe environmental consequences. There was a failed attempt at corporate restructuring. The production company of Talvivaara is now in bankruptcy, and the national government is financing the mine. Our aim is to present an evaluation of the impact these events had on the employment and population of Kainuu region. Our results for the period 2009–2014 indicate that the Talvivaara mine still had a positive cumulative effect on the employment of Kainuu, in spite of the environmental accidents. The results for the period 2015–2022 suggest that the full implementation of the rejected corporate restructuring plan would have been a tolerable solution for the employment and population of Kainuu region.

"This study investigates the price volatility of metals, using GARCH and GJR models. First, we examine the persistence of volatility and the leverage effect across metal markets taking into account the presence of outliers. Second, we estimate the effects of oil price shocks on the price volatility of metals, allowing for asymmetric responses. We use daily spot prices for aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin, zinc, gold, silver, palladium and platinum. We find that returns have a high degree of volatility persistence before and after correcting for outliers, outliers bias the estimation of GARCH and GJR models, and removing outliers improves volatility modelling. However, Student-t-based specifications outperform outliers correction in capturing volatility. Moreover, we document inverse leverage effects for seven metals, leverage effect for copper and no leverage effects for nickel and palladium. Finally, price volatility of metals reacts differently and asymmetrically to oil price shocks.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"There exists a widespread assumption that many of the belligerent parties in eastern DRC finance part of their war efforts through the sale of mineral ores originating from the areas under their control. As a result, recent years have witnessed the launch of various national and international initiatives to make the Congolese artisanal mining sector more transparent and to prevent so-called 'conflict minerals' from entering the legitimate international market. A strikingly paradoxical feature of these initiatives is that, in terms of the level of implementation, the conflict-ridden Kivu provinces are lagging far behind the relatively stable province of Katanga. This paper argues that the concentration of conflict mineral policy implementation in Katanga can, to a very large extent, be attributed to the role of the 'Katanga policy network', a group of highly influential public and private actors closely working together towards the reform of the province's artisanal and small-scale mining sector. In line with the dialectical approach to policy networks advocated by Marsh and Smith, the paper examines three types of interactive relationships: between the structure of the Katangese policy network and the agents operating within them; between the Katangese policy network and the context in which it operates; and between the Katangese policy network and the policy outcome.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"The present paper explores the relationship between physical and economic depletion of a nonrenewable natural resource using a decomposition of mining costs akin to the one used in the literature on productivity and technical change. We argue that this decomposition can provide key insights on future availability of nonrenewable natural resources. Using data on slate mining in Galicia (Northern Spain), we provide quantitative evidence of the role played by physical depletion in economic exhaustion but also of the offsetting effects of technical change. Additionally, we provide a measure of the effects on economic depletion of input prices, output, fixed inputs and production scale. Input prices and fixed input misallocation contributes far more to economic depletion than physical depletion while technical change has a remarkable negative contribution to economic depletion. Policy implications are discussed, particularly, the importance of promoting technical change.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"In practice, volatility forecasting under model uncertainty is an important issue. In this paper, the main purpose is to apply the model averaging techniques to reduce volatility model uncertainty and improve volatility forecasting. for the copper futures. Then, various loss functions are employed to assess the forecasting performance. The empirical study results show that the model averaging methods can significantly reduce the uncertainty of forecast. Furthermore, the OLS time-varying weighted model averaging method can achieve the smallest forecasting error and significantly reduce the over-prediction percentage.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"This paper studies investments in new tungsten mining projects, analyzing in-depth five ready-to-go projects around the world that were presented to the financial markets by listed companies to obtain funds so that they could start operations in the near future: the Barruecopardo open-cut project in Spain (Ormonde Mining); Kilba open-cut project in Australia (Tungsten Mining); Hemerdon open-cut project in the United Kingdom (Wolf Minerals); Sangdong underground project in South Korea (Woulfe Mining); and King Island Scheelite, a mixed open-cut and underground project in Tasmania (King Island Scheelite). These investment projects were selected on the basis of having completed a Definitive Feasibility Study on October 2014 (Barruecopardo, Hemerdon, Sangdong and King Island Scheelite) according to Bloomberg. In addition, an Australian project was added within the study (Kilba) due to the high number of Australian mining companies that are developing tungsten mining projects around the world.The conclusions of this research clearly define the future direction in which mining reporting standards should develop in relation to feasibility analysis and provide a strong tool to address the initial steps for analyzing future investments in tungsten mining projects by estimating the initial investment and processing plant costs and operating costs based on the planned mining and processing parameters.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"Using Australian firm data, this study constructs an error correction model of capital stock adjustment to examine the uncertainty–investment relationship in the mining industry. As indicated, with firm features, the effect of demand uncertainty on the short run investment response to demand shocks is positive, while the effect of demand uncertainty on investment is negative. In addition, changes in exchange rate costs and Chinese ownership promote investment. More specifically, separating the sample period into before and after 2003, the estimation suggests that only after 2003 with the negative effect of Chinese GDP growth uncertainty, Chinese ownership had a positive effect on Australian mining investment. This suggests that rising Chinese demand after 2003 has a large impact on Australian mining investment.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"This work aims to analyze the cointegration and causality relationship among oil and precious metals of gold, silver and copper by using nonlinear ARDL and two popular nonlinear causality tests; Hiemstra and Jones (1994), and Kyrtsou and Labys (2006) test for the period from 1973:1 through 2012:11 monthly. According to the asymmetric Kyrtsou and Labys test (2006) results, an interesting finding emerges; precious metal prices returns respond nonlinearly to shocks to changes in crude oil prices only at earlier lags. Symmetric case results imply that there is evidence for bidirectional causality between pairs of oil and gold price and oil and silver price. Moreover a unidirectional relationship emerge for oil and copper prices for the asymmetric positive case and no causality for other cases. According to Hiemstra and Jones causality test, bi-directional causality between gold and oil and copper and oil and a unidirectional Granger causality running from oil price to silver price have emerged. In this way, asymmetric Kyrtsou and Labys (2006) results and Hiemstra and Jones (1994) results are different. Although the tests do not provide consistent results for the considered commodities, it can be concluded that, our models grasped the nonlinear nature in the price discovery process, hence partially captured the nonlinearity between oil and gold markets and their important role in macroeconomy.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"The management of operating costs is essential to the efficiency and economic sustainability of mining operations and nevertheless, most cost management systems in the minerals industry are designed only and exclusively to meet financial accounting and reporting needs and lack of focus on decision taking and continuous improvement. This paper describes the result of a research program aiming to develop an innovative cost management methodology that applies Activity-Based Costing (ABC) and PDCA's Deming cycle tools to develop a cost management system for continuous improvement of operational efficiency and cost reduction. The implementation of this methodology in a mining operation would imply a breakthrough in the corporate approach to operations managements, from the conventional top-down approach to budgeting and control to a bottom-up integration of cost management and accountability. In this regard, the methodology was tested in the Andina underground mine III Panel sector of Corporation del Cobre (CODELCO), in Chile.

"In 2014, Myanmar (Burma) confounded industry analysts by emerging to become the World's third biggest tin producer, experiencing a 5-year tin production increase of ca. 4900%. This surprise emergence of Myanmar as a major tin producer is a possible Black Swan event that potentially has significant repercussions both for the future of global tin production, and for the economic development of Myanmar. This is a disruptive event that has likely contributed to a substantial drop in tin prices in 2015. The Myanmar production increase came from a new mine site in Wa State, and not from the traditional tin-producing areas in the South. We discuss tin mining and potential in Myanmar and consider whether it could provide a foundation for the economic rehabilitation of the country.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"Big Data and predictive analytics have received significant attention from the media and academic literature throughout the past few years, and it is likely that these emerging technologies will materially impact the mining sector. This short communication argues, however, that these technological forces will probably unfold differently in the mining industry than they have in many other sectors because of significant differences in the marginal cost of data capture and storage. To this end, we offer a brief overview of what Big Data and predictive analytics are, and explain how they are bringing about changes in a broad range of sectors. We discuss the “N=all” approach to data collection being promoted by many consultants and technology vendors in the marketplace but, by considering the economic and technical realities of data acquisition and storage, we then explain why a “n « all” data collection strategy probably makes more sense for the mining sector. Finally, towards shaping the industry’s policies with regards to technology-related investments in this area, we conclude by putting forward a conceptual model for leveraging Big Data tools and analytical techniques that is a more appropriate fit for the mining sector.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"Governments that lack the capacity to mine resources themselves have to attract foreign direct investment. However, since resources are not renewable, countries need to capture a ‘fair’ share of mineral resource rent to promote their development. While the sharp rise of the world prices of most minerals multiplied the total natural resources rents by 2.3 between 2002 and 2008 (World Bank, 2015), tax revenue earned by African governments from the non-renewable natural resource sector only grew by a factor of 1.5 (Mansour, 2014).The sharing of mineral resource rent between governments and investors is often criticised for being unfavourable to African governments. But what do we really know about the sharing of mineral resource rent in Africa? The aim of this study is to review theoretical and empirical studies on rent sharing in Africa and to note their limitations regarding knowledge of the actual sharing of mineral rent.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"This paper examines the impact of electoral cycles and the introduction of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) policy upon the holding of small-scale mining property rights in Guyana. Mining is both the major cause of deforestation and the main economic activity in the country. A simple model of the incentives to hold mining property rights is developed and tested using a unique data-set of small-scale mining property rights data. Econometric techniques are used to test the findings of the model, concluding that the number of mining rights issued fall after election years, with the number rescinded rising. The introduction of REDD+ in Guyana also seems to have increased the number of mining claims being relinquished, and reduce the number being issued. The findings highlight the importance of political economy events in the evolution of small-scale mining activity, and show some evidence that the introduction of a REDD+ framework in Guyana has impacted the main driver of deforestation, despite the absence of specific policy targeting the sector.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"Export restrictions on metals and mineral products have been broadly applied by many countries with a view to securing domestic supply and addressing resource depletion. Export restrictions are designed to meet diverse policy objectives ranging from environmental protection and increasing fiscal revenue to the development of processing sectors. The global dependency on China for raw materials (particularly rare earth elements) is a contentious issue, as China imposes a number of restrictions on the export of these minerals. This study uses the case of rare earth elements to evaluate Chinese export restrictions, reviewing China's current monopoly over the industry and providing insights on how widely traded these minerals are and China's position in international trade in terms of both volume and value. The study investigates the various trade restrictions imposed by China and their implications, including the availability of materials to industrialized countries.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"In this paper, a clear and structured economic model is introduced to illustrate complex past and future developments of the market for rare earth elements (REE). The model consists of a sequence of four supply and demand models that give explanations how the mining and separation step of the REE value chain could concentrate in China. Furthermore, the sequence allows giving a coherent scenario for the future developments of the REE market. According to this scenario, the market could transform into an at least oligopoly due to a growing market demand. The validity of this scenario is discussed and evaluated from the perspective of western countries, investors and China. Additionally, a scenario, based on the models, of a propagating monopoly along the value chain is discussed. Finally, suggestions are made for western governments to promote the transformation and lead it to a positive outcome.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"Commodities markets due to their unique characteristics that are they exhibit negative correlation with returns of traditional asset classes and are among the few assets that offer protection from the effects of inflation have recently garnered investors’ attention especially through the development of commodity index financial products. This financialization process that started in the early 2000s and escalated after 2004 has precipitated price comovements among various types of commodities creating a proper setting for the examination of herding behavior. Employing a comprehensive dataset of investable commodities indices we examine the existence of herding behavior via static and time varying models. Our findings reveal no evidence of herding behavior according to static model. However, when rolling window analysis is in place significant anti-herding behavior is detected. These behavioral patterns are corroborated through a time varying stochastic volatility model. Our results contain significant implications for investors, commodities producers and policy makers.","Volume 46, Part 2",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P2,13
"The economic and social outcomes of mining development can be enhanced by positioning local communities central to development activities. Conventional approaches have failed to respond to the needs of the community without this involvement in decision making. Accordingly, novel development approaches for community involvement and sustainability have to recognize the complex nature of social systems in which mining sector exists. The objective of this paper is to develop a community-centered approach by integrating rapid and participatory nature of design thinking with multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in order to support sustainable development. While design thinking engages multiple stakeholders for generating alternatives, MCDA provides metrics for assessing these alternatives. Drawing on an example from a small scale mining development in Central America, this paper shows that early community involvement and rigorous impact assessment on a regular basis motivate community involvement and give value to the social outcome of mining development.","Volume 46, Part 1, Pages 1-142 (December 2015)",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P1,14
"Although mining companies contribute positively to the social and economical components of sustainable development (SD) by generating employment and wealth, they still negatively contribute to the ecological component of SD. Therefore, mining companies are increasingly showing their inclination toward the adoption of green supply chain management (GSCM) in order to improve their ecological performance. With an extensive literature survey, various criteria and sub-criteria for improving the effectiveness of GSCM implementation are identified from the literature. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to evaluate the competitive priorities of these criteria, and interested organizations can use it as a procedural guidance for GSCM implementation. It has been found that mining companies have not given the “soft” factors of GSCM adequate attention. This study explores how the “appropriate implementation approach” and “continuous improvement” are the weaker areas of GSCM practice in the case of the Indian mining sector. Hence, mining industries need to focus on these weaker areas and bring necessary improvements to these areas in order to enhance their GSCM performance.","Volume 46, Part 1, Pages 1-142 (December 2015)",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P1,14
"Mass consumption and shortening product lifecycles have increased worldwide production. Consequently, more raw materials such as minerals are used, and available landfills are filling up. Companies are urged to effectively incorporate sustainability issues such as End-of-life (EOL) management and Reverse Logistics (RL) practices to close the loop and diminish the amount of raw materials used in their production systems. However, implementing RL implies dealing with its barriers. The purpose of this article is to focus on the recovery of EOL products that use mostly raw materials from the mining and minerals industry by identifying and analyzing the interactions among the barriers that hinder RL development in Brazil. First, international peer-reviewed publications were considered to select the barriers and classify them into categories. In a second moment, an empirical research was conducted using the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) tool named Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to evaluate the relationship between the barrier categories. Logistics experts from machinery manufacturing industry sector in Brazil were consulted. The greater influence on all barrier categories is Policy related issues barrier category, which means that the lack of specific laws and lack of motivational legislation are still significant impediments to RL implementation in Brazil.","Volume 46, Part 1, Pages 1-142 (December 2015)",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P1,14
"Increasing environment related problems and societal issues generally emerged due to different activities of the supply chain that pushes the industries to move towards social responsible Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) practices. To deal with this, an attempt has been made here to identify, analyze and model the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) to implement GSCM towards sustainability in industries in Indian perspective. Twenty six CSFs to implement GSCM towards sustainability are recognized by means of the literature review and in discussions with experts. A solution methodology based on the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) technique is used to propose a structural model, which not only helps in understanding the contextual relationship among these CSFs, but also in determining their interdependence to implement GSCM towards sustainability. Further, the importance of CSFs has been determined based on their driving and dependence power by using MICMAC analysis. “Scarcity of Natural Resources” has been identified as most important CSF that may force industries to implement GSCM practices to ensure their business sustainability. A case example of Indian mining industry is presented to show the real-world applicability of the proposed model. This work may help practitioners, regulators and academicians to focus their efforts towards implementation of sustainable GSCM on various levels in business.","Volume 46, Part 1, Pages 1-142 (December 2015)",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P1,14
"Optimum cut-off grades with different types of objective functions are determined by optimization algorithms which recognized as the one of the basis of sustainable development indicators of mining. As different mineral processing methods are applied in mines, it is very essential to choose the most appropriate cut-off grades determination algorithm. The current paper is going to analyze the bioheap leaching method and their associated environmental considerations on optimum cut-off grades policy. Remarking the importance of capital costs, these costs are evaluated in the model. Since the recovery of processing methods are changed based upon copper content, the recovery is considered variable in determining optimum cut-off grades. Presented model is evaluated in Sungun Copper Mine where the hydrometallurgical tests confirm the possibility of using bioheap leaching method to extract copper from its sulfide ores. It is observed that using bio-heap leaching method for low grade copper ores is subjected not only to improve the NPV of copper mines but also to decrease the adverse environmental impacts and produce sustainable results from mining activities.","Volume 46, Part 1, Pages 1-142 (December 2015)",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P1,14
"The fast growing demand of minerals due to increasing level of consumption has got the mining industries focus on developing and developed countries. Generally mining and mineral operation is an excellent contributor to economic growth and development in each country. Presently in many countries, the mining sector intends to augment their production operation with private participation due to the challenges that they are facing like, cost reduction, improving capital project management, employee management, environmental impacts, enhancing corporate social responsibility, global economy crisis, etc. The benefits of outsourcing are not only reduced cost in operations but also increased productivity and efficiency, accessing the relevant technical experts, implementation of the latest technologies like green technologies for green mining and ultimately increase in profit. Moreover, the mining industries receive significant global attention due to the nature of their environmental and social responsibilities, and it is necessary for the mining sector to turn their operation towards green practices. The proper vendor selection for production outsourcing may bring the solution to the challenges faced by the mining industries. The vendor selection in mining industries depends on varieties of conflicting tangible and intangible criteria and this paper deals with the suitable vendor selection for the production process in the green mining industries based on economic and environmental benefits and risk factors. This paper proposes a model frame work with case study through the combined approach of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Taguchi loss functions. The proposed method is used to measure the loss due to the outsourcing vendor performance for the pertinent benefit and risk factors and identify the best vendor to perform an outsourcing function in the mining industry production.","Volume 46, Part 1, Pages 1-142 (December 2015)",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P1,14
"Sustainable development is a concept that attempts to shape the interaction between environment and society, so that advances in wellbeing are not accompanied by deterioration of the ecological and social systems which support life into the future. In this view, Indian mining and mineral industries, especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), are focused on developing their environmental performance through integrating sustainability practices into traditional supply chain management. They struggle, however, in their attempts to analyze and to identify influential sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices in order to increase sustainable performance. This paper analyzes and identifies dominant SSCM practices in the mining and mineral industries with the help of Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). The study uses three different research phases: identification of SSCM practices from the literature, interviews with various department managers of the Indian mining and mineral industries, and a survey conducted within the mining and mineral industries. In this paper, 25 SSCM practices were considered in fewer than six categories. Finally, the approach was applied to fifteen mining and mineral industries in India. The results of this study show that suppliers׳ ISO14000 certification practice acts as an influential role over the recommended 25 SSCM practices. It is inferred that environmental management certification is therefore essential to increase sustainability performances in Indian mining and mineral industries.","Volume 46, Part 1, Pages 1-142 (December 2015)",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P1,14
"Environmental issues from the extractive industries and especially mining are prevalent and maleficent. An effective way to manage these pernicious environmental problems is through organizational practices that include the broader supply chain. Green supply chain practices and their role in mining industry strategy and operations have not been comprehensively addressed. To address this gap in the literature, and building upon the literature in general green supply chain management and environmental decision tools, we introduce a comprehensive framework for green supply chain practices in the mining industry. The framework is categorized into six areas of practice, with detailed practices described and summarized. The green supply chain practices framework is useful for practical managerial decision making purposes such as programmatic evaluation. The framework may also be useful as a theoretical construct for empirical research on green supply chain practices in the mining industry. To exemplify the practical utility of the framework we introduce a multiple criteria evaluation of green supply programs using a novel multiple criteria approach that integrates rough set theory elements and fuzzy TOPSIS. Using illustrative data we provide an example of how the methodology can be used with the green supply chain practices framework for the mining industry.

"This paper examines current implementation status of corporate sustainability activities (CSA) in the mining industry. Specifically, it proposes and applies a multi-dimensional framework to analyze the implementation of CSA from three different angles: 1. the types of CSA from philanthropic to entrepreneurial activities, 2. the issues addressed (e.g., health, safety, environment) and 3. the step of the value chain concerned, i.e., supply, production or product-related sustainability activities. The research adopts qualitative and quantitative content analysis of sustainability reports from 16 mining companies from major mining regions and commodities. Findings from this study illustrate a broad implementation landscape of CSA with a focus on the systematic management (type) of environmental aspects (issue) at mining operations (step of the value chain). However, there are implementation challenges ahead. Although receiving growing attention, entrepreneurial sustainability activities as well as activities beyond the direct sphere of corporate influence, such as upstream supply and downstream product-related CSA, are mentioned to a lesser degree. Adopting an organizational learning and capabilities perspective, the study discusses increased exchange across corporate functions as a means to tackle these challenges and enhance corporate capabilities in dealing with these unexplored sustainability activities in the mining industry.","Volume 46, Part 1, Pages 1-142 (December 2015)",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P1,14
"Sustainable management of mining operations requires careful considerations of environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) related issues. Motivated by prior studies on accidents associated with mining operations, this paper builds a formal optimization model to address the above three sustainability related issues for a mining operation with the optimal decision on mining quantity. To be specific, we model the number of accidents as a Poisson distribution with a quantity dependent distribution parameter. We formulate the objective function via the mean-variance approach, and incorporate analytical constraints which relate to environmental sustainability and CSR into the model. We analytically derive the algorithm which can find the globally optimal solution for the optimization problem. After that, we further analyse when the mining company should consider implementing (i) the pollutant reduction technology, and (ii) the accident reduction technology. It is interesting to find that the mining company׳s degree of risk aversion affects the choice of pollutant reduction technology, but not the choice of accident reduction technology. Several other important insights are also analytically derived.","Volume 46, Part 1, Pages 1-142 (December 2015)",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P1,14
"Mining and minerals is an important industry in China. Construction projects, in particular, are on the rise in Beijing. The construction minerals sector has already started responding to sustainability challenges, as demonstrated by the construction group. Thus, construction minerals are important in city development. The aim of this study was to develop a set of measurement and proposed hybrid method to analyze sustainable development indicators within economic categories under uncertainty. Evaluating the perceptions of sustainable indicators is a complex process because the requirements for environmental compliance tend to be vague and contradictory. In this study, the uncertainties in the evaluation process were resolved using a hybrid approach, which combines fuzzy set theory, the Delphi method, and a discrete multi-criteria method based on prospect theory for uncertainty (known as TODIM in Portuguese). The advantages of the developed hybrid approach are illustrated using a case study. The results show that the fuzzy TODIM approach can easily and effectively accommodate criteria for gain and loss functions, thereby enabling managers to improve sustainability indicators and reduce the overall environmental impact under uncertainty.","Volume 46, Part 1, Pages 1-142 (December 2015)",December 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/46/part/P1,14

"Brazil is the largest country in South America in terms of both area (8,515,767,049 km2) and population (203,912,619 of inhabitants). Over the last decade, it has also become one of the world׳s fastest-growing economies; today, it is the world׳s seventh largest economy and plays a substantial role in the international oil and gas production market. The recent discovery of the huge amount of petroleum in the oceanic pre-salt layer can position Brazil as the world׳s fourth largest petroleum producer by 2030. As a result, the country is facing the challenge of finding a non-predatory development strategy for the sector, especially one that will protect the coastal environments and local communities. The Brazilian system of royalties, initially thought to counteract negative impacts, has encountered social and governmental disapproval, and has subjected the communities affected by the oil findings to considerable uncertainty and increased disputes over the fairness of the returns from the use of this resource. Both national and international experiences have shown that when mismanaged, royalties from oil production create an economy that is heavily dependent on oil, and often lead to fiscal inefficiency and corruption. These effects happen because government ownership of the oil resources alone does not guarantee social and economic development or higher quality of life for local people; this part of the population is generally the group that is harmed by the activities. The key is in defining the implementation and management frameworks for the efficient utilization of oil resources. The development of the Brazilian oil industry should account for the fact that these activities are predominantly carried out in the coastal zone, a region whose ecological and economic relevance was recognized by the Brazilian Constitution of 1988, which gave it the status of a national heritage site. This study discusses Brazilian practices in royalty management and compares them to international experiences in terms of legal, social and economical aspects. We also provide a historical summary of the use of oil resources in Brazil, advocating for responsible utilization that includes obligatory compensation for social or environmental impacts on coastal and oceanic zones.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"Recent research has identified the presence of behavioral influences on traders in predominantly professionally traded markets such as oil, gold, and foreign exchange. Previous research had largely confined behavioral-based investigations to equity markets due to an assumption that noise traders would drive any influence and these traders were mainly absent from the professionally traded markets. This paper extends this research to the non-ferrous metals markets and demonstrates similar influences on prices. It is shown that psychological price barriers, where there is predictable trading patterns around psychologically important price points, are important. Specifically, lead, zinc, and aluminium alloy show anomalous price reactions in the days particularly following a breach of a $1000 price point. There is also evidence presented of negative price clustering before key price barriers. Subperiod tests further indicate that the relevant psychological price point is dependent on average prices. Recognizing the multiple hypothesis testing nature of the study, Generalized Bonferroni corrections are implemented to provide a robust control for the possibility of data mining. This represents a first investigation of behavioral influences in non-ferrous metals prices, and suggests that these markets are not immune to trader biases influencing the setting of prices.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"Natural non-renewable resources, such as minerals, are becoming increasingly depleted against a backdrop of intense industrialisation. Through the exergy analysis and thermoeconomic tools it is possible to assign a figure to the degree of depletion. This is because the exergy replacement cost represents the effort needed by humankind to return minerals to their original conditions from the “commercially dead state”, Thanatia. The authors undertake an evaluation of the ten most significantly produced minerals in Colombia, since 1990. Via the 2011 mineral balance, this paper shows that the highest exergetic losses are in the extraction for export and not national consumption rates. The loss in mineral wealth, quantified in exergy terms for 2011 is 119.2 Mtoe (4.99×109 GJ) and has, since 1990, accumulated to 1,543.4 Mtoe (6.46×1010 GJ).

The paper presents the sources, mechanisms and results of such a moral panic based on the examples from Poland concerning various kinds of mineral resources that are extracted with the use of different methods and on a different scale. The perceived threats associated with mineral exploitation are often exaggerated and sometimes completely false, which is because society is susceptible to manipulation by the media. This causes substantial financial losses not only for exploration and mining companies which are forced to give up their projects even though particular environmental requirements are met, but also for the local communities themselves since they are deprived of potential jobs as well as income from taxes and mining royalties. The phenomenon of moral panic related to mineral development is a serious problem also because local government activists increasingly more often create such a panic out of political expediency. This kind of panic can also be created by other interest groups. It should be emphasised that resistance to a moral panic does not mean that one cannot object to geological and mining activities when this is justified; then such protests can be even more effective.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15

"This article focuses on the mining activities of Turkish Coal Enterprises (TKI), the major lignite supplier in Turkey. First, we analyzed the lignite production and overburden removal activities of TKI from a historical perspective and then employed the Principle Component Analysis to build a mining efficiency index of TKI and investigated its historical development since the establishment of the company. We found that labor productivity and operational structure have been the most important factors, positively affecting the index. The current article makes two important contributions: (1) by using the most comprehensive data set available on TKI for the first time, and (2) by developing a Mining Efficiency Index (MEI), which can be used to analyze productivity in lignite mining activities in different countries.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"Mining industry needs a social license to operate (SLO) on local, national and global levels. In this research we study six companies in three different countries in the Kolarctic Area. All except one company seem to focus on getting the social license at the local level with agreements with other land users and local communities. For new companies a local social license seems to be more difficult to earn, but the old ones have gained it with their earlier behavior. In Sweden and Finland companies also focus on global standards, mostly because of the pressure from financers. In the mining branch, endusers are not yet interested in social responsibility of the companies. Globally functioning multinationals have, however, been alerted to develop industrial standards under the pressure of NGOs. In some mining sectors such as gold mining, international standards already play a significant role. In gaining the social license, the involvement of NGOs, which now is rather modest, might be one way to develop global standards and improve reputation. Companies, which are successfully focusing on the local level, might also gain from NGO cooperation on the national level, where the reputation of the mining industry in Sweden and especially in Finland has suffered from sporadic bad performers. Russian companies have their own challenges because of the weak formal institutions of the country. There both good national relations with the power structures and a strong role in developing the surrounding areas are fundamental.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"The Niger Delta is home to the third largest mangrove forest in the world, endowed with extensive freshwater swamp and tropical rain forests, which are rich in unique biological diversity. However, the region has experienced a wide range of environmental pollution and degradation as a result of decadal extraction of its huge hydrocarbon reserves. Despite the financial benefits accruing from hydrocarbon export, it has raised serious environmental concerns in the region. The pollution has heavily impacted on the ecosystem and health of the inhabitants. Prominent among the hydrocarbon-induced pollution include oil spill, gas flaring, and pipeline explosions. Over 10,000 oil spill and pipeline explosion incidents have been recorded and more than 350 billion cubic metres of gas have been flared in the region in the last 14 years. These have caused huge human and material losses in addition to environmental degradation and poor air quality. The region׳s ecosystem has therefore been declared one of the most endangered ecosystems in the world. This paper reviewed past and current research on the impact of pollutions from oil and gas exploitation activities, alongside the history of hydrocarbon exploration in the region. It importantly outlined the geographies of the pollution, showing their magnitude and spatial spread to demonstrate how they may have impacted on the wellbeing of the inhabitants of the region. In addition, the paper reviewed lapses in the country׳s legal framework that has encouraged such practices harmful to the environment. It critically analysed the failure of the relevant legal framework in imposing responsible attitudes and behaviours on the oil and gas companies towards the environment.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"The objective of the paper is to synthesize the existing empirical research on mining, regional development and benefit-sharing in developed countries. Specifically, the paper presents a review of the literature addressing how the regional development impacts of mining ventures (e.g., employment multipliers) can be comprehended and assessed empirically, as well as the role of various benefit-sharing instruments in generating a more inclusive development. These issues are investigated in the context of selected practical experiences in four high-income mining countries (Australia, Canada, Chile and the USA). Important issues and challenges that deserve increased attention in future research are identified. These include, for instance, the relationship between mining competitiveness and benefit-sharing, and the efficient use of regional development investment funds.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"Appreciating the pricing arrangements for a mineral and its compounds provides useful insight into the nature of its market and the industrial structure of its production. This paper focuses on the case of lithium, which has emerged from being a minor metal with limited profitable applications in 1950 to its glamour metal status some 65 years later. During this period bilateral contracts based on producer prices have been the major way in which prices have been negotiated. The entry of a major new producer (SQM) in the late 1990s led to a situation where price information was difficult to obtain, even though competition in the sector was growing. This is consistent with a movement from cooperative oligopoly to non-cooperative oligopoly. Growing price transparency since 2010 has been associated with the actual and projected entry of several new producers. With its continuing growth it seems inevitable that lithium will be formally traded on one of major metal exchanges within the next decade. In addition to this, the practice of transfer pricing between branches of established multinational producers also applies to the lithium industry.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15

"Flexibility and operational adaptability are essential for long term corporate success and real option (RO) appears suitable for analysing risky projects. Nevertheless, its application in engineering design has been slow-moving compared to financial uses. Therefore, there is a compelling argument for using visual, intuitive and transparent models, such as the binomial decision tree, which has the potential to eliminate decision maker apprehension and improve RO use in engineering design and decision making. This paper reviews RO applications in mining projects and proposes a new methodology to explore technical applications of RO in mine design and decision making at the mine operational level. The research will investigate the suitability of using the RO method at the mine operational level where production decisions are made frequently, rather than organisational strategies that are reviewed after several years. The proposed approach is applied to a case study. This will demonstrate how RO can be used in designing multiple pits in multi-zone ore deposits to create a switching option between pits regarding changing ore grades and fluctuating commodity prices. The main rationale of this option involves deferring waste materials by switching mining activities from a high to low strip ratio pit. This creates a choice between using new RO thinking and the traditional methodology. The option is analysed using the binomial decision tree. The results summarised in this paper׳s conclusion reveal that the project׳s value increased considerably when flexibility was included in the mine design. These increases in project value were between eight to 15 per cent, depending on the number of flexible options incorporated into the design.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"There are numerous countries that have a variety of mineral products and commodities which are the source of government revenue and foreign exchange. Mineral revenues are essential for the development of mineral rich countries. Generally, the minerals market has many risks; therefore the revenue gained from minerals is accompanied with a level of risk. In order to plan for mineral revenue by governments, the risk of mineral revenue should be decreased. In this paper, minerals are considered as risky assets to apply the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). This method is able to decrease the risk of minerals׳ revenue by optimum diversification. As a case study, mineral production of Iran׳s mining sector is studied. The non-linear model is solved by quadratic programming. To achieve the country׳s expected revenue the model determines the type and quantity of minerals to be produced. The findings show that the MPT model has an adequate potential to reduce the risk of the government׳s mineral revenue compared with the current situation.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"According to the most common financial theories, the price of a futures contract is always influenced by the spot price of its underlying asset (the cost-of-carry model) or by the expected future spot price conditional on information set (the asset-pricing theory). The aim of this paper is to analyze the dynamic relationship between spot and futures prices, and to establish if there is the possibility of a valid “period by period” prediction of the futures price conditional on the prediction of the spot price, and vice-versa. The empirical analysis is conducted on the two most important energy commodities, crude oil and natural gas, and on gold, the most important commodity used for risk hedging and investment during financial turmoil, paying particular attention to the exogeneity issue. We estimate a battery of recursive bivariate VAR models over a sample of daily spot and futures prices, ranging from January 1997 to May 2014. Our results show that some interactions between spot and futures prices clearly exist and they mainly depend on commodity type and futures contracts maturity. Thus, a strong exogeneity operates in the case of the natural gas, while this is not the case for the crude oil, where the exogeneity generally is weak and depends on the contract maturity. On the gold market the results show no possibility of a valid forecasting between spot and futures prices.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"Metal price movement is a complicated process with significant fluctuations, exhibiting nonlinear characteristics. With the proposed Heterogeneous Market Hypothesis (HMH), we argue that the macroscale nonlinear price movement consists of a diverse range of data components such as chaotic and multi-scale data characteristics at the microscopic level. In order to model the hidden data features, we propose a new Curvelet based forecasting algorithm. To model the dynamic chaotic data characteristics in the original time series, we project the original time series into the reconstructed phase space using the time delay method. The Curvelet denoising method is used for separating and reducing the disruption from noise in the transformed state space. Results from empirical studies conducted in the major metal markets suggest that the proposed model achieves statistically more robust and superior performance than traditional benchmark model.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"This article focuses on a new measure of global co-movement defined as influence: the average partial correlation of one asset with respect to others. The influence of nominal returns and real price cycles of various commodities is computed for the period of January 1968–December 2013. The estimation results show that there is strong co-movement among the average influences of nominal returns of industrial and precious metals since 2003. From an investor׳s perspective, this suggests a reduction in the benefits of portfolio diversification and a convergence towards a single metal class. On the other hand, and as expected, average influence among unrelated commodity returns is generally negligible, except for the period of financial turmoil of 2007–2010. By contrast the influence of real price cycles tends to be highly significant over the whole sample period, even among unrelated commodities. These findings indicate that economic agents׳ perceiving all commodities as a sole asset class is essentially a short-term phenomenon linked to business cycles. Two extensions of this framework are discussed: macroeconomic determinants of commodity influence and portfolio investment decisions.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"Do natural resources influence political trust? I provide a new answer to this question by articulating a theory of political trust that relates to within-country variation in natural resource extraction rather than the more traditional empirical context of cross-country variation. The distributional consequences of natural resources within countries have a large, positive consequences on political trust. Residents within a mining district may experience disproportionate economic benefits compared to residents living in a non-mining district. These economic benefits, in turn, influence political trust.

"Uranium-bearing coal deposits are occasionally mentioned as a potential source of supply for nuclear fuels. The production of uranium from coal-ash has remained sub-economic for decades, but the emergence of new projects has once again raised a number of questions. How much coal-ash do we have? Are the coal deposits all rich in uranium? Can the uranium content always be recovered?This study shows that there are significant quantities of uranium in the ash produced by the world coal consumption: between 7 ktU and 13 ktU in 2012. Yet, most of this ash correspond to very low grade ores and potential production capacities should not exceed 700 tU/yr in today’s economic conditions (between 40 and 70 $/lbU3O8 for both spot and long-term price over the period 2011–2014 (Ux Consulting, 2015)), i.e. approximately 1% of current needs. On the long-term, the sensitivity of the production potential to economic factors (cut-off grade, uranium price) and coal-consumption scenarios is moderate. Economic production from coal-ash should not exceed a couple of percents of uranium needs.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) has been sold by its advocates as a badly needed way to enhance access to information in the extractive industries sector and improve government accountability. It has also been lauded as enabling energy companies to demonstrate their responsibility and sustainability, enabling countries to attract more foreign investment, and enabling communities to engage in dialogue with national planners over energy issues. In this paper, we ask: does it work? Do countries adhering to EITI standards actually see selected governance metrics improve? To answer this question, this article first briefly summarizes the history of the EITI and details the hypothetical benefits espoused by its supporters. It then proceeds to “test” these benefits by qualitatively assessing the performance of EITI for the first two countries to achieve candidacy, Azerbaijan and Liberia. The paper finds that while the EITI affirms the salience of reliable information and data about the extractive industries, it is difficult to attribute governance improvements casually to the EITI. Moreover, the EITI reveals an inherent paradox about the virtues of transparency and also underscores that much of the damage from mining and hydrocarbon development is socially and economically unavoidable.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"This study uses a VECM with impulse response, variance decomposition and block Granger causality analysis to investigate the effects of international and domestic factors on the production of platinum group metals (PGM) in South Africa from 1980 to 2011. The results of the impulse responses show that shocks to the international factors negatively affect production while domestic shocks positively affect production. The variance decompositions find that in the long-run, production is most significantly impacted by international demand, domestic electricity tariffs, and salary shocks. The block Granger causality analysis further finds that the international factors causally affect the domestic factors, but production is driven by PGM price fluctuations, electricity tariffs, and output per employee.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"The article analyzes the emergence of and practices related to corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies of the mining industry in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The study draws from an analysis of publicly available CSR reports and additional interviews with the stakeholders of the mining industry in these countries. The forms and emergence of corporate social responsibility policies with relevance to the mining industry and the post-socialist context are first reviewed. The roles of the national and local contexts in the formation of the CSR practices are then investigated. The differences of the emergent CSR models in these two countries are analyzed, as well as the underlying factors for the differences or similarities. It is concluded that despite the shared Soviet legacy, the CSR policies of the mining companies have clearly been diverging in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The difference emerges from the ways in which the mining companies adapt their CSR practices to the different sets of stakeholders. The CSR practices are influenced strongly by the national context in which the mining operations are conducted. The study shows that CSR activities of the mining industry should be analyzed as consisting of global commitments on the one hand, and varying forms of national and local scale implementations on the other hand.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"Sustainability goals of a social planner in an inefficient economy may require a wider range of tools than prescribed by a model that assumes dynamic efficiency. The need for additional tools can be shown by considering both the planner׳s model and a more comprehensive one that imitates real life. A new tool is necessary if the level of inefficiency, resulting from the discrepancy between the model and “real life”, can undermine any feasible effort advised by the planner׳s model. This study assumes that the planner applies the policies developed for a simple model, whereas the real economy is distorted by neglected effects that influence utility, production, the balance equation, and the dynamics of the natural resource stock. The resulting inefficiency affects the dependence of current utility change on investment. The analysis shows that a prescription for sustainability requires estimation of possible inefficiencies and coordination of genuine investment with inefficiency-reducing policies, including changes in accounting systems and institutions.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15

"The impressive recent GDP growth performance in DRC has not contributed to significantly reduce the high levels of initial poverty that were inherited from long years of war and mismanagement. Using a CGE-microsimulation model of the DRC, this study assesses the economywide growth and distributional effects of mining-based growth. Unlike other studies, this paper went a step further by comparing the results of mining-led growth to an alternative more broad-based development strategy where DRC develops shared capabilities required to engineer growth in the manufacturing sector. The findings suggest that mining will remain the key driver of DRC exports but not possibly the source of economic growth. The most plausible reason is the existence of the Dutch disease and the structural change that it generates. These structural effects will remain permanent even in the long-run unless the government implements a deliberative industrial policy. Interestingly, the results highlight the possible role of artisanal mining and demand for domestic agricultural and food products in improving the welfare of poor rural households. Finally, the findings show that policies to develop shared capabilities required to engineer growth in the manufacturing sector generate a productive transformation that produces pro-poor effects.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"This paper examines the main drivers of intertemporal and cross-country variation in steel consumption using a fixed-effects panel model of 26 OECD countries over the period 1970–2012. The results indicate that per capita GDP is the main driver of steel consumption, however, investment spending, and the rates of industrialisation and urbanisation are also important determinants. Per capita steel consumption is found to be concave with respect to per capita GDP, suggesting that the growth rate in steel consumption slows as a country's level of economic development advances. Through the inclusion of a set of time dummy variables, there is evidence of the leapfrogging effect of Hwang and Tilton, 1990. Resour. Policy. 16(3), pp. 210–224, in which improvements in the efficiency of material use and material substitution reduced per capita steel consumption by around 1% per annum over the sample period, albeit mainly in the 1970s and 1980s.

"The dynamics of metal prices are not only highly relevant for consumers due to their extensive uses in various industries, but also for a number of producing countries. For these countries, export earning are often the main source of revenues. Therefore, the precise examination of metal prices, their long and short-run cyclical behavior, and their co-movement is essential for economic planing and forecasting purposes. This study examines the dynamics of 20 monthly price series of a variety of mineral commodities during the past 100 years. Compared to early studies, who are either restricted to the history of the recent 50–60 years or are based on yearly data frequency, this data set is a huge advantage. Co-movement, short-run cycles and super cycles are analyzed by means of common statistical methods and compared to the results in the literature. Findings suggest that metal prices do not necessarily follow similar patterns. Although a common pattern is discernible within certain metal groups such as precious metals and non-ferrous metals, other metal groups like electrical metals and steel alloys can show very different price dynamics with respect to co-movement and short-run price cycles. However, the results in the literature concerning super cycles (1910–1938, 1938–1968, 1968–1996, 1996–ongoing) can usually be confirmed for the data set in this study.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"The phenomenon of regional “resource curse” appeared gradually with the rapid development of Chinese economy. China with heavy energy consumption reliance on coal tried to get balance between economic stability and regional development by resource tax reform. In our dynamic computable general equilibrium model (CGE), the paper looked into the influences on economy, resource and environment with different coal resource tax policy scenarios from a regional perspective. The stimulated results showed coal resource tax reform had a negative influence on Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, coal resource tax reform can increase regional revenues (especially in resource-rich regions) which helped to explain the exaltation of GDP in some regions, and seemed to be a highly potential way for narrowing regional economic gap. “Resource curse” regions reduction depended on resource tax rate which affected the supply and demand of elementary factors, and prevented human and capital resource crowded from the processing of the productions. And resource tax burden has alleviated as resource value subsidy for households and firms by using more alternative resources. Meanwhile, subsidy improved the quality of resource and environment. So we suggested that resource tax rate and subsidy should be taken into account in eliminating regional “resource curse” and coordinate resource and environment system within coal resource tax reform.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"Mineral deposit attributes are: renewability specific location controlled by geology, and the important role of meeting the needs of society. Their resources should be therefore rationally used. It requires in particular safeguarding access to deposits areas. The way to indicate the valuable deposits to protect them seems to be their valuation, using uniform criteria. The authors present a simple method of mineral deposits value ranking. It consists of deposits ranking value in four, separate domains: quality and size (resources) of deposit, as a main domain, mining conditions, environmental conditions, and land-use planning restrictions. Size of deposit and mineral (rock) quality parameters were defined for each kind of mineral commodity. Mining conditions were described by the degree of exploitation difficulties and the possibility to deliver the raw material to customers. Both environmental and land-use planning domains indicate some limits related to nature protection, housing and industrial building. Within each of four domains of evaluation 3 categories were distinguished, allowing for the specification of each deposit through a four letter symbol.

"As part of efforts to position the United States as a leader in clean energy technology production, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued two Critical Materials Strategy reports, which assessed 16 materials on the basis of their importance to clean energy development and their supply risk (U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), 2010, DOE, 2011). To understand the implications for clean energy of disruptions in supplies of critical materials, it is important to understand supply chain dynamics from mining to final product production. As a case study of critical material supply chains, we focus on the supply of two rare earth metals, neodymium (Nd) and dysprosium (Dy), for permanent magnets used in wind turbines, electric vehicles and other applications. We introduce GCMat, a dynamic agent-based model that includes interacting agents at five supply chain stages consisting of mining, metal refining, magnet production, final product production and demand. Agents throughout the supply chain make pricing, production and inventory management decisions. Deposit developers choose which deposits to develop based on market conditions and detailed data on 57 rare earth deposits. Wind turbine and electric vehicle producers choose from a set of possible production technologies that require different amounts of rare earths. We ran the model under a baseline scenario and four alternative scenarios with different demand and production technology inputs. Model results from 2010 to 2013 fit well with historical data. Projections through 2025 show a number of possible future price, demand, and supply trajectories. For each scenario, we highlight reasons for turning points under market conditions, for differences between Nd and Dy markets, and for differences between scenarios. Because GCMat can model causal dynamics and provide fine-grain representation of agents and their decisions, it provides explanations for turning points under market conditions that are not otherwise available from other modeling approaches. Our baseline projections show very different behaviors for Nd and Dy prices. Nd prices continue to drop and remain low even at the end of our simulation period as new capacity comes online and leads to a market in which production capacity outpaces demand. Dy price movements, on the other hand, change directions several times with several key turning points related to inventory behaviors of particular agents in the supply chain and asymmetric supply and demand trends. Scenario analyses show the impact of stronger demand growth for rare earths, and in particular finds that Nd price impacts are significantly delayed as compared to Dy. This is explained by the substantial excess production capacity for Nd in the early simulation years that keeps prices down. Scenarios that explore the impact of reducing the Dy content of magnets show the intricate interdependencies of these two markets as price trends for both rare earths reverse directions – reducing the Dy content of magnets reduces Dy demand, which drives down Dy prices and translates into lower magnet prices. This in turn raises the demand for magnets and therefore the demand for Nd and eventually drives up the Nd price.",Volume 45,September 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/45/suppl/C,15
"The theory of storage predicts that convenience yield and inventory level of the same commodity are in an inverse relationship. Conceptually, inventories which are readily accessible by market participants at a given location drive the perceived benefits of owning the physical commodity. The price hike observed in the global base metal markets especially during the pre- and post-global financial crisis period is largely attributed to an exponential consumption growth in Asian countries. Geographical location, according to our study, affects the explanatory power of inventories for changes in convenience yield perceived by market participants at a certain location. In particular, we use data for three different regions, namely, Asia, Americas and Europe, for six major base metals. We test whether one certain region explains the changes of convenience yield better than other regions. Our results indicate that the Asian region is more informative than other regions and thereby accessible inventories are likely to have a stronger impact on the perceived convenience yield.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"In this work, we analyse the relationship between European domestic prices and the prices prevailing in two major trading regions, China and the USA. We also consider the relationship between prices and the volume of imports into Europe. The analysis seeks to determine two aspects related to pricing in the stainless steel market. It first seeks to determine whether China׳s current standing as the largest worldwide producer of stainless steel is relevant in defining its price. Stemming from the first question, we secondly seek to understand if the European market is simply one component in the global stainless steel market with no significant power in pricing determination. Through a co-integration analysis and the vector error correction model, the estimates suggest that prices in Europe and the US react to at least two of the three long-run relationships, whereas China׳s price reacts only to the long-term relationship with the US. Moreover, results express that China׳s price cause in Granger sense to the European prices, but the reverse relationship does not hold. With respect to European imports, there is a long-run relationship between import volume and Chinese and German prices. The German short-run price elasticity is larger than one, and import demand tends to be income elastic. The study primarily concludes that European producers of stainless steel are price followers, and that the volume of imports into Europe is affected by long-run relations of relative prices.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16

Study 1 (N=210) found that when the key impacts and benefits were considered simultaneously, mining׳s environmental impact was the major factor leading to rejection of mining, followed by impacts on other sectors such as agriculture, with impacts on living cost had no significant bearing on people׳s attitude toward mining. On the benefit side, creating employment and promoting mining community development were the most important benefits leading to participants׳ acceptance of mining, followed by benefit in general wealth and regional infrastructure improvement. Further analysis indicated that participants were not prepared to compromise their concern over environmental impact when weighing benefits over costs. Study 2 largely replicated the findings of Study 1 with a larger and nationally representative sample (N=2590). Further analyses in Study 2 showed that confidence in governance institutions (i.e., perceived legislative and government regulative capacities in holding the mining industry accountable) played an important role in moderating the effect of environmental impact on acceptance of mining. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of managing development of the mining sector in Australia.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"How much richer would the oil producing countries, in the Middle East, be if they invested all their natural resource rent? This study tries to answer this question by calculating the counterfactuals of capital stock and income under two major scenarios. Combining several data sets, including a unique one on sovereign wealth funds, it finds that the oil producing economies of the MENA region could have had on average about 0.4 percentage point higher growth rate if they had used their natural resource rents efficiently. This difference in growth rate translates to about 17% higher income over a 40 year period. These numbers are calculated for each country separately and their important policy implications are discussed.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"This paper analyses the statistical properties of five major precious metal prices (gold, silver, rhodium, palladium and platinum) based on a fractional integration modelling framework while identifying structural breaks. We use monthly data from 1972:1 to 2013:12. Our results indicate orders of integration that are equal to or greater than 1 (long memory) in all cases except for silver and palladium where we find strong evidence of mean reversion with a parametric and semiparametric method, respectively. Given some inconsistencies between the parametric and semiparametric results, we suspect the possibility of structural breaks and our results show evidence of structural breaks in almost all cases except palladium. However, after accounting for structural breaks, we find evidence of an increase in the degree of persistence across time in the majority of cases. This implies that in general, shocks to these precious metals will be permanent requiring strong policy measures to return the series to their equilibrium levels in the event of negative shocks.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"Graphite is one of the most important raw materials in modern industry. China contains an abundance of this resource and is the largest graphite producer, importer/exporter and consumer of high-performance graphite products worldwide. In the present paper, 416 data points depicting the monthly volume and price of graphite imports and exports in China from 2003 to the first half of 2012 were collected for analysis. A time series econometrics method was used to investigate the variance and causality relationship between the graphite import and export volumes. The results show a significant increase in China׳s graphite export volumes from 2003 to the first half of 2012. The graphite export volumes of the first half of 2012 were 329 thousand tons, representing a 53% increase compared to the same period in 2003. The annual average price of graphite exports has increased 43.4% in the last decade. A significant decrease in export volumes was noted most years during the two major Chinese holidays: the Chinese Spring Festival in February and National Day in October. The global financial crisis in 2008 caused a dramatic reduction in the growth rate of graphite import volumes, and the European debt crisis in 2011 caused both a decrease in import volumes and a rapid increase in export prices. The volume of graphite exports in China was more than 5.6 times higher than the volume of imports, but 52.2–138.4% of export earnings were spent on the import bill. There is a unidirectional causality relationship between graphite export volume and export price in China, but no causality relationship was found between graphite import volume and import price. The phenomena and factors identified above have implications for China׳s graphite industry development and graphite import and export trade.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"The Japanese government and industries have been attempting to secure the future availability of mineral resources, because Japan imports most of its metals. To mitigate supply risk, the acquisition of mineral interests in foreign mining projects has been declared a pillar of the government׳s resource strategies. The sufficiency of the mineral interests held by Japanese companies, however, has not been evaluated quantitatively from a long-term perspective. By focusing on resource entitlements that accompany mineral interests, we developed an indicator named “reserve entitlements to demand ratio” that can be used to compare the sufficiency of mineral interests held between different metals. We then calculated the indicator for 17 metals and found that Japan held relatively high levels of entitlements for niobium, tungsten and lead in 2012, whereas it was quite low for palladium, platinum, and tin. The results revealed the possible overrating of supply risk for those highly-entitled metals and vice versa in the past assessments because they failed to consider the mineral interest as a criticality component. The developed methodology supports the choice of measures for securing mineral resources in Japan׳s resource strategy.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"Recently, interest in thorium׳s potential use in a nuclear fuel cycle has been renewed. Thorium is more abundant, at least on average, than uranium in the earth׳s crust and, therefore, could theoretically extend the use of nuclear energy technology beyond the economic limits of uranium resources. This paper provides an economic assessment of thorium availability by creating cumulative-availability and potential mining-industry cost curves, based on known thorium resources. These tools provide two perspectives on the economic availability of thorium. In the long term, physical quantities of thorium likely will not be a constraint on the development of a thorium fuel cycle. In the medium term, however, thorium supply may be limited by constraints associated with its production as a by-product of rare earth elements and heavy mineral sands. Environmental concerns, social issues, regulation, and technology also present issues for the medium and long term supply of thorium.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"This paper uses quantile regression estimation techniques so as to investigate the relationship between resource funds, governance and institutional quality by paying special attention to the distribution of the latter. The estimation results indicate that resource funds are associated with better governance and institutions. The positive correlation is identified for the entire distribution of governance and institutional quality variables indicating that resource-rich countries can benefit from the establishment of resource funds, irrespective of whether they are found at the lower or at the upper end of the ranking of governance and institutional performance. The results offer evidence in support of the view that resource funds are valid tools of insulation against the “resource curse” as manifested through governance and institutional quality deterioration. Resource funds may support policy making and strengthen governance and institutional formations not only in countries with good governance and institutions but also in countries which lag behind in the latter.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"Economic diversification is important for building sustainable economic growth. Thus, an economy that is highly dependent on income from a natural resource is in danger of instability or even collapse if the price of such commodity decreases in the global market. Additionally, economic diversification contributes positively to creating jobs, fighting corruption, and improving the institutional quality of countries. The Saudi government has issued 10 development plans since 1970, each covering five years, and economic diversification is a main objective of all these plans. This paper examines the government׳s efforts to diversify the economy using four variables: oil share of gross domestic product (GDP), share of private sector in GDP, oil exports as a percentage of the country׳s exports, and oil revenues as a percentage of total revenues. The current analysis covers nine development plans from 1970 through 2013. The analysis concludes that, after more than 40 years of development plans aiming to diversify the Saudi economy, oil is still the main engine driving the economy. The Saudi government needs to fully consider economic diversification as a tool for better governance.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"Existing research finds little evidence that speculative activity in futures markets has any impact on precious metals׳ spot prices. We examine whether speculators׳ positions predict returns and return volatility in precious metals futures markets. We use two proxies for speculative activity: non-commercial traders and money managers. Money managers are a subcategory of non-commercial traders that is associated with professional speculators. Our analysis distinguishes between short- and long-term dynamics. Whereas we cannot confirm any short-term impact of speculators on returns and conditional volatility in the period after 2006, the weekly changes in non-commercial traders׳ positions appear to have a destabilizing impact on subsequent conditional volatility in gold, silver, and palladium futures markets in the period prior to June 2006. Moreover, we cannot rule out a long-term, potentially destabilizing, impact on returns when accumulated positions of speculators over monthly horizons are considered.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"Restructuring entire industries within changing economic systems remains a great challenge. This restructuring is a project of extraordinary scale, including entire regions and even a whole economy. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to assess the restructuring of coal mining in Poland from 1990 to 2013 in combination with identification of directions for its further development to guarantee survival of the industry in current market conditions. To achieve the objective, the empirical part of the paper presents the causes, process and effects of restructuring from two perspectives. The first is a macroperspective which concerns coal mining in Poland as a sector. The second is a microperspective in which the largest Polish coal producers, together with their 24 colliery structures, are analyzed. Additionally, in the theoretical part of the paper—including the introduction with the literature study—the review of previous research on restructuring is presented in order to establish the background of the analysis and evaluation that were conducted.It can be concluded from the research results that in more than twenty years of industry restructuring in Poland, only a portion of the restructuring aims have been achieved. Importantly, these aims include reductions in employment and increases in productivity but only partial and periodic increases in efficiency. However, many of the collieries have not accomplished a sustainable improvement in efficiency.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"We analyze the dynamic comovement of commodity futures returns within each category (energy, precious metals, industrial metals, and agriculture) from 1997 to 2013 under the effects of the financialization of commodity markets. Our findings from the dynamic equicorrelation GARCH model of Engle and Kelly (2012) show evidence of convergence for precious and industrial metal commodity futures since mid-2000s. On the other hand, there is no sign of convergence across the agricultural commodity futures, with most of them moving in a unrelated manner. Finally, a relatively high level of convergence is found for energy commodity futures, except for natural gas futures which expectedly behave significantly different from the other energy commodity futures. As a whole, our results suggest some potential for diversification benefits within commodity-specific categories, but at the same time the predominance of physical supply/demand balance as the main driving force of the commodity futures price dynamics rather than global financial conditions.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"The national economic importance of a metal is usually considered as one of the indicators of this metal׳s vulnerability to supply restrictions at a national level. In a context of developed economies in which service activities stand for the largest share of GDP, this study proposes to account for the interplays between economic activities, including service activities, in the assessment of a metal׳s national economic importance. An index for qualifying a metal׳s relative economic importance is defined in such a way as to highlight to what extent the value added domestically induced by each domestic final use is dependent on this metal. The methodology, based on hybrid monetary physical Input–Output Analysis, is described and applied to the case of copper in France for the year 2008. “Constructions and construction works” represent the largest contribution to the index of copper׳s national economic importance. The hidden copper consumptions induced by the final uses of certain services (e.g. “public administration and defense services”) imply that these are more critical in terms of supply restrictions than some other copper-containing products (e.g. “computer, electronic and optical products”). The limitations and corresponding necessary future developments of such an approach are finally discussed.",Volume 44,June 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/44/suppl/C,16
"Abandoned mines can pose risks to the natural environment, humans and economies and prevent multiple or sequential uses of affected land. They range in size from individual shafts to large polluting open cut mines. Across Australia, there are over 50,000 abandoned mines on public and private land. A coordinated, effective management response is required to remediate these sites and reduce liabilities. We propose a novel maturity model for the evaluation of abandoned mine remediation programs and by applying it to Australian jurisdictions, demonstrate the potential for the model to be applied globally. The model incorporates 14 hierarchical evaluative criteria (including social, environmental and economic factors) which are each assessed against five performance indicators. These were derived from prior research and an Australian national policy for abandoned mines. We used the model to compare Australian jurisdictions to a leading practice benchmark jurisdiction, British Columbia, Canada, using web-accessible information and – in two cases – self-evaluation. The amount of publicly-available information varied widely between jurisdictions. Most Australian jurisdictions were ranked as less mature than the British Columbia program for most criteria. We then explain how the maturity model can be used to implement an existing regulatory framework specifically, the Australian Strategic Framework for Managing Abandoned Mines in the Minerals Industry, and discuss how the model can be applied to evaluate progress and prioritise improvements to abandoned mine management programs globally. A systematic approach to monitoring and evaluating abandoned mines programs is essential for improved accountability and to demonstrate change in liability over time. A systematic approach will also support shared learning and continual improvement within, and across, jurisdictions.",Volume 43,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/43/suppl/C,17
"China is currently the largest producer of rare earths in the world, mining at least 90% of world total production. Because of China׳s dominant position in global rare earths production and the constant development of rare earths terminal industries, the study of China׳s rare earth supply trends has gradually been a hot topic of world interest. However, the literature shows that previous research has mainly focused on the estimation of rare earth supply and its influence based on experiential judge of current and premonitory new rare earth production capacity, rather than on quantitative modeling. The results are usually estimations of the productions of near future rather than longer term. Forecasts by mine types are particularly rare. Considering the different applications and demands of different rare earth elements, the Generalized Weng model, a widely used quantitative model in exhaustible resource forecast, is adopted in this study to predict the production of the three major rare earths in China (namely, mixed rare earth, bastnasite and ion-absorbed rare earth) before 2050. The results show that production of mixed rare earth will peak in 2014 at 62,757 t, followed thereafter by an annual decline of 2%; production of bastnasite will peak in 2018 at 32,312 t, preceded by an annual increase of 1.67% and followed by an annual decrease of 4%; production of ion-absorbed rare earth will peak in 2024 at 45,793 t, preceded by an annual increase of 1.72% and followed by an annual decrease of 4%. Based on these findings, Chinese government should enforce environmental and resource exhaustible taxes soon and different domestic regulations for different rare earths according to their different production potential. Countries without resource endowments should make efforts to develop rare earth recycling technologies and seek substitutes for rare earth resources, in addition to keeping good international trading relationships. Countries with some kind of rare earths should start or restart their rare earth mines to gradually reduce dependence on China׳s supply.",Volume 43,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/43/suppl/C,17
"Compensation remains a crucial precondition for the compulsory acquisition of land in many jurisdictions across the world. The compensation regime of Ghana is still characterised by uncertainties with the legislative environment. This paper focused on the determination of rightful recipients of compensation for deprivation of use introduced by the new Minerals and Mining Act, 2006 (Act 703) in Ghana. Using case study and cross-sectional approaches, expropriated farmers, chiefs, estate valuation surveyors and some officials of Newmont Ghana Gold Ltd involved in the land compensation process were interviewed. The study examined the challenges and processes followed at the Newmont Ghana Gold Ltd Akyem Mining Project, where compensation for deprivation of use of land was applied for the first time in Ghana. The study revealed that the major challenge of compensation revolved around which stakeholders were rightfully entitled to receive compensation for the deprivation of the use of land—allodial owners, usufructs, tenant farmers or sharecroppers. In the absence of any concrete legislative direction, a legislative instrument is needed to clearly define the recipients of compensation under the various possible heads of claim.",Volume 43,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/43/suppl/C,17
"We investigate whether effective corporate governance mechanisms help improve firm-level community engagement activities, using a sample of Australian mining companies for the period 2005–2013. We firstly document that effective board structure and functionality positively contribute to mining companies׳ community engagement. Secondly, we analyze the components of community engagement and examine each of them individually with governance mechanisms. The results show that the effects on engagement with indigenous people and indirect economic are mostly significant and profound. Thirdly, we hypothesize that firm performance proxied by dividend yield can moderate the relationship between governance mechanisms and community engagement. Our empirical results support this hypothesis, suggesting that dividend yield mitigates the negative effects of the largest shareholders ownership and strengthens the positive effects of board size, board meeting and the presence of CSR committee on community engagement level.",Volume 43,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/43/suppl/C,17
"This paper examines neoliberalism coupled with corporate social responsibility (CSR) endeavours in the context of international extractive companies and their implications on the psyche and livelihoods of rural people of developing countries. The inevitability of international capital with neoliberal ideals imposing on sometimes unsuspecting rural social and environmental landscapes of developing countries has become real in recent decades. While international capital is discriminative in its accumulative role via the placating role of CSR in such countries, the hosts, including the governments, sometimes continue to largely miscomprehend the implications of their absorption into a dominant global economy. The paper addresses some of the poignant points of local community livelihood struggles whilst discussing the Lake Kutubu villagers as they host an oil company in their pristine backyards in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The company׳s strategies of CSR and community ‘empowerment’ in the form of a food security programme are critically examined to highlight inherent contradictions embedded in a globalised extractive industry.",Volume 43,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/43/suppl/C,17
"In order to study the global uranium market, a dynamic model for the period 1990–2050 has been developed. It incorporates globally aggregated stocks and flows of uranium moving through the nuclear fuel cycle, as well as a price formation mechanism. Analysis illustrates some of the key features of the market for this commodity, including the role that time lags play in the formation of price volatility. Specific demand reduction and substitution strategies and technologies are explored, and potential external shocks are simulated to investigate the effect on price and how the uranium mining industry responds. Sensitivity analysis of key model parameters indicates that the time constant related to the formation of traders׳ expectations of future market prices embedded in the proposed price discovery mechanism has a strong influence on both the amplitude and frequency of price peaks. Finally, our analysis leads us to believe that the existing uranium resource base will be sufficient to satisfy demand well into the second half of the 21st century.",Volume 43,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/43/suppl/C,17
"The extent to which prices of commodities such as oil and gold affect stock prices of firms engaged in their production, and in the stock market in general, has received attention in both the theoretical and empirical literature with mixed results. Instead of focusing on the direct relation between prices, this paper investigates the relation between different market phases. Specifically, it identifies bull and bear markets in commodity prices and in stock prices of firms whose primary business involves mining and marketing the relevant commodities, and investigates whether a relationship between them exists. The aggregate indices of the sectors related to commodities and the market overall are also considered. The empirical analysis is conducted for the Canadian stock market due to the importance that mining and energy stocks have in its composition. The results suggest that there is little evidence that the market phases identified for the individual stocks are related to those for the commodity prices.",Volume 43,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/43/suppl/C,17
"Rare earth elements are a strategic non-renewable resource. China is the largest producer and exporter of rare earth products. However, China has failed in the past to attain pricing power and large profits in spite of its monopolistic status. Over the past decade, China has issued and readjusted a series of policies for rare earth elements. Did China׳s rare earth export policies work? To answer this question, we have conducted an empirical study using the Lerner index and BP neural network. The results indicate that (1) the market power and price sensitivity of China׳s rare earth products have increased dramatically, indicating that China׳s export policies have exerted significant effects, and (2) the differences and changes in the market power and price sensitivity in different policy periods and in different countries verify the validity of China׳s export restriction policies on rare earth products. Moreover, we suggest that for the sustainable improvement of pricing power, China׳s focus could shift from controlling exports to controlling production, such as carrying out mergers in the industry to form large rare earth producers.",Volume 43,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/43/suppl/C,17
"Geological information can play a key role in addressing challenges of sustainable development such as land degradation and groundwater protection, and contribute to improved decision-making processes. In this paper we: (a) provide a review of previous research on the economic value of geological information and other earth observations as well as related products, services and infrastructure; and (b) identify important lessons from this work as well as methodological challenges that require increased attention in future research. The review of prior research shows significant economic benefits attached to the generation of this type of public information. The value of geological information has typically been measured in terms of avoided costs. Still, it is difficult to compare results across studies since they differ in scope and make alternative assumptions concerning which sectors to cover. Furthermore, previous research is not uniform in their treatment of potential (rather than only existing) users, and employ varying conceptions of avoided costs. The paper concludes that future research should devote more attention to the public and experience good characteristics of this type of information, thus highlighting the preconditions for information adoption as well as addressing the role of potential users. A number of specific methodological challenges also deserve further scrutiny in future research, such as the use of discount rates and benefit-transfer approaches.

"The first decade of the new millennium has ushered in with it booming commodity prices due mainly to high growth in East Asia. Copper prices in particular have soared 80% between 2001 and 2011, causing Chile, the world׳s largest copper producer, to reap massive windfalls. This paper provides an assessment of Chile׳s commodity dependence with a focus on the manner in which current flows of mining revenue promote sustainable development. The first part of the paper suggests Chile׳s status as a strong commodity producer could be complemented by efforts to achieve a more balanced growth trajectory that would include expansion of domestic demand brought about by rising labor productivity and rising wages and reduced dependence on export demand and foreign savings. We believe such an achievement would greatly promote the fair transfer of resource revenue from exhaustible sources to future generations. In the second part of the paper we provide an empirical assessment of sources and the destination of revenue derived from mineral exports. We focus on usage of revenue flows to government, multinationals in the form of profits and operating expenses, and workers. Our approach is intended to provide a more holistic and meaningful assessment of Chile׳s commodity dependence than what is normally found in the literature. We conclude that while the Chilean government clearly has provided future generations with revenue in the form of offshore sovereign wealth funds, most private resource revenue flows offshore in the form of remittances and profits to multinationals. There is limited use of private and public funds directed at enhancing domestic demand through productive investment.",Volume 43,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/43/suppl/C,17
"Although well-endowed with mineral resources, Africa has historically never been able to harvest the developmental benefits from its mineral wealth. The dawn of the 21st century has brought about a new scramble for mineral resources on African soil. China׳s rising wealth levels and the country׳s growing demand for mineral commodities combined with Europe׳s eagerness to maintain its traditional sphere of influence and secure the continent׳s need for resource imports from Africa have added up to an international race for Africa׳s minerals. China has become an attractive business partner to many African countries which sought an alternative to traditional investment approaches. Naturally, China׳s rapid ascent on the African continent has stirred European fears about losing its strategic primacy in Africa. Threatened by the “dragon׳s” seemingly insatiable appetite for Africa׳s mineral resources, the EU has thus increased its effort to secure its hold on the region. In an effort to better understand the effects of the Sino–European scramble for African minerals on the economic prosperity and human development of the world׳s most impoverished continent, the paper analyses Africa׳s opportunities and challenges of the growing competition in the continent׳s minerals sector. While there are grounds to assert that China׳s ascendance in the African minerals sector constitutes a new form of colonialism, there is also reason for the nascent hope that China׳s race for African minerals might change the rules of a game in which Africa has long been the desolate loser and Europe the undisputed winner.",Volume 43,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/43/suppl/C,17
"Mining companies throughout the world often face a high socio-political risk, in particular because of their impact on the environment. A key indicator of exposure to such risk is a company׳s Social License to Operate (SLO). If a company meets its consumer, shareholders and other stakeholders׳ expectations regarding environmental management, it can gain a SLO. The SLO is an implicit contract between parties which reduces the risk of socio-political challenges to the actions of the company. Here, we apply this concept to a case study of the oil and gas sector in Western Australia, where we evaluate the strength of the SLO granted by the West Australian population to this industry. Our results suggest that, on average, people are not likely to oppose oil and gas projects, because they are economically beneficial for the State. However, it does not achieve as high an evaluation on social legitimacy. We subsequently examine whether the use of marine biodiversity offsets by the oil and gas sector influences SLO. This serves to clarify the social acceptability of offsets as tools to protect the environment. We find that the use of marine biodiversity offsets would improve the SLO of the sector.",Volume 43,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/43/suppl/C,17
"This paper investigates to what extent and under what circumstances environmental regulation can be designed and implemented to jointly achieve positive environmental outcomes and sustained competitive strength in the mining industry. First the paper provides a conceptual analysis of the impacts of environmental regulations on mining competitiveness, including a discussion of how the environmental-competitiveness trade-off can be affected by various regulatory design and implementation strategies. Methodologically we distinguish between the flexibility, predictability and stringency of the regulations, and in a second step these analytical concepts are illustrated in the empirical context of the environmental permitting processes in Finland, Sweden and Russia. An important result is that in these countries there has been a lack of timeliness and predictability in the environmental regulations (e.g., uncertainty about the interpretation of the legislation, delays due to appeals etc.). These problems can in part be addressed by, for instance: (a) allocating more resources to the regulatory authorities; (b) establishing more consensus-based regulatory interactions between the mining industry and the authorities; and (c) introducing more standardized procedures and road maps for environmental impact assessments, permit applications and not the least for how to interpret specific legal rules in the context of mining.",Volume 43,March 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/43/suppl/C,17
"After decades of strong economic growth, industrialization and rising living standards, China has become a dominant player in commodity markets. This study attempts to shed light on the role of China in global commodity price dynamics.The empirical analysis applies (Toda and Yamamoto, 1995, J Econom, 66, 225–250) type Granger causality tests and Generalized Impulse Response Functions (GIRF) to examine causal linkages and short-run dynamics between global commodity prices, economic activity, and monetary policy of China from 1998 to 2012.Our results provide evidence that economic activity is Granger causing both energy and industrial metals prices. As for the GIRF analysis, our findings suggest that energy and industrial metals prices respond positively to an increase in the economic activity and that agricultural as well as energy commodity prices overshoot after a drop in the real interest rate of China. We further find evidence that industrial metals prices tend to be higher when China׳s exchange rate system is relaxed.",Volume 42,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/42/suppl/C,18

Futures market finds its place in the price discovery process where the spot market continues to maintain its prominence. We also find evidence indicating that volatility in the spot market has decreased during the post-futures period.

Iran׳s scrap recycling industry, as a major supplier of steel scraps, requires identifying and performing the efficient strategies to utilize the substantial amount of steel scrap. In this research, by designing a model and implementing the efficient strategic factors (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats), via the SWOT analysis, the appropriated strategies, SO, ST, WO and WT are determined. This model consists of four factors, 14 sub-factors and eight strategies. Since the SWOT method is unable to rank the factors and strategies, the MADM technique is applied to prioritize them. The dependency between the factors affects the priority of strategies. Therefore, AHP and ANP methods are applied discretely to examine whether the dependency among the factors changes the priorities of strategies.Comparison of the outcomes from the AHP and ANP methods presents that the dependency among the factors in ANP method causes major changes in ranking the alternatives particularly for the principal alternatives.",Volume 42,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/42/suppl/C,18

It is based on the secondary sources of data extracted from Reserve Bank of India database. The multivariate cointegration technique has been employed to see the long run equilibrium relationship among variables. Further, Granger causality based on vector error correction model (VECM) has been adopted to see both short run and long run causality among the variables. The cointegration results confirm that mineral exports, industrial production and economic growth are cointegrated, indicating an existence of long run equilibrium relationship among variables. Similarly, the VECM Granger causality result holds that there is a long-run Granger causality relationship running from economic growth and industrial production to the mineral export of India.",Volume 42,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/42/suppl/C,18

This approach enables us to determine the basic conditions leading to price relationships. Second, we validate our theoretical findings on monthly metal prices from June 2009 to January 2013. We apply a linear regression model to analyze the price relationships of the primary products and their co-products and finally compare the results of our analysis to our model forecasts.",Volume 42,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/42/suppl/C,18
"There has been considerable interest in, and often criticism of, long distance commuting (LDC), an encompassing term for the fly-in/fly-out (FIFO), drive-in/drive-out (DIDO) and bus-in/bus-out (BIBO) work arrangements utilised by the resources industry that have sustained the mining industry in Australia in recent decades. LDC workers leave their resident community and live away from home in a host community, (usually considerable distance away), returning (typically, several days or weeks later) for furlough. The majority of the academic interest has focused on the impact of LDC on the host community (the community where a person works), individual workers and their families. To date there has been limited focus on how LDC impacts on the resident community (where the LDC worker lives when not working) and where their family usually resides.This paper documents a comprehensive research project which examined the socio-economic implications of long distant commute (LDC) workforce arrangements in the resources sector for two source or resident localities and their communities in regional Australia, (as distinct from the host communities where mines operate). They are distant from mining operations, but now home to significant or growing LDC population cohorts. Focusing on two Western Australian case study sites, the project employed a multi-method, iterative approach to identify and document the size and distribution of the LDC cohort in each case study area, and the associated diverse but interrelated effects and issues. This paper reports that LDC takes considerable personal and community effort to be successful, but there are benefits to be had.",Volume 42,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/42/suppl/C,18
The 2011 peak in rare earth element (REE) prices revealed a vast knowledge gap on the REE-based industry considered to be almost monopolized by Chinese players. A global value chain (GVC) framework is used to provide an understanding of value-adding segments of REE in their transformation from mine to market but inquiries on the currently most-advanced company strategies for alternative REE supplies form the cornerstone of this paper. The Anglo-REE deposit developer strategies are aligned with the value-adding segments and different approaches to integration and co-optation of REE processing competence are uncovered. On this basis the significance of alternative Anglo-REE-developer supplies is discussed and positioned in the perspective of Chinese industrial upgrading.,Volume 42,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/42/suppl/C,18
"The paper analyses the impact of mining on remote statistical local areas (SLAs) in Australia by comparing mining to non-mining SLAs and investigating changes emerging in the two types of SLAs from the resources boom. Specifically, differences are investigated for demographics, industry structure, human capital, income and wealth. Multivariate analyses of variance with main effects for the size of mining industry and interaction effects for census periods are carried out with 197 SLAs. The findings reveal that mining SLAs tend to have larger populations and workforce, fewer Indigenous people and lower unemployment. Mining SLAs have relatively smaller primary and social services sectors but a bigger construction sector. Human capital is greater with more residents having tertiary qualifications and technical occupations in mining SLAs. Incomes are higher and more equitably distributed in mining than non-mining SLAs. These differences widened between 2006 and 2011 during the resource boom.",Volume 42,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/42/suppl/C,18
"Over the decades concerns have been raised about the future availability of certain essential minerals due to increased rates of population growth and advancements in technology. This paper seeks to assess the current state of global mineral supply, focusing mainly on the food and energy technology industries. Through analysis of global mineral production and consumption over a 40-year period we are able to ascertain that, for the industries in question, the increasing global demand is being met by constantly growing mineral reserves.",Volume 42,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/42/suppl/C,18
"In this paper we examine the impact of forward price uncertainty on the optimal cut-off policy of mines. We employ a new real options model for determining the optimal cut-off grade of ore under stochastic prices. The economic insights and consequences of incorporating uncertainty into the cut-off decision making process are shown to be in opposition to that of traditional deterministic cut-off theory. Key among the new insights is that when prices are stochastic, optimal cut-off grades are much lower than those determined using traditional deterministic models that are currently used in practice. This implies that the traditional techniques may lead to greater resource waste than is optimal. This effect is most pronounced for higher volatility metals, marginal mines, higher discount rates and longer valuation time horizons. In addition to the important insights, the new model produces valuations, sensitivities and optimal cut-off strategies that can be used to enhance project valuation, mine operation, hedging strategy determination, mine design and risk management decisions.",Volume 42,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/42/suppl/C,18
"Meeting the demand for mineral commodities is crucial for sustainable development and social welfare. Prospecting and exploration in Poland in the second half of 20th century allowed to discover and demonstrate important resources of various minerals. National economic security regarding the domestic mineral commodities supply is estimated by the mineral static sufficiency coefficient expressed in years. Mineral resources of active mines are estimated to satisfy the demand in the coming years. The estimations vary depending on the resource – lignite resources from currently operating mines will be depleted in 14 years, sand and gravel natural aggregates in 12 years, industrial dolomite in 15 years, ball clays in only 4 years. Zn–Pb ores in active mines are expected to be completely exhausted during the next 3 years. Considerable resources have been identified but are not currently extracted. The minerals may suffice for longer if the yet untapped resources will be exploited. The Polish demand for mineral commodities is only partly satisfied by the domestic supply. Numerous minerals which are not extracted in Poland need to be imported. Extraction of many mineral deposits in Poland is restrained by the actual or planned land use, land property ownership, environment protection exigencies, social opposition and the NIMBY syndrome. Legal regulations can help to solve the conflicts which limit the accessibility of mineral deposits for exploration and exploitation. Legal protection of the areas of known and expected mineral deposits occurrence is necessary.",Volume 42,December 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/42/suppl/C,18
"This study explores expectations for mining from a national perspective. Data were collected from six workshops involving forty-seven participants. Participants were asked what objectives the onshore or offshore mining industry in Australia should achieve. Similar objectives emerged across the workshops, although higher standards were sought for offshore mining compared to onshore mining. Participants wanted mining activity to minimise environmental impacts, look after local communities, keep Australia׳s economy strong, provide employment for Australians, leave an endowment for future generations and maintain Australia׳s international standing. However, participants׳ attitudes and expectations towards the mining industry shifted as the focus of the workshop discussion changed and different social identities became salient. That is, attitudes towards mining appear to vary according to the inter-group context. Thus, to fully understand social expectations for mining it will be necessary to explore the multiple frames of reference that individuals can adopt towards the industry.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"The mining industry is capital intensive, and generally, direct labour employed is low compared to other industries. Considering this, when analysing local economic effects of mining it is important to observe local job multipliers that the industry generates in other sectors of the economy. In this study we use data from the recent Australian mining boom to estimate local job multipliers from mining, using econometric models and avoiding the rigidities and strong assumptions that input–output based models rely on. With census data and samples of Australian sub-state regions, our estimations show that local multipliers of mining are important for some local services sectors such as transport and rental and accommodation services, while local job spillovers into tradable goods sectors (manufacturing and agriculture) are statistically not significant. We also show how the magnitude of local multipliers varies nationwide from those of regions where operating mines are located.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"This paper performs a quantitative analysis of iron ore prices. The analysis will focus on two general issues. First, are prices more volatile before or after the introduction of spot market pricing in 2008/2009? Second, has the change in pricing regime had a significant effect on the iron ore price? The quantitative analysis uses monthly data between January 2003 and August 2012. The overall results show that when including transportation costs to the price series we do not find that iron ore prices are more volatile after the introduction of spot market pricing. Furthermore, the change in pricing regime does not have a significant impact on the iron ore price in the econometric model. Iron ore prices, GDP growth in China, and the freight rates are found to be cointegrated (when regressed with a market dummy variable), and the short run results indicates that GDP growth in China has the strongest impact on the iron ore price series for the period tested.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"Mining is a very important activity for economic and social development, but traditionally research has centered on its technical and operative aspects, instead of studying the image transmitted to the rest of society. This has originated diverse problems, fundamentally due to the information which the population receives via the mass media and which sometimes creates a current of opinion contrary to the development of this extraction activity. In order to resolve the mining communication problems it is necessary to develop a measure of the mining image based on a reliable and valid scale. This is a useful tool in developing a procedure to connect the society with other mining stakeholders and to analyze whether the real image of mining activity is similar to the image transmitted and perceived by society, since the news about the mining industry usually are focused on extreme situations or catastrophes that monopolize the information in the media. In this study a field research based on an attributes scale is developed, with the aim of measuring the mining image. The surveys were carried out in a mining area, where people have direct and real information about the mining industry and its consequences on society, environment and economy.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19

Data for aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, zinc and tin were collected from 1st January, 2009 to 30th June, 2012. Volatility persistence was determined throughout the ARCH/GARCH class of models. The leverage effect was tested using TARCH and EGARCH models. Out of the twelve non-ferrous metals series including both spot and futures, TGARCH captures asymmetric effects in seven series and EGARCH captures leverage effect in ten series. Other long memory features of the data were also examined. Testing fractional integration our results show that the series are I(1) but the squared returns display long memory features.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"We apply linear and non-linear Granger causality tests to four U.S. price indices and 31 commodity series, which expand a 54-year period (January 1957–December 2011). We find evidence of linear Granger causality mostly from individual commodities to price indices. The latter, however, seem to Granger-cause individual commodity prices in a non-linear fashion. Overall, our estimation results show that Agricultural raw materials (cotton, hides, rubber, and wool), Beverages (coffee), Food (maize, rice, and wheat), Minerals, ores and metals (copper), and Vegetable oilseeds and oils (groundnut oil and soybean oil) display bidirectional linear and non-linear feedback effects vis-à-vis price indices.

"The unique properties of rare earth elements (REEs) and lack of alternatives for their application in modern technologies, especially electronics and fast growing green technologies such as renewable energy generation and storage, energy efficient lights, electric cars, and auto catalysts, as well as specific military and aerospace applications, underpin their strategic status.The absolute domination of China in the production of REEs, aggravated by a significant reduction in export quotas since 2010, raised severe concerns of securing REE supply in the USA, Japan, European Union and other countries. In 2010–2012 it resulted in skyrocketing prices and supply deficit for most REEs, leading to numerous new REE start-up companies around the world, with allocation of large investments in additional geological explorations and technology development. At the same time, the supply difficulties enforced the downstream users of REEs to invest in the development of recycling technologies and reuse options for these elements.The main focus of this paper is to overview existing and emerging REE supply chains outside of China up to date (end of 2013), define their environmental constraints and opportunities, as well as reflect on a broader range of technical, economic, and social challenges for both primary production and recycling of REEs. A better understanding of these factors could help to optimize the supply chain of virgin and recycled rare earths, minimise the environmental impacts arising from their processing, and be used as a prototype for a broader range of critical metals and commodities.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"Over this decade unconventional gas has acquired increasing importance due to new techniques that have enabled its large-scale commercial exploration, particularly in the USA. Other countries are evaluating their potential for shale gas exploration. Forecasts point out that the unconventional natural gas resources might represent an increasing share of Brazil׳s energy supply. However, this scenario still faces technological and environmental challenges. This article analyzes whether Brazil׳s gas industry is prepared to develop shale gas, and if there will be water available close to potential unconventional gas resources basins in appropriate volumes and quality, to support fracturing operations. Findings show that Brazil may face challenges to use hydraulic fracturing in the adjacent water basins. The Paraná basin presents the best sites in terms of water availability, followed by the sub-basins within the state of Piaui, where the water demand is low. On the other hand, the water availability in most part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul is critical. The same occurs in the sub-basin and the UGRH located in the state of Minas Gerais. The choice of the wells׳ location must consider the water availability and quality, as indicated in the study.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"This article examines and contrasts the level of Swedish governmental subsidies to two different ways of producing metal: the metal recycling sector and the metal mining sector. In 2010, the metal mining sector was subsidized by € 40 million and the metal recycling sector € 0.6 million. If the exemption from landfill tax is considered a subsidy, the level of subsidization to the metal mining sector changes drastically to approximately € 4000 million. Regardless of how the concept “subsidy” is defined, the metal mining sector in total and per tonne of metal produced is fundamentally more highly subsidized than the metal recycling sector. The value added per tonne of metal produced for the metal recycling sector appears to be higher than for the metal mining sector. The current dominant trend in the Swedish mineral strategy is nevertheless to increase the level of subsidization to the metal mining sector.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"Recent decades have witnessed growing concern among communities, governments and other stakeholders regarding the adverse social and environmental impacts of corporate activity. This concern has generated various interdiscursive notions, such as corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate citizenship, the stakeholder concept, and sustainable development (SD), that purport to enable managers to manage business in a ‘responsible’ or ‘sustainable’ manner. This discursive landscape now commonly includes ‘social licence’ or ‘social licence to operate’, a term that has gained greatest currency in the minerals industry. Literature on social licence is sparse, but encapsulates a diversity of notions such as demands and expectations, legitimacy, credibility, and trust, and free, prior and informed consent. Perhaps most fundamentally, the concept of social licence suggests that stakeholders may threaten a company’s legitimacy and ability to operate through boycotts, picketing, or legal challenges. Yet this interpretation of legitimacy does not mean that stakeholders have the same capacity as regulators to grant or withhold an operation’s right to exist. How, then, do managers within companies under these pressures themselves understand social licence? We present findings of interviews with 16 managers in the minerals industry in Australia. We explore how these managers conceptualise social licence in relation to notions such as legitimacy, approval, and consent, how they interpret processes of social licence in practice, and how they differentiate it from concepts such as CSR. Managers’ conceptualisations can be categorised into four broad themes: legitimacy; localisation; process and continuum; and manageability. These findings suggest that, while social licence potentially represents a shift in power relations, this shift is constrained by discursive pressures to legitimise mining operations, to restrict social licence issues to the local level, to minimise regulatory impositions, to marginalise dissent, and to manage reputation. Opportunities for strengthening and adapting current understandings of social licence are considered.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"׳Free prior and informed consent׳ (FPIC) has emerged as an influential theme in contemporary debates about mining and development. This paper considers the social knowledge base required to actualize the notion of FPIC in particular mining contexts. FPIC introduces heightened social performance requirements at a time where many mining companies are still grappling with the fundamentals of their corporate social responsibilities (CSR). The authors critically review the character of the current FPIC debate as it relates to mining, and outline four conditional factors required to safeguard against social risk. They posit that such risk could be exacerbated by mining companies that fail to comprehensively account for social context and conditionalities. Given the industry׳s broad-based discursive engagement with FPIC, there is an urgent need to extend the current debate beyond legal application and engage with other, equally important, base concepts from the social sciences for the operationalization of FPIC.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"We examine the long term dynamic relation between inflation and the price of gold. We begin by showing that there is no cointegration between gold and inflation if the volatile period of the early 1980s is excluded from the data. However, we are also able to demonstrate that there is significant time variation in the relation, such that comovement between the variables has indeed increased in the last decade. Examination of the underlying macroeconomic factors that could generate time variation in the gold–inflation linkage suggests gold׳s sensitivity to inflation is related to interest rate changes, a finding that highlights the monetary nature of gold as a commodity.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"In their recent article, Tilton et al. (2011, Resour. Policy, 36, 187–195) contend on the basis of conceptual and theoretical arguments that spot and futures prices for metals and other commodities should be closely correlated during periods of strong contango and much less correlated during periods of backwardation or weak contango. If true, this hypothesis implies that speculation and investor demand, most of which takes place on futures markets, should affect spot prices much less or not at all during periods of backwardation or weak contango.This study provides an empirical test of this hypothesis using daily changes in LME average copper prices over the 1994–2011 period. It finds that the correlation coefficients between day-to-day changes in spot and futures prices are quite close to 1 during periods of strong contango. During periods of backwardation and weak contango, the correlations are positive but lower. These findings provide empirical support for the hypothesis advanced by Tilton et al. that investor demand on futures markets affects spot and futures prices similarly when the markets are in strong contango but somewhat less so when they are in weak contango or backwardation.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"The resource curse is a phenomenon regularly evoked in the economic literature on under-development. Given Bolivia׳s low level of GDP per capita and its international insertion based on primary commodity exports, this country is a good candidate for the resource curse. The goal of this paper is to investigate the changes to Bolivia׳s gas policy since 2006 and the evolution of its industry via three aspects: production and inversion, exports, and gas industrialization. In this way we can assess the extent to which policy changes and institutional performance in Bolivia are managing to attenuate some aspects of the resource curse (or not), especially patterns of international insertion. The main conclusion is that the current government has not developed a strategy against the resource curse: instruments to overcome the country׳s productive specialization or primary-export-led international insertion have not been established, and productive linkages have not been encouraged. Instead, the priority of the policy has been to increase State participation in the control (but not the generation) of oil revenues, and significant production changes have not yet been achieved. Ultimately, some aspects of the resource curse have not been attenuated.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"In this article, the problem of environmental and social risk management during the process of colliery liquidation is considered. The identification and assessment of the sources of this risk was conducted on the basis of a review of international case studies and hard coal mining restructuring in Poland from 1993 to 2012. On the basis of conclusions from the analyses, basic assumptions were elaborated concerning the conception of environmental and social risk management during the process of colliery liquidation. Such a conception is based on including the sustainable development and corporate social responsibility in the total system of risk management in a mining enterprise. The approach presented in the article – considering the scale and extent of social and environmental effects of colliery liquidation – makes the internal decision-makers, as well as external stakeholders, aware of the necessity of undertaking anticipatory activities aimed at the reduction of social and environmental risks and effects during colliery liquidation.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"This study investigates cointegrating relationship between gold import demand, gold price and GDP for Indian economy during the period Q1’ 1998–1999 to Q3’ 2012–2013. It also estimates short-run and long-run elasticities of gold import demand with respect to gold price and GDP. Johansen–Juselius, ARDL bounds test and threshold cointegration tests suggest cointegrating relationship among the variables. Gold import demand is found to be moderately inelastic to unitary elastic with respect to gold price in the long-run with income elasticity being highly elastic suggesting that gold is a luxury commodity. In the short-run, however, gold demand demonstrates high elasticity with respect to its price. Granger causality shows that gold import demand causes an impact on the price of gold in the short-run, though in the long-run income and price have impacts on the demand for gold import. The result of the study is highly insightful and has many vital implications for the Indian economy and its economic policies. The findings suggest that regular hikes in custom duties on gold import may bring temporary relief to control gold import demand and the stress on current account deficit. Hence, financial inclusion along with the creation of simple but lucrative financial products and educating people about those products may lead to a long-term respite from the depletion of foreign exchange reserves significantly by creating an investment substitute of gold.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"Commentators have usually viewed potash as a rather unglamorous commodity because of its limited applications, low prices, the relatively small size of the industry, a persistent supply overhang situation and high barriers to entry. Yet on closer inspection, potash provides an interesting mineral market case study.Recently the industry has been operated as a cartel coordinated by two exporting companies—Canpotex in North America (owned by PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic) and the Belarusian Potash Company in the Former Soviet Union (owned by Uralkali and Belaruskali). The sector attracted new interest after 2007 when world potash prices more than doubled and the prospect of more rapidly growing demand emerged as oil and gas prices surged. Two notable recent developments have been the unsuccessful effort by BHP Billiton to acquire PotashCorp in 2010, and the attempt by Uralkali in late 2013 to increase its market share by withdrawing from its marketing agreement with Belruskali, which now seems to have been thwarted.Considering the demand and supply sides of the industry, the current paper reflects on its recent evolution and assesses likely developments in the coming decades.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19

These issues have yet to be explored in depth, perhaps due to the relative ‘newness’ of the country׳s Environmental Governance agenda. Drawing on findings from research conducted in Sierra Leone between January and July 2011, the paper critically assesses three key components of the country׳s Environmental Governance agenda: the Mines and Minerals Act of 2009, specifically, its ability to address issues concerning the loss of property rights, compensation and resettlement; the efficacy of Environmental Impact Assessment as an environmental regulatory and management tool; and the capacity of the Environmental Protection Agency. The lack of sufficient progress being made on these three areas is largely a result of overreliance on a strategy that is neoliberal in character and which, therefore, fails to prioritise environmental concerns.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19
"Mineral extraction makes an essential contribution to national development and prosperity. However, unlike many other land uses, the location of sites where mineral extraction can take place is limited. The underlying geology dictates where mineral resources occur and other factors, such as economics, environmental considerations, surface land use or technology can limit access. To ensure a continued, steady and adequate supply of the raw materials needed by society, it is important that mineral resources are not needlessly sterilised by new, non-mineral related, development. Although this principle has been part of the UK planning process since the Town and Country Planning Act was introduced in 1947, the mechanisms and policies in place to support it were, until recently, largely ineffective. A more robust mechanism was, therefore, required.In recent years, mineral policy has been revised by the UK government and a process known as ‘mineral safeguarding’ has been introduced and applied through the UK planning system within the devolved jurisdictions. Efforts undertaken so far focus on the safeguarding of onshore construction minerals, industrial minerals and coal largely because of the importance of their indigenous production. However, more recently the concept of mineral safeguarding is being applied to offshore aggregates. This paper describes how mineral safeguarding has been implemented in the UK. A number of case studies highlight different aspects of the mineral safeguarding process which, when applied and enforced, enables mineral resources to be appropriately considered within the land use planning process.",Volume 41,September 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/41/suppl/C,19

"This paper identifies how organisational field dynamics have changed over time within the field of business and development. Using the extractive industries as the empirical setting, development agency policy documents and corporate reports are analysed in order to identify convergence and divergence of discourses and changing institutional logics. The business-development organisational field became structured around a new variant of development managerialism in the early 2000s. Business became recognised as a core partner in devising and implementing market-driven development solutions. Thus, the logic of partnership for economic growth dominated this time period. In the late 2000s a divergence in the business and development organisational field is identified. Attempts by UNDP and other international organisations to temper market-driven development have given rise to the logic of good governance whereas the logic of partnership for development continues to drive that of the extractive industries. It will be interesting to explore in the future how these organisational fields compete or self-reinforce over time. The field of business and development, dominated by development managerialism, could become more fragmented or could move towards convergence and restructuration.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"This article critically examines the impact, up until 2009, of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The EITI is an international policy intervention that aims to mitigate the negative effects of resource abundance by promoting the transparency of resource revenues and accountability of the governments of resource rich states. Its effectiveness can be assessed by examining two outcomes that are suggested to be negatively affected by resource abundance: economic development and quality of governance. Through a panel study, including approximately 200 countries, the influence of the EITI in these two areas is examined. Results suggest that the negative effect of resource abundance on GDP per capita, the capacity of the government to formulate and implement sound policies and the level of rule of law is mitigated in EITI countries. However, the EITI has little effect on level of democracy, political stability and corruption. The study concludes that there are some early indications that the EITI has been successful in protecting some nations from selected elements of the resource curse. This is encouraging given the relatively short time period since the founding of the EITI, however the mixed results suggest that a similar study should be repeated in 5 to 10 years when EITI policies have had enough time to fully take effect.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"This article critically explores the nature and purpose of relationships and interdependencies between stakeholders in the context of a parastatal chromite mining company in the Betsiboka Region of Northern Madagascar. An examination of the institutional arrangements at the interface between the mining company and local communities identified power hierarchies and dependencies in the context of a dominant paternalistic environment. The interactions, inter alia, limited social cohesion and intensified the fragility and weakness of community representation, which was further influenced by ethnic hierarchies between the varied community groups; namely, indigenous communities and migrants to the area from different ethnic groups.Moreover, dependencies and nepotism, which may exist at all institutional levels, can create civil society stakeholder representatives who are unrepresentative of the society they are intended to represent. Similarly, a lack of horizontal and vertical trust and reciprocity inherent in Malagasy society engenders a culture of low expectations regarding transparency and accountability, which further catalyses a cycle of nepotism and elite rent-seeking behaviour. On the other hand, leaders retain power with minimal vertical delegation or decentralisation of authority among levels of government and limit opportunities to benefit the elite, perpetuating rent-seeking behaviour within the privileged minority. Within the union movement, pluralism and the associated politicisation of individual unions restrict solidarity, which impacts on the movement's capacity to act as a cohesive body of opinion and opposition. Nevertheless, the unions' drive to improve their social capital has increased expectations of transparency and accountability, resulting in demands for greater engagement in decision-making processes.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"On March 17, 2003, Olusegun Obasanjo, then the Nigerian President performed a groundbreaking ceremony to signal the commercial mining of bitumen under a neoliberal resource governance framework. This ceremony marks an important threshold in the history of bitumen development in Nigeria. Ever since bitumen, also known as heavy oil or tarsand, was discovered in 1900 (GCU, 1980: 10), attempts towards developing it have been undermined by political and socioeconomic challenges that persist within the bitumen bearing region (henceforth, Bitumen Belt), and a problematic governance framework. However, the Nigerian federal government׳s decision to adopt a neoliberal mining strategy towards bitumen extraction opened a new frontier in the discourse on resource governance and the socio-economic development of resource endowed communities in Nigeria. This paper explores the connection between the bitumen governance regime and the community development challenges of the bitumen belt. In doing so, the paper explores the contradictions inherent in the use of a neoliberal mining framework for resource extraction in a rentier capitalist economy like Nigeria and its implications for community development. It argues that the underlying issues of concern to bitumen bearing communities must be captured in the resource governance framework in order to ensure its sustainability and acceptance.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"Resource governance norms have evolved at multiple scales to counter the potential negative socio-economic, environmental and institutional impacts of the extractive industries. Advocates of these ‘good governance’ initiatives have sought to mainstream transparency throughout the extractive industries value chain and implement pro-poor projects at the site level. However, these types of resource governance interventions often fall short of their promised development benefits. Poorly understood is how the process of resource extraction and the expectation of supposed revenue windfalls affect the governance dynamics of host countries and localities. Using a qualitative and inductive approach this paper highlights emerging spaces of governance within a new petro-state, Uganda. The research findings highlight four significant governance gaps: lack of coherence among civil society organisations (CSOs); limited civil society access to communities and the deliberate centralisation of oil governance; industry-driven interaction at the local level; and weak local government capacity. The ad hoc and fragmented modes of resource governance in the oil bearing regions, particularly related to transparency and corporate social responsibility activities, do not bode well for this new petro-state’s development trajectory. By identifying how spaces of resource governance emerge in new resource contexts, more proactive and timely interventions can be designed and implemented by state and non-state actors.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"This article explores the different manifestations of violence in the gold-producing region of Tanzania, drawing on findings from empirical research. In doing so, it illustrates how the gold mining sector in Tanzania, despite being associated with contestation and ongoing violence, has continued to produce at a high level. The article calls for a broadening of the definition of “violence” within resource-rich regions in order to account for significant environmental and non-physical forms of violence that occur over broad temporal scales, or what is referred to as “slow violence”. This would allow for a closer examination of the range of effects on communities and the environment at sites of extraction, including the impacts on human rights defenders, the focus of this analysis. The aim is to extend understanding of violence beyond extreme acts and rather to account for a more extensive range of manifestations across resource-rich regions of Tanzania.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"In 2007, Ghana joined the club of Gulf of Guinea oil-rich countries when transnational corporations discovered proven reserves in the Jubilee Field, off of the Cape Three Points along its Western coast. This has generated debate on whether Ghana would escape the resource curse. The orthodox resource curse approach (ORCA), dominant in most discussions on the issue to date, offers some valuable theoretical and policy insights but is also highly problematic: it is uncritical, ahistorical and reductionist. Fixated on internal political and economic factors, the ORCA ignores the longue durée of capitalist exploitation and its negative structural effects on the economy. This article formulates a critical political economy approach (PEA) which brings a fresh perspective on the oil-curse debate, focusing specifically on the case of Ghana. Using theoretical argumentation and empirical evidence, the paper explains why, in the context of ORCA, many would argue that a liberal democratic context, relatively good governance and long history of gold mining will help Ghana minimise the probability of a resource curse. But when analysed using a more dynamic PEA, it becomes clear that the danger of a resource curse ‘epidemic’ surfacing in Ghana is very real: the continuous exploitation by global capital, which has perpetuated the existence of enclave extractive industries and a dependence on the export of low-value commodities. A PEA brings into sharper focus the global political economy underpinnings of the resource curse in Sub-Saharan Africa by highlighting the way in which the dynamics of ‘uneven and combined’ capitalist development have conditioned the region, both resource-rich and poor, to become dependent on the production and export of raw commodities.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"While many African countries do not have a strong track record of managing mineral wealth well, Ghana is often considered a model of best practice, based on the government׳s distribution of a proportion of mining rents to mining affected communities. However, corruption and mismanagement by local authorities and traditional leaders undermine this policy. The paper considers the policy implications, arguing that the usual remedies promoted by the development community of transparency and social accountability are unlikely to be effective. An alternative policy is gaining more international support, which involves using the wealth from natural resource sectors to fund a universal cash transfer scheme. The paper considers the feasibility and potential benefits of this in Ghana, not only in terms of improving the developmental contribution of mineral wealth, but also how a cash transfer scheme may overcome corruption and poor governance.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is often characterised as rush-type activity undertaken by people looking to ‘get-rich quick’. An alternative view posits ASM as poverty-driven activity which provides a valuable source of employment to a rural population where agriculture has failed to provide an adequate income. Against this dichotomy, this article critically reviews the short-lived, but high profile, gold rush which occurred on the beaches of Elmina, a fishing town in Ghana's Central Region. At its peak, more than 1000 people, including local fishermen and career miners from the Western Region and Eastern Region of the country, were mining on the beaches. Drawing on interviews with miners and local business owners, the analysis explores the dynamics of the rush and its implications for understanding the ASM sector in Ghana. The discussion highlights the challenges associated with managing resources in dynamic and heterogeneous contexts, reconciling separate and conflicting sectoral priorities and the need to go beyond simplified and dualistic representations of the sector.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"This article reports on an empirical study of the relationship between artisanal and industrial mining at the Twangiza gold concession in South Kivu Province, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The setting is a post-conflict context where artisanal mining activities have supported livelihoods for several decades, but where the arrival of a multinational company, with explicit backing from the national government, has caused dispossession and displacement and altered local power relations, leaving former artisanal miners with few alternatives for making a living. Although Congolese law recognizes artisanal mining and policies have been proposed to formalize and support this sector, reality is often very different and artisanal miners frequently clash with industrial enterprises. This article argues that, in order to understand the dynamics underlying these clashes, closer attention needs to be paid to the practices and discourses of the artisanal miners themselves: how do they conceptualize notions such as property, legitimacy and livelihood, and what is their outlook on development? The empirical analysis shows how miners in Twangiza resist dispossession by the multinational corporation in both words and actions.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"The debate on conflict minerals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been widely documented by the international media, government and non-governmental agencies and academics. In recent years, a variety of international initiatives have been launched to curb the flow of funding from conflict minerals to armed groups. Many of these initiatives, however, have led to the loss of livelihoods for millions of small-scale miners.Drawing on interviews with key informants and focus group discussions in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) communities in South Kivu Province of the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), this paper examines the ways in which the national army, as well as an array of armed groups, have exerted control of mining towns. Findings reveal a number of ways that mining has shown itself to be “better adapted” to an unstable context than traditional agricultural models, resulting in the continued development of this sector even during conflict. Constant displacement, the fear of violence, inability to travel safely, and the disintegration of agricultural markets have all contributed to the decline of previous forms of income generation. With its promise of cash-in-hand, low start-up costs, and low demand for specialized knowledge, ASM provides a more viable employment opportunity to youth than farming. Finally, findings from this work suggest that, with components of both “distress-push” as well as “rush-type” motivations, the system could be characterized as third hybrid model: a “distress-rush” process. In this system, exploitation of minerals became increasingly entrenched as a primary source of income, and along the way shaped social, economic, and political structures. A better understanding of the political economies of ASM communities and the challenges miners face on a daily basis would increase the impact and effectiveness of initiatives aimed at curbing conflict and bolstering economic growth in the region.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"Artisanal mining is a key source of livelihood in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, an area mostly known for its chronic instability and violent conflict. Although men make up the majority of the artisanal mining population, mining is also central in the livelihoods of many girls and women. In this paper, we take issue with the fact that the current emphasis on conflict-related sexual violence to women has obscured the role of women in artisanal mining. Furthermore, we criticize the tendency to promote women's departure from the mining sector, which has been presented as the best strategy to protect them against the threats of sexual violence, exploitation and oppression. We argue that, given the lack of viable alternative livelihoods in eastern DRC, policymakers should invest more time, energy and resources in trying to understand and to strengthen women's positions in the mining sector itself.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"Drawing on ethnographic research and problem-centered interviews in Guinean mining areas, this paper presents a comparative reading of the conflicting conceptions of what constitutes a “mining community.” First, I explore how independent artisanal miners describe and identify their activity. The weight of autochthony conventions is discussed concerning their insertion both in the mining fields and in their living locations. Second, I focus the case study on how the corporate social responsibility (CSR) interventions toward the mining community, commissioned by a gold mining company in Guinea, are interpreted by the artisanal miners. The analysis of the deployed discourses and related interventions delineate what is defined as the mining community in CSR programs, and how these interventions shape new understandings of the company׳s territory among the miners.Using a boundary work approach, the paper shows how CSR interventions symbolically transpose the spatial concession border into symbolic and social boundaries among the artisanal mineworkers. CSR discourses and interventions transform “trespassers” into “foreigners”, as opposed to “natives”, who are often viewed as “traditional sedentary workers” by the mining company. In doing this, CSR programs reinforce and standardize autochthony-based relations, and extend autochthony boundaries in all segments of the gold mining socio-technical system. The attachment of these initially separated categories creates an idealized figure of “traditional” artisanal mining, while also stigmatizing the itinerant artisanal miners. As a consequence, I will discuss the emergence of conflict situations regarding access to mining spaces and resources within the surrounding villages.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20

Through an analysis of Fairtrade Gold in Tanzania, this paper argues that despite Fairtrade׳s promises to ASM operators of better prices, its potential efficacy is compromised by the informality of local gold markets and a deeply-rooted mistrust of development intervention more broadly. However, its greatest contribution may lie elsewhere in the drive for a social and environmental justice framework that privileges increased recognition for small-scale gold miners in the global South.","Volume 40, Pages 1-136 (June 2014)",June 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/40/suppl/C,20
"Companies involved in the minerals industry have been exposed to operating in more than one geographical jurisdiction for over a century. This practice has been amplified in recent decades by globalisation of the world economy. Cross-jurisdictional exposure has required that the way information on mineral assets is reported in the public domain or as industry best practice be standardised in order to provide a common understanding, irrespective of regulatory jurisdiction. Accordingly, a global committee known as the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO) was formed in 1994 to align national minerals reporting codes. CRIRSCO initially published a template in 2006 and updated it in May 2013 to align the national mineral reporting codes. The template fosters a common understanding by harmonising the definitions, classification, estimation processes and the public reporting of exploration results, mineral resources and mineral reserves. The standardisation of minerals reporting codes is a foundation from which inputs to subsequent valuations are defined. However, despite the various national valuation codes having adequate high-level commonality on some principles, valuation approaches, competence and application of these codes, there are differences that arise in the areas of definitions, some principles and scope that require alignment. Consequently, the International Mineral Valuation Committee (IMVAL) was formed in 2012 in Australia, primarily to develop a globally acceptable mineral asset valuation (MAV) template by harmonising the valuation codes. This paper contributes to the development of such a template by providing a plausible framework for its development. The framework is premised on a skeletal structure that initially encompasses only high-level commonality among the major valuation codes, while allowing jurisdiction-specific requirements to be addressed at the national level. There is flexibility for the template to evolve over time to include aspects not initially addressed, such as valuation of mineral corporations and their respective securities, and valuation of oil and gas assets.",Volume 39,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/39/suppl/C,21
"Dysprosium (Dy) is a strategic rare-earth element with many uses in modern technology and an extremely limited supply. We compared the effectiveness of two different strategies for reducing total demand for Dy in Japan during the period 2010–2030: development of low-Dy REE (NdFeB) magnets and a program to promote recycling of REE magnets. First we performed a substance flow analysis based on a bottom-up estimation of the Dy inventory in Japan. This enabled us to construct a data set for the forecasts of future demand that could be used to model the outcome of strategies for Dy demand at each stage of Dy flow. For the low-Dy magnet development scenario, the reduction in the proportion of Dy in NdFeB magnets ranged from 0.8% to 5% in end-use products. On that of recycling promotion, recycling rates of end-use products ranged from 5% to 30% over the years. A baseline forecast of Dy demand was made using historical data. We found that the strategy of low-Dy magnet development would be much more effective in reducing Dy demand than recycling promotion.However, to help ensure a sustainable Dy supply in the long term, both strategies should be pursued in a balanced approach.",Volume 39,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/39/suppl/C,21
"In contrast to energy and precious metals commodities, relatively little is known about the volatility dynamics of base (or industrial) metals commodities. To address this deficiency, this paper employs a multivariate heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model to consider the volatility spillovers between the five of the most liquid and important non-ferrous metals contracts (aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc) traded on the London Metal Exchange using intraday data over the period June 2006–December 2012. This period encompasses both the surge in commodities prices associated with the burgeoning industrial demand of many emerging economies, especially China, resulting in market peaks in May 2007 and April 2008 and the subsequent negative reaction of base metals markets to the collapse of stock markets during the recent global financial crisis. The results show that the volatility series of other industrial metals appear to contain useful incremental information for future price volatility. However, the own dynamics are often sufficient for describing most future daily and weekly volatility, with the most pronounced volatility spillovers identified in the longer term. Combined together, the results in this study provide useful findings for exporter and importer countries dealing with the continuing volatility in these industrially important commodity markets.",Volume 39,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/39/suppl/C,21
"Metal price forecasts support estimates of future profits from metal exploration and mining and inform purchasing, selling and other day-to-day activities in the metals industry. Past research has shown that cyclical behaviour is a dominant characteristic of metal prices. Wavelet analysis enables to capture this cyclicality by decomposing a time series into its frequency and time domain. This study assesses the usefulness of an improved combined wavelet-autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach for forecasting monthly prices of aluminium, copper, lead and zinc. The performance of ARIMA models in forecasting metal prices is demonstrated to be increased substantially through a wavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA) prior to ARIMA model fitting. The approach demonstrated in this paper is novel because it identifies the optimal combination of the wavelet transform type, wavelet function and the number of decomposition levels used in the MRA and thereby increases the forecast accuracy significantly. The results showed that, on average, the proposed framework has the potential to increase the accuracy of one month ahead forecasts by $53/t for aluminium, $126/t for copper, $50/t for lead and $51/t for zinc, relative to classic ARIMA models. This highlights the importance of taking into account cyclicality when forecasting metal prices.",Volume 39,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/39/suppl/C,21
"The ability to identify and foster innovative solutions to complex challenges is critically important in regional Australia, and particularly so in ‘resource regions’. This paper explores the role for innovation in delivering regional outcomes across the social, economic and environmental domains. It describes the value of regional innovation strategies in assessing regional assets, challenges and emerging opportunities, through a case study focus on Central Queensland. This region is one of Australia's key resource hubs, which benefits from the economic activity linked with extractive, transport and processing industries, but also experiences a range of adverse social and environmental effects. Awareness of innovation systems and innovative practices allows regional development practitioners, as well as the mining industry itself, to re-frame issues and opportunities beyond current drivers, development paradigms and planning horizons.

"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of a sample of sixty-two precious metal mutual funds by applying a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to measure the relative efficiency of funds. In the second stage, a Tobit model is employed to identify the drivers of performance. The purpose for and intended contribution of this paper is twofold: to provide consolidated measures of relative performance of precious metal mutual funds using for first time the DEA framework and to explain fund performance by employing a Tobit model. Correlation results among DEA-based performance measures and traditional indicators of fund performance (Sharpe ratio and Jensen's α) are mixed; no correlation has been found for the Sharpe ratio; whereas in the case of Jensen's α, the correlation is not high. Moreover, the mean-variance efficiency hypothesis holds for the inefficient funds of the sample.

"We propose that to understand how a social licence to operate in mining is granted and maintained, we need to take account of the processes mining companies use to engage with local communities. The present research measured and modelled the critical elements of social licence by conducting a longitudinal study in an Australian mining region. The results of path analyses showed that building trust with local communities was crucial for mining companies to obtain and maintain a social licence to operate. The mining operation's negative impacts on social infrastructure, community members' perceived contact quality and procedural fairness in dealing with company personnel significantly affected the community's acceptance of the mining operation through inferred trustworthiness of the company. Our results highlight the importance of fair treatment and high-quality engagement of mining companies with communities, alongside mitigation of operational impacts, in securing and holding a social licence to operate.",Volume 39,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/39/suppl/C,21
"Our research investigates the impact of a major resource boom on income inequality within Kazakhstan's regions using household-level data across the entire income distribution and within the top and bottom halves of the income distribution. In addition, we evaluate the inequality dynamics separately in urban and rural areas. The theoretical foundation shows that a resource boom will decrease income inequality through the labor market if the non-traded sector is relatively intensive in its use of unskilled labor. Government transfers financed by resource income can further reduce inequality. Our regression analysis indicates that resource booms lower inequality when we control for the effect of changing labor income, institutional quality, education levels, and public health care spending. In addition, quality of institutions is an important equalizing factor for the lower income households in urban areas, but not in rural areas. Public health programs decrease overall inequality in the rural areas; however, they do not affect the bottom half of the income distribution.",Volume 39,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/39/suppl/C,21

"This paper presents an environmental policy model with heterogeneous firms to analyze the problem of “development–pollution”. The model shows how the policy corresponding to firms' productivity affects total output, resource consumption and pollution emission. We find that with the implementation of simple pollution tax, the lowest productive firms will exit from the market, at the same time total resource consumption and pollution emission will decrease at the loss of total output. The loss in total output leads some economies, especially the developing countries to fall into a development dilemma. However, if government subsidizes the more productive firms by reallocating tax revenue, total output will increase back to “ex-tax” situation. And more importantly, resource consumption and pollution emission in production could be below “ex-tax” situation. Our main finding are: (1) environmental policy reduces resource consumption and pollution emission; (2) total output could be maintained at a certain level if environmental policy is implemented appropriately.",Volume 39,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/39/suppl/C,21

"Mining boom has created various impacts in the regions of Queensland, Australia. However, it is not clear how to increase positive impacts from mining within the regions. Mining industry may be the dominant industry in the local community and in the region in terms of providing local employment and generating income; it does not necessarily have direct linkages to the local economy and therefore does not contribute fully to diversified sustainable development of the local community or the region.

"Commodity price is an important factor for mining companies, as price volatility is a key parameter for mining project evaluation and investment decision making. The conventional discounted cash flow (DCF) methods are broadly used for mining project valuations, however, based on commodity price uncertainty and operational flexibilities, it is difficult and often inappropriate to determine mining project values through traditional DCF methods alone. In order to more accurately evaluate the economic viability of a mining project, the commodity price and its inherent volatility should be modelled appropriately and incorporated into the evaluation process. As a consequence, researchers and practitioners continue to develop and introduce real options valuation (ROV) methods for mining project evaluations under commodity price uncertainty, incorporating continuous time stochastic models. Although the concept of ROV arose a few decades ago, most of the models that have been developed to-date are generally limited to theoretical research and academia and consequently, the application of ROV methods remains poorly understood and often not used in mining project valuations. Analytical and numerical solutions derived through the application of ROV methods are rarely found in practice due to the complexity associated with solving the partial differential equations (PDE), which are dependent on several conditions and parameters. As a consequence, it may not generally be applicable to evaluate mining projects under all project-specific circumstances. Therefore, the greatest challenge to ROV modelling is in finding numerically explicit project values. This paper contributes towards the further development of known theoretical work and enhances an approach to approximating explicit numerical project values. Based on this work, it is possible to formulate more complex PDEs under additional uncertainties attached to the project and to approximate its numerical value or value ranges. To ensure the project is profitable and to reduce commodity price uncertainty, delta hedging and futures contracts have been used as options for deriving the PDE. Moreover, a new parameter for taxes has been incorporated within the PDE. This new PDE has been utilised to approximate the numerical values of a mining project considering a hypothetical gold mine as a case study. The explicit finite difference method (FDM) and MatLab software have been used and implemented to solve this PDE and to determine the numerical project values considering the available options associated with a mining project. In addition, commodity price volatility has been determined from historical data, and has again revealed price volatility as having a significant impact on mining project values.",Volume 39,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/39/suppl/C,21
"Nowadays, economic uncertainties have an indispensable role in mining evaluation projects, so the evaluation of a mining project without considering if the available uncertainties are incorrect and unreliable. Metal price uncertainty and operating costs uncertainty are the most important parameters in economic uncertainty. Numerous research studies have been carried out for price uncertainty, but there is no noticeable research on the simultaneous effects of operating cost and price uncertainties on the evaluation process. To solve this problem, a new evaluation method – pyramid technique – was developed based on the multidimensional binomial tree method. The pyramid technique can evaluate the mining projects under the situation of multi-uncertainties.In this research, in order to determine the efficiency of the pyramid technique, the net present value of the Grasberg copper mine was computed under economic uncertainties. Finally, the achieved results were compared with the results of the other evaluation methods such as binomial tree. It is concluded that when uncertainties are considered by the pyramid method, the mine evaluation suggests more reliable net present value.",Volume 39,March 2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/39/suppl/C,21
"Considering the past few years rapid increase in the demand for minerals and metals, mainly stemming from the strong economic growth in China and India, an understanding of the historical development of steel demand is of importance. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the trends and developments of steel consumption in the world by applying the so-called Intensity-of-Use (IoU) method. The empirical analysis is performed using steel consumption and GDP (in constant 2005 US Dollars) data for 61 countries over 42 years. The results show that the IoU hypothesis does not hold for the whole panel, but when dividing the sample into three income groups we find that the IoU hypothesis holds for the Middle income group, indicating that the countries in this income group have experienced the move from an industrialization phase towards a more service based economy in the time period investigated. However, when taking into account time series properties and applying panel unit root tests, the variables are confirmed as non-stationary. A panel cointegration test shows further that the variables are cointegrated, and an ECM model has been performed to test the IoU hypothesis. The results confirm that the IoU hypothesis holds for the Middle income group. Regarding the estimated turning point this is identified at a GDP per capita level of about 19,000 US. There are thus many countries that are far from the level of GDP per capita when steel IoU starts to decline.

Mineral resources represent an integral component within a country’s economy. Despite the fact that the need for raw materials undergoes continuous growth–especially in countries which experience industrial upswing–proper measures to secure the access to domestic mineral resources in the long term have only been applied marginally in a large number of states. This lack of future-oriented legal frameworks–referred to as ‘Minerals Policies’–might lead to a diversity of sectoral problems (eg. dependency on certain raw materials imports). Based on data analysis and subsequent demand forecasting comprehensive national Minerals Policies can be derived in order to anticipate emerging issues and to achieve optimum sustainable management of domestic geological resources. The necessity of such concepts is illustrated by the example of Romania focusing on non-energetic mineral resources.,"Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"The objective of this article is to understand how the promotion of clusters of small economic agents in the gem sector has brought some improvements in the economic, social and environmental conditions in the mining sector and activities related to it. The research provides policy and theoretical contributions to the field of gem production, as well as enhances understanding of the under researched opal production in Brazil. It argues that government funding and technical support dedicated to the development of mining clusters, i.e. working with small economic agents as a whole and not individually, could promote not only more economic development, but also effectively incorporate social and environmental issues, such as workers safety, water management and tailings recycling. The argument is based on an evaluation of environmental, economic, social and institutional aspects of the opal mining cluster in Pedro II municipality, Piauí state. The results suggest that some formalisation of existing practices and adequate policies have triggered innovation with some positive effects on the performance of artisanal mining. Nevertheless, there are indications that if decision-makers plan to make this cluster more sustainable, they will have to include other issues in the debate including developing substituting economic activities.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"Some strategic raw materials do have an extremely unsecure supply situation. Several working groups around the world have made criticality assessments for metallic raw materials to analyze the driving impact factors for this instability. However, the influences on raw material availability are manifold and therefore criticality assessment methods are very heterogeneous. Here we give an overview about the differences and similarities of supply risk evaluation in 15 criticality assessment methods. We take the example of Indium, which has been rated in 60% of these criticality studies, and show which data base is used for supply risk evaluation. Our results show a lack of consensus about which indicators give reliable information for raw material supply risk and how these indicators should be aggregated.

The goal of this study is to analyze the economic and social effects of various mineral developments in China from diversified perspectives, so as to provide the basis for the formulation of China's mineral development policy. The input–output effects, industrial linkage effects and income distribution effects of different mining industries are quantitatively analyzed by adopting basic hypotheses of input–output economics, industrial linkage model and income distribution antitheses based on the latest available official data from China Statistical Yearbook from 2004 to 2010 and the 2007 Input–Output Table of China. The empirical results obtained in this study indicate that all mineral development industries, especially coal mining and washing, and petroleum and natural gas extraction industries, have given a strong impetus to the increase of China's fixed asset investment and GDP. Moreover, they have provided a large number of jobs, thereby alleviating ongoing employment pressure, and they have also played a positive role in promoting China's technology investment. The analysis of industrial linkages demonstrates that mining industries are basic to the national economy and produce a significant impetus to its downstream industries, but create weak pull effects in terms of national economic development. From the perspective of income distribution, mining industries play an important role in increasing China's fiscal revenue and per capital income. Hence, China's mineral development policy should (1) encourage additional investment in technology for exploration and development to insure sufficient supply and expand the input effects; (2) attract additional talent to work in remote regions; (3) optimize the industrial structure and promote the industrial transformation in resource regions; (4) adjust the interest distribution between the central and local governments to enable the local regions to become more self-sufficient; and (5) enhance the legal environment so that companies can more readily undertake their social responsibilities voluntarily.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"The primary goal of the paper is to show the validity of investing capital in fertilizer–mining companies, both from a market return perspective for individual or institutional investors, or from a hedging standpoint for insurance companies and other economic actors exposed to inflation risk and high agricultural commodity prices. After providing some elements on the fertilizer market and describing the joint dynamics of corn, wheat and fertilizer prices over the last decade, we analyze an exhaustive sample of listed fertilizer producing companies over the years January 2004–December 2012. We show that their shares generated quite good returns over the whole period and extremely high ones during the years January 2004–December 2007, both in absolute terms and compared to their betas. We also exhibit that these returns display higher sensitivities to major agricultural indexes than to the World Bank Fertilizer Index, making the hedging argument quite compelling.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"The resources sector in Australia makes a major contribution to the national economy, and underpins employment and population in the mining and mineral processing towns. For those towns, rapid growth in employment can generate particular pressures in local housing markets because of the relatively large size of the industry and the small housing stocks involved. Through a case study of Gladstone, the study provides a dynamic five-step population and housing model, to estimate short to medium term mining impacts of major resource developments. The model includes both the direct and indirect labour force generated by new resource sector developments and their flow-on effects on population increases. Sensitivity testing has allowed for different levels of resource development, employment multipliers and labour inflows. Three different approaches have then been applied to predict the housing price impacts of the expected population growth.The results of the study show that the model can efficiently predict population and housing market dynamics where there is a resource boom and bust cycle, and can potentially be applied to other resource regions in Australia and elsewhere.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"This study presents a probabilistic approach to the assessment of mineral deposits availability. This approach takes into account the joint influence of decision making involving deposits in development and the difficulty in formalizing socio-economic factors. Using this approach, we designed a model for estimating the availability of deposits with regard to the influence of the length of time elapsed prior to beginning development; values for copper deposits in Russia, the USA and Canada were calculated. The characteristics of mineral resources are determined by an experimental method for these countries. These characteristics are defined by periods when the time factor has a positive influence on deposit availability.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"The group of elements known as the rare earth elements (REEs) is comprised of the 15 lanthanides. REEs are used in a number of technologies including catalysts for automobiles and petroleum refining, magnets for wind turbines and defense technologies, and phosphors in lighting and computer and TV screens. REEs are actually quite abundant in the earth′s crust. The elements are deemed “rare” because they are found in low concentrations and are difficult to extract economically. China holds 48% of the global REE reserves, and until 2012, production of REEs was almost exclusive to China. Over the past decade, China has been steadily decreasing its REE export quotas, reducing the supply of REEs available to the rest of the world. REEs are considered critical materials according to the National Science and Technology Council, which defines critical elements as those serving an essential function in the manufacture of a product, the absence of which would cause significant social consequence. Thus, it is extremely important for consumers of REEs to be aware of and understand the risks facing the supply REEs, as awareness is the first and most important step in developing strategies to mitigate risk. This report presents a mechanism for identifying the risks present in a supply–demand scenario and determining the criticality of an individual rare earth element under specific circumstances.In “A brief examination of supply and demand in REEs” section we briefly discuss the supply and demand for REEs. “REEs in petroleum refining” section examines the importance of REEs in fluid catalytic Cracking, the largest domestic U.S. use of REEs. “Determining REE criticality: The key supply risk methodology” section presents our key supply factor methodology of addressing the criticality of REEs. In “Scenario analysis” section we apply our methodology to three different possible scenarios affecting U.S. REE markets. “Example of criticality index for cerium considering the increased domestic supply scenario” section contains the results we derive from our methodology. Our conclusions are in “Criticality indexes: Results” section.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"We use a relatively new approach to endogenously detect the volatility shifts in the returns of four major precious metals (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) from 1999 to 2013. We reveal that the turbulent year of 2008 has no significant effect on volatility levels of gold and silver however causes an upward shift in the volatility levels of palladium and platinum. Using the consistent dynamic conditional correlations, we show that precious metals get strongly correlated with each other in the last decade which reduces the diversification benefits across them and indicates a convergence to a single asset class. We endogenously detect the shifts in these dynamic correlation levels and reveal uni-directional volatility shift contagions among precious metals. The results show that gold has a uni-directional volatility shift contagion effect on all other precious metals and silver has a similar effect on platinum and palladium. However, the latter two do not matter in terms of volatility shift contagion. Thus, investors that hedge with precious metals should, in particular, monitor the volatility levels of gold and silver.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"By expanding Frankel and Rose's (2009) theoretical model to consider the interaction of commodity prices with both money liquidity and expectation formation, this paper empirically studies the long-run relationship and short-term dynamics between aluminum prices and money liquidity via Vector autoregressive (VAR) and Impulse Response Function methodologies. Our results show that: (1) a cointegration relationship between money liquidity and Chinese aluminum prices exists, and monetary liquidity positively significantly influences the price over long periods; (2) a structural change has been found during the 2008 Financial Crisis and the change of Chinese monetary policies; and (3) the negative impact of production capacity mechanism on aluminum prices coexists with the positive impact of financial asset returns mechanism, to allow for varied market expectations on aluminum prices within and outside China.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"Over the past two decades the global mining industry has witnessed the necessity and emergence of community relations and development (CRD) functions, essentially under the rubric of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility (CSR). These functions provide companies with mechanisms through which to engage and manage their relationships with key stakeholder groups, share development benefits and protect business interests. Despite widespread claims by the industry that companies have adopted CSR as a ‘core competence’, we argue that the industry has yet to incorporate the CRD function as part of ‘core business’ at the level of practice. This article characterises a CRD function and related processes within the context of a large-scale mining operation in West Africa. Findings reflect a more universal trend relating to the function and organisational positioning of CRD practice in the resources sector. The authors argue that functional equity needs to be established if the sustainable development agenda is to have a genuine future within the mining industry.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"According to Pindyck (2007) there are three important aspects of uncertainly in environmental economics: (1) the benefits and costs of environmental policy tend to be highly non-linear, (2) environmental policy tends to involve important irreversibilities, where investment in pollution abatement can impose an irreversible, sunk cost on society, and where certain pollutants can stay in the environment forever and build up to cause even more future harm in which case investment in abatement can cause an irreversible, sunk benefit to society, and (3) environmental policy involves long time horizons and yet the discount rate society should use is uncertain for determining the net present value of costs and benefits of pollution abatement. These same uncertainties also affect non-renewable, exhaustible, natural resource economics and in particular the use of the Hotelling rule: (1) the costs, benefits and transversality conditions of using the Hotelling rule can be highly non-linear, (2) the Hotelling rule involves important sunk cost irreversibilities, which will be explained here, and (3) the Hotelling rule can involve long time horizons with uncertain discount rates. All three of these problem make it extremely difficult for a market to use in any way the Hotelling rule, yet by the sheer number of articles in non-renewable natural resource economics, one would believe that it is the basis of all resource markets. In this article, we concentrate on the sunk cost irreversibilities of using the Hotelling rule. The idea of the Hotelling rule is to optimally store a non-renewable resource, but the optimization is highly dependent on the actual reserves that are available to extract. However, reserves of underground exhaustible resources are often unobservable at the beginning stages of extraction which makes using the Hotelling Rule difficult.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"Studies of the resource curse as it affects African states abound, yet few deal specifically with the experiences of South Africa. The inability of countries to convert natural resource wealth into income and improved development measures remains highly pertinent and is especially apparent in Africa's largest economy. This paper takes a unique approach to study the resource curse by comparing South Africa's political economy with the existing resource curse literature. Using data from international organisations, studies of poverty and qualitative evidence this paper examines South Africa's experience with mineral extraction. It is found that South Africa has experienced many of the symptoms outlined in the resource curse literature including relatively slow GDP growth, gross inequalities, entrenched poverty and the creation of a rentier state. Overall, it is concluded that South Africa has failed to benefit from natural resource wealth and can be classified as a resource cursed state. Not only has mineral wealth failed to benefit much of South Africa's population, sections of society have actually been harmed through the process of mineral extraction. This paper is the first to examine South Africa in light of the current resource curse literature and to conclude that the state far more closely resembles its sub-Saharan African neighbours than its upper-middle income peers.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"The paper studies and applies the approaches to forecast long-term (LT) real prices of iron ore. This price is crucial for valuation of investments in Greenfield iron ore projects on the horizon of more than 5 years. The forecast is obtained by three different approaches which are usually used by investment bank analysts: marginal costs approach and 2 approaches based on calculation of incentive price. The paper concludes that there has been a structural shift on the iron ore market and LT iron ore prices will be higher by 20–30% than the average of industry forecasters suggest. This is related to the 2 key factors which were taken into account in this study—depletion of existing iron ore deposits and targeted return on investments for new projects. In addition, escalated industry costs inflation is claimed to be the factor which will bolster nominal iron ore prices at high levels in the long-term. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, confidence interval for future iron ore price was estimated.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"The concept of sustainable development is debatable within the mining context as the fact that mineral resources are non-renewable makes mining inherently unsustainable. The need for a realistic definition of sustainability that can be applied to mining is important, in light of claims by the industry that sustainable development principles underpin aspects of their operations. Furthermore, the socio-economic upliftment that should logically follow the implementation of these principles is not visible in many mining areas. Within the theoretical frameworks of intermediate sustainability, our study aimed to determine the level of sustainability that is appropriate for the mining context. The evaluation of community perspectives within the Rustenburg platinum region in South Africa as a case study, based on qualitative information derived from structured questionnaires and informal interviews brings further clarity. We found out that the environmental and social costs associated with mining were high, while economic benefits to surrounding communities were low. The perceptions of community and corporations were found to contrast sharply: the reality experienced by community members fell well short of the optimistic scenarios presented in the corporate social responsibility reports of the mining companies, which has implications for the mining industry in the area. The Rustenburg region is typical of mining areas, more especially the developing world, and application of a realistic sustainable development concept here can help the mining industry elsewhere to move its operations onto a genuinely more sustainable path.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"Communities around the world have increasingly come to demand more involvement in decision making for local mining projects, a greater share of benefits from them if they are to proceed, and assurances that mineral development will be conducted safely and responsibly. At the same time, Bridge (2004) notes full legal compliance with state environmental regulations has become an increasingly insufficient means of satisfying society's expectations with regards to mining issues. There is now a recognised need for mineral developers to gain an additional ‘social licence to operate’ (SLO) in order to avoid potentially costly conflict and exposure to business risks. However, there is a correspondingly limited amount of scholarship specifically focused on SLO. More particularly, there is a need for research that uncovers those factors that lead to the issuance (or non-issuance) of a SLO in the complex and changeable environments that often characterise mineral development. In an effort to identify key determinants of SLO outcomes in the mining industry, this paper presents a comparative case study analysis of four international mining operations: Red Dog Mine in Alaska, USA; Minto Mine in Yukon, Canada; the proposed Tambogrande Mine in Peru; and the Ok Tedi Mine in Papua New Guinea. The analysis that is presented also makes use of insights from supplementary key informant interviews conducted by the author and the emerging literature on mining and communities. Five lessons for earning a SLO emerged from this analysis: (1) context is key; (2) a social licence to operate is built on relationships; (3) sustainability is a dominant concern for communities; (4) local benefits provision and public participation play a crucial role; and (5) adaptability is needed to confront complexity.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"Cutoff grade specifies the available supply of metallic ore from an open pit mine to the multiple processing streams of an open pit mining complex. An optimal cutoff grade strategy maximizes the net present value (NPV) of an open pit mining operation subject to the mining, processing, and marketing/refining capacity constraints. Even though, the quantities of material flowing from the mine to the market are influenced by the expected variation in the available metal content or inherent uncertainty in the supply of ore, the majority of cutoff grade optimization models not only disregard this aspect and may lead to unrealistic cash flows, but also they are limited in application to an open pit mining operation with single processing facility. The model proposed herein determines the optimal cutoff grade policy based on a stochastic framework that accounts for uncertainty in supply of ore to the multiple ore processing streams. An application on a large-scale open pit mining operation develops a unique cutoff grade policy along with a portfolio of mining, processing, and marketing/refining rates. Owing to the geological uncertainty, the approach addresses risk by showing a difference of 14% between the minimum and maximum production rates, cash flows and NPV.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"China has been trying to improve the safety and environmental performances of small coal mines (SCMs) in 2000s through measures of trusteeship and consolidation. The question whether such policy and practice can sustain small scale mining is interesting academically and important practically for China and the world. This paper finds that the Chinese SCM policy has been switched from encouragement to restriction for legal SCMs and from privatization to nationalization in some provinces in the past 10 years. Legal SCMs face pressure to be expanded continuously and to be absorbed or consolidated by large coal mines, which often are state owned. Unexpectedly, financial resources may not be a big constraint nowadays due to availability of private equity investment resources. The paper argues that both the trusteeship and consolidation approaches may only be able to sustain SCMs in the short run. A more sustainable measure is to establish a stable, transparent and inclusive legal and fiscal framework. This paper concludes that those trusteeship approaches may be applicable to restructuring small scale mines in other countries; however, the consolidation practice in China's is unique and thus may not be applicable to others.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"This paper examines whether Russia suffers from “Dutch Disease” by investigating the real appreciation of the Russian ruble and the relative de-industrialization in the post Soviet Union-era. According to UNDP Russia Report (2009) the Russian economy has indeed exhibited some typical symptoms of “Dutch Disease” in recent years as upward movements in oil prices are accompanied by a reduction in the share of manufacturing output and an increase in service prices. Furthermore, the report claims that these developments may trigger a recession in Russia in the future. Using Gregory and Hansen (1996a, 1996b) and Arai and Kurozumi (2007) structural break cointegration frameworks, our results indicate that the Russian economy exhibits some typical symptoms of “Dutch Disease”. Although the diagnosis is not certain, the risk is evident. Hence, policies that would make the Russian economy more robust to shocks in the oil price need to be carefully designed and implemented.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"The iron and steel industry plays a fundamental role in a country's national economy, especially in developing countries. China is the largest iron ore consumption market in the world. However, because of limited domestic iron ore resources, a large proportion of iron ore is imported from other countries. Faced with the conflict between the iron ore supply shortage and the growing demand, it is necessary for the government to predict imports and total consumption. This paper develops a high-precision hybrid model based on grey prediction and rolling mechanism optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm. We use the China Statistical Yearbook (1996–2011) as our database to test the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. According to the experimental results, the proposed new method clearly can improve the prediction accuracy of the original grey model. Future projections have also been done for iron ore imports and total consumption in China in the next five years.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"To examine the impact of the change in forward pricing mechanism on the volatility of iron ore spot prices, we model the iron ore daily price of Platts IODEX from October 7, 2008 to September 21, 2012. The identified iron ore spot price tends to be less volatile after the introduction of quarterly pricing mechanism. Our main approaches are as follows: (i) to decompose the spot price of Platts IODEX into two subsamples and relate the result of the structural break to the date of the switch in the iron ore forward pricing mechanism; (ii) to apply the EGARCH (1, 1) model to simultaneously capture the long memory and the asymmetric effect on the volatility of the iron ore spot price; and (iii) to delineate the news impact curve to further interpret the asymmetric effect.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"The paper examines the copper consumption-economic growth nexus for 16 rich economies from the period 1966 to 2010. Various generations of panel unit root and cointegration tests are applied. Both series are found to be integrated of order one. Evidence of cointegration is found especially when controlling for breaks and long-run cross-sectional dependence. Causality is investigated using a vector error-correction mechanism (VECM) framework. At individual level, unidirectional causality running from economic growth to copper consumption is unraveled for Finland, France and UK in the long-run. Unidirectional causality is also found running from copper consumption to economic growth for Spain. Long-run bi-directionality between economic growth and copper consumption is found for Belgium, Greece, Italy, Japan and South Korea. The neutrality hypothesis holds for Australia, Austria, Canada, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and USA in the long-run. Taken as a whole, panel causality test reveals a long-run unidirectional causality running from economic growth to copper consumption.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"The development of mineral and energy resources worldwide has placed pressure on regional environments, economies and communities. The cumulative impacts, or cumulative effects, arising from overlapping development have stretched political systems that have traditionally been geared toward the regulation and management of individual resource developments, presenting challenges for policy makers, resource developers and civil society actors. An equally challenging task has been realisation of the potential development dividends of mineral and energy resources in the areas of business development, infrastructure, human development or the management of resource revenues. This paper introduces a special issue on ‘Understanding and Managing Cumulative Impacts in Resource Regions’. The special issue interrogates the effectiveness of new and traditional policy responses, explores methods and strategies to better respond to cumulative impacts, and details practical examples of collaborative and coordinated approaches. Papers cover a range of environmental, economic and social issues, geographical regions, commodities, and conceptual approaches. This introductory paper introduces the cumulative impact issues that have manifest in resource regions, critically appraises current conceptions of cumulative impacts, and details management and policy responses to address the cumulative dimensions of impact.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"Australia has experienced rapid development within its resource regions, with traditional mining sectors like coal, iron-ore and natural gas expanding and new industries such as coal seam gas emerging. As a result, there is an increasing prevalence and awareness of the cumulative impacts of the extractive resource industries on the society, environment and economy of these regions. Collaborative governance is emerging as a means of addressing cumulative impacts. This article undertakes an analysis of 30 case studies of collaborative governance in the resources sector of Australia. The initiatives analysed range from those focussed on information exchange and coordination to higher degrees of collaboration that involve shared resources and shared risks. The study demonstrates that there are challenges in using collaborative approaches to tackle cumulative impacts, but that significant benefits can be realised.

"Social impact assessment (SIA) has traditionally been practiced as an ex-ante predictive tool in the context of regulatory approval by government agencies. This model of SIA developed by Burdge and others is based on ‘greenfields’ development, of a new project going in to areas where there are no, or relatively few, similar types of development. The International Principles of SIA signalled a conceptual shift in the practice of SIA where greater emphasis is placed on the assessment and management of social issues across the life-cycle of developments. In addition forms of cumulative impact assessment have been developed for contexts where more than one project is likely to impact on populations or communities. With these changes to the traditional models of impact assessment there is a need to clarify how and when dedicated phases of ‘assessment’ might be undertaken over the life-cycle of a development. In the context of the mining industry, SIAs are increasingly required by governments for incremental increases in the size or impact of these operations. This paper reviews the development and application of Project Expansion Assessments (PEAs) for two large-scale mining operations in Papua New Guinea. It argues that a different set of assumptions need to underlie the model of IA for such assessments, with more emphasis on trajectories rather than baselines, a critical evaluation and attribution of effects, and the incorporation of adaptive management tools into the process.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"Generally speaking, there is a greater amount of quantitative data available to measure and model the cumulative environmental or economic impacts of mining than the social impacts. In part, this is because social impacts are often inherently more difficult to quantify, but historically there have also been fewer regulatory drivers for companies or state agencies to invest in collecting such data. Regulators in some jurisdictions are now starting to require resource companies to report on aspects of their social performance, but companies and regulators are still struggling to identify appropriate metrics, particularly in regards to cumulative impacts. This paper describes an innovative quantitative approach to tracking how communities experience and respond to increased mining activity, using data from the complaints registers maintained by mines located in the Upper Hunter Valley in New South Wales, Australia. In this study, complaints lodged with five separate mines adjacent to the township of Muswellbrook over several years were aggregated and trends analysed. The aggregated set showed that complaint frequency increased with the increase in mining activity but then decreased as individual complaints were addressed. However, when complaints from near-neighbours were removed, it emerged that the proportion of complaints that came from the town itself steadily increased over time. Further analysis indicated that this increase was closely associated with the amount of mine-disturbed land that could be seen from the town over time, as measured using a combination of remotely sensed data and a digital elevation model. This is persuasive evidence of a cumulative social impact that is more than just the sum of the local impacts of individual mines.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"Portovelo-Zaruma, Ecuador is an artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) region with approximately 6000 gold miners working with mercury and cyanide. Although artisanal gold mining (AGM) has taken place in Portovelo-Zaruma for centuries, highly mechanized small-scale gold mining (SGM) processing plants capable of increased throughput began being built in the 1990s. While there are benefits associated with ASGM, there are also negative impacts experienced by the miners and the surrounding communities. To take advantage of ASGM as a poverty-alleviating mechanism while reducing unwanted externalities, the cumulative impacts must be understood. Numerous challenges to measuring, monitoring, and addressing ASGM impacts result from the complexity of the impacts themselves, the nature of the gold mining as an informal industry, and the shortfalls in the current regulatory framework. These are discussed in the context of ongoing, unresolved issues including efforts to address trans-boundary water pollution, management of mining waste, and conflicts regarding priorities, ambiguities, and enforcement of existing regulations and policies. Internationally, interventions to address both AGM and SGM impacts have typically focused almost exclusively on technological changes through the elimination of mercury use. Our analysis suggests that to better address ASGM and their cumulative impacts in Ecuador, it will be beneficial to revisit the legal definitions of AGM and SGM. Additionally, promotion of information-based strategies including educational outreach programs and cross-scale and cross-level mitigation methods may also be beneficial. The success of these strategies to reduce ASGM-related cumulative impacts will depend on sufficient funding and the commitment of stakeholders.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"Predicting the economic and demographic impacts of resource development on regional areas is difficult to assess because of limited availability of analysis, difficulties of predicting where workforce are likely to be based, and different impacts on communities because of variations in size and economic structures. In this study modelling has been employed to identify future employment and demographic impacts of future resource developments on communities in the Surat Basin in southern Queensland, Australia. The analysis summarises potential employment increases over multiple projects and uses multipliers from Input–Output models to assess likely impacts by local government area when future workforce might commute to or live locally in the region. The results demonstrate that recent moves to commuting workforces limit the economic impacts on local and regional communities in complex ways.","Volume 38, Issue 4",December 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/4,22
"With the encouragement of shale gas production in the United States, governments have considered a range of legislative and regulatory proposals to manage health and environmental damages that may accompany extraction activities. Exceptions adopted by Congress to major federal environmental legislation have meant that individual US states have deemed it necessary to provide oversight through regulations to protect people and safeguard environmental quality. In responding, states have legal structures under which drilling firms may not need to disclose the toxic substances used in fracturing wells. Yet, with increasing numbers of drilling sites, more people are at risk from accidents and exposure to harmful substances used at fractured wells. To provide for meaningful health and safety protection, governments may need to reevaluate legal provisions offering trade secret protection for toxic substances used in fracturing.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23
"Platinum is increasingly used intentionally and non-intentionally in several applications. This has raised the concern about its future resources, emissions and losses during its life cycle. On the one hand, increasing platinum emissions might affect human health. On the other hand, the accumulated platinum in mineral waste, soil, landfill sites and construction materials as a result of the emissions, losses and the utilization of secondary materials can be seen as potential resources for platinum. This paper is aimed at (1) analyzing the long term impacts of the use of platinum intentionally and non-intentionally on its future demand and supply, release to the environment and accumulation in mineral waste, soil, landfill sites and construction materials and (2) quantifying the amount of platinum in secondary materials that would be available for platinum future supply. The analysis is carried out on a global level using a system dynamic model of platinum intentional and non-intentional flows and stocks. The analysis is based on four scenarios for the introduction of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). The results show that platinum demand is increasing overtime in all scenarios at different rates and its identified resources are expected to deplete before the end of the century with or without the introduction of FCVs. The release of platinum to the environment and the accumulation in soil are expected to decrease when conventional ICE vehicles is replaced by FCVs. The amount of platinum accumulated in mineral waste, soil, landfill sites and construction materials by the time platinum is depleted are more than double its identified resources and would be potential resources for platinum that are available in different parts of the world. The methodology presented in this paper can be used in the assessment of other technologies and other metals.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23
"As advancing technology and increasing demands for natural resources continue to mount pressure on the environment, environmental conservation and sustainable management have become ever more important. Individual countries have been increasingly taking action to reduce environmental destruction caused by human activities in an attempt to find a balance in between the necessary exploitation of resources and environmental conservation. In Turkey, the struggle between environmental conservation and mining activities is set within the legal context, with the requisite legal regulations (which describe various procedures) in the midst of being updated or renewed. The legal environmental risk analysis (LERA), beginning by discussing the main legal regulations of environmental conservation in relation to mining activities, defines basic environmental components which form the basis of environmental conservation in relation to mining, and analyzes the impact of mining on each component. The analysis (LERA) finishes with an evaluation of the components as they currently stand and makes some suggestions for the improvement of insufficient regulations.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23

Several companies operate within the marble producing area, specializing in both quarrying and stone processing. They have formed a Consortium in order to rehabilitate an area of more than 17 ha. The restoration will be carried out through an environmentally sustainable procedure. The area was previously used as a landfill for waste deriving from marble quarrying and processing. At that time unshaped blocks of various sizes (which are unsuitable to block-cutter sawing), waste deriving from both block sawing and slab/strip cutting (such as broken slabs, strips, tiles) and microfine dust from filter presses of water treatment plants were representing an environmental problem. The local administration was struggling to find new areas which could be used for landfills, resulting in an additional cost for the landfill, ultimately affecting the variable production costs. The project involves the building of a venue to be used for temporary storage, treatment of wastes produced by both quarrying and primary processing, in order to make them suitable as secondary raw materials. The project also deals with the catch basin hydrology of the area involved in the project, the building of a multifunctional centre, the landscaping and other environmental features such as vehicle traffic and slopes greening.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23

"Mining has grown rapidly and is expected to continue to develop solidly in the future with the economic development in China. Based on this trend, how an increase in the outputs of mining sectors affects household income and poverty alleviation is an issue worthy of study. A multiplier decomposition method within a social accounting matrix (SAM) framework shows the linkages through which a mining sector's output contributes to household income growth and poverty alleviation. The decomposition applied to China reveals that mining development has more significantly positive impacts on the high and middle income household than low income household. Moreover, the decomposition incorporated with the Foster, Greer and Thoerbecke (FGT) poverty measure shows that the ‘coal’ sector contributes most to poverty alleviation and the low income household group, which has the biggest poverty rate, is the smallest beneficiary from the mining development. Thus, the policy implication is proposed that the government should give appropriate adjustment on the distribution of income between rich and poor households and help the unskilled human capital from the household group at a low income level to handle advanced technology of mining through education and training to reduce poverty more effectively.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23
"The case of poverty in the abundance of plenty mostly extant in resource rich countries is also evident along the coast of Ghana. Despite the huge salt production potential of the country’s coast, the renewable resource remains highly untapped as output levels are less than 10% of potential output. Meanwhile many of the indigenes of coastal communities wallow in poverty amidst high levels of unemployment. Findings of this study reveal that key obstacles inhibiting the growth of the sector relates to land acquisition, lack of investment, and low level of technology adoption. The study therefore recommends a mix of strategies aimed at rejuvenating the sector to achieve optimum harnessing of salt deposits. This would help diversify the export markets of Ghana and help her industrialization drive towards achieving an upper-middle income country status in the short-to-medium-term.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23
"Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become one of the most widespread business topics among the academic community. Various issues like environmental pollution, economic crisis, corruption, poverty are of major importance these days and besides governments and policy makers responsibility it is obvious that corporations are also part of these problems. In Europe the last 15 years, governments, NGOs, small and large enterprises are making an effort to establish in their business CSR strategies so as to become more competitive and innovative in the global market. The research presents the way 8 Greek companies from the metallurgy sector publish CSR activities and which dimensions of CSR are more common among Greek companies. The companies were selected according to a study of ICAP Group about CSR and Leading Employers in Greece. The findings reveal how Greek companies during the economic crisis make their effort to be more active especially on environmental issues, human resources, health and safety and contribution to local communities. The results of their efforts are controversial as far as their CSR strategy concerns.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23
"Most large scale resource extraction projects in Papua New Guinea (PNG) require companies to negotiate with customary landowners for access to development sites. In the discussion of process and challenges of development and operation of projects, particularly mines, the paper, basing as a case study of land use arrangements in PNG mining, has several objectives to address. First, it discusses land use arrangements in the mining industry and how they have evolved over the last few decades. Today, most of these arrangements involve pluralistic framework agreements which have been shaped by land tenure debates, civil uprisings, government initiatives and increasingly politically savvy customary landowners. This pluralistic process encourages key stakeholder involvement, particularly customary landowner participation which has been an innovative piece of sustainable mineral policy development in PNG. Second, the paper argues that ‘it is not business as usual’ for mining companies as it would generally be the case in developed and many developing countries because they are increasingly forced to be proactive in addressing landowner and community interests while managing mining projects. A brief overview of land use debates in PNG is summarised at the outset to provide background to mining and development in the country. Third, the significance of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) paradigm and its impact on business, particularly the mining industry is acknowledged intermittently in the discussion to shed light on how it is influencing development of local communities. Finally, the paper argues that the post-Bougainville period has led to a change of the old enclave model of mining development to a broad based community driven form of development around mining. However, it is difficult to predict as to how this model of mining led development in rural PNG will span out in the long run. In the meantime, genuine landowner partnerships with developers and government in the management and operation of mining projects in the country are proving to be a positive outcome for everyone despite some major challenges.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23

"This paper argues that actions of large-scale mining companies at the early stages of a mining project establish a legacy which sets the tone for that mine's long-term relationship with the local artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) stakeholders. This paper compares the experiences of Gold Fields' Tarkwa and Damang mines and the divergent histories of each of these mines' relationship with local small-scale mining stakeholders. Circumstances at Damang during the discovery and early development of the project drove a rift between the mine and the ASM community. As the mine developed, a chain of ASM engagement strategies were enacted in an attempted to repair the relationship but which has never able to regain sufficient trust between the mine and ASM stakeholders. At the nearby Tarkwa mine, ASM confrontations have been much easier to manage. Despite early disagreements at Tarkwa, a relationship characterized by greater trust between the mine and ASM communities was established early and therefore ASM engagement strategies have been simpler and more effective. This paper will conclude that establishing and maintaining a positive mine legacy as early as the exploration phase of a mining project is critical to maintaining a positive, trust-based relationship between LSM companies and their local ASM stakeholders over the life of a mine.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23
"The major countries consuming metals tended historically to be also the major countries producing them. It was in their interest to promote mine development to provide low cost raw materials. Over the past fifty years, the share of global production accounted for by consuming countries has declined and producers and consumers of metals have been slowly moving into separate camps having distinct and differing interests. As a consequence of this, governments of producing countries have become more focused on how to maximise the benefit of metal extraction to their economies rather than on how to supply cheap raw materials; a tendency which has found expression in resource nationalism. Governments of consuming countries have in response become increasingly concerned about the implications of this tendency to their economic development and some countries, most notably China, have adopted robust policies to secure their supplies. Through their actions to influence capital flows within the mining industry and to force metals trade into channels which better serve their national interests (a process characterised here as ‘new mercantilism’), metal producing and metal consuming countries are reshaping global supply.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23
"There is increasing international pressure to ensure that mining development is aligned with local and national development objectives. In South Africa, legislation requires mining companies to produce Social and Labour Plans, which are aimed at addressing local developmental concerns. Against the background of the new mining legislation in South Africa, this paper evaluates attempts to address mine downscaling in the Free State Goldfields over the past two decades. The analysis shows that despite an improved legislative environment, the outcomes in respect of integrated planning are disappointing, owing mainly to a lack of trust and government incapacity to enact the new legislation. It is argued that legislative changes and a national response in respect of mine downscaling are required.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23
"Today, the fight against global warming and the coming hydrocarbon exhaustion involve a drastic increase of clean energies. These technologies resort to many minor metals which are byproduct of major metals. We will take the definition of Hagelüken and Mesker (2010, Complex Life Cycles of Precious and Special Metals. In: Edition Thomas E. Graedel, Ester van der Voet (Eds.), Strüngmann Forum Report, Linkages of Sustainability, MIT Press) to show precisely what minor metals are: “[they are] metals that have relatively low production or usage, which occur in low ore concentrations, are regarded as rare, or are not traded at major public exchanges”. We will analyze the byproduct status affecting almost each minor metal in order to determine if the link with the metal main product can involve a threat for clean technology development. This paper will also deal with the theory and implications of the relationship between the byproduct and the main-product and then check it with empirical data. Until now, byproduct metal production and its variations seem relatively independent from major metal production thanks to the non-saturation of potential supply. By 2050, photovoltaic solar development should not lead to the saturation of potential supply.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23
"After top producer China decided in 2010 to tighten its export quotas for rare earth elements (REE), major customers feared being cut off from the valuable metals. The trade dispute intensified when the EU, the USA, and Japan brought the case before the WTO. The export controls raise questions about China’s intentions and strategies. This article argues that China’s export policy should not be viewed in isolation. The export controls are embedded in a greater transformation of the strategic REE industry. Beijing promotes a broad set of policies, including industry reorganization, resource conservation, and environmental protection. Next, the article examines three narratives that may be constitutive of the Chinese policy. Findings indicate that the geopolitical narrative, which sees natural resources as instruments of power politics, can be only partly attributed to China’s REE policies. The major driving motives are domestic concerns for resource conservation and environmental protection, as well as the development of competitive downstream industries.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23
"A strong increase in the demand for some commodities over the last decade will have a major impact on their future supply situation. Of increasing importance, therefore, is an assessment of a commodity's criticality, and especially its supply risk, by appropriate indicators. The literature has proposed numerous indicators of the supply risk. Here, we use the convenience yield of commodity futures as a supply risk indicator to address some of the major shortcomings of existing indicators, especially regarding their predictive power. This paper aims to test the applicability of the convenience yield as an indicator of a commodity's future supply risk. Therefore, we calculate historical convenience yields for 3-, 15-, and 27-month futures contracts for five major industrial metals (aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc) during the period 1999 to 2011. We compare the convenience yields at the beginning of the contract period to known indicators at maturity to find that the convenience yield has generally predictive power for the static stock lifetime (i.e., inventory volume/turnover) and future spot prices. Furthermore, we find that, with some restrictions, the convenience yield is an applicable indicator of a commodity's supply risk.","Volume 38, Issue 3",September 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/3,23
"Gypsum is one of the most important mined mineral commodities of the world. As an industrial rock, it is primarily used by the construction industry. Therefore, the economics of the gypsum market can be correlated with parameters that have controlled the origin and development of the Spanish building bubble between years 1998 and 2006. The burst of this building bubble has been interpreted as the main triggering factor for Spain's current crisis.Gypsum quarry production during the golden period of Spain's building industry, reached 15.3 Mt, with domestic apparent demand as high as 11.8 Mt. After this period, domestic demand decreased to 4.3 Mt in year 2010, and quarry production fell to 7.0 Mt. These decreases were caused not only by the burst of the building bubble, but also from the global financial crisis and the public works investment cuts. This analysis predicts a continuation of decreasing domestic demand in year 2013, of at least 270,000 t.","Volume 38, Issue 2",June 2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/38/issue/2,24
"With a particular focus on low income economies in SSA, this paper addresses the nature and determinants of linkages from the commodities sectors and challenges the received view that enclave development is an inherent characteristic of resource extraction, particularly in the hard and energy commodities sectors. It argues that there has been a steady increase in linkage development and that there are significant opportunities for deepening this process. The opportunities may be greater for backward than for forward linkages, particularly in the minerals and energy sectors. In making this case, this Discussion Paper draws on the experience of high income countries which have resource intensive economic structures, the geographical specificity of many resources and the growing interest of large resource extracting firms in outsourcing the production of inputs which are outside of their core competences and in supporting local production of some inputs, it sets out a general model of linkage development which distinguishes between win–win and win–lose outcomes.","Volume 37, Issue 4, Pages 405-484 (December 2012)",December 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/37/issue/4,26
"This paper examines the profile of the global mining equipment supply industry, looking at the largest producers and consumers of mining equipment, tracking the changes in global flows of such equipment over the past decade. This paper shows that while the conventional producers of mining equipment (United States, Germany and Japan) have increased exports over the mining boom, the greater gain has been made by countries in the South (particularly China). The destination market for mining equipment has also begun to change, increasingly moving towards new mining sites (in Africa, East Asia and Latin America) and away from the traditional mining countries (Europe and North America). In SSA, China increasingly accounts for a rapidly growing share of mining equipment imports, but this trend is associated with the general increase in imports from China rather than China's resource specific engagement with SSA.","Volume 37, Issue 4, Pages 405-484 (December 2012)",December 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/37/issue/4,26
"South Africa has developed a technologically sophisticated and globally competitive mining equipment and specialist services sector. The paper provides evidence for and measurement of technological competency and global competitiveness and a brief outline of why South Africa was successful in this regard. While there are significant prospects for future growth, there are, at the same time, a number of constraints and South Africa is becoming a less advantageous site for both production and for innovation. Current government policy does not address these constraints and the sector does not feature in government’s vision for industrial or technology development. An alternative approach is proposed whereby the constraints are addressed and the companies supplying the mining sector that have sophisticated technological competencies are encouraged to spread “laterally” into new products and new global markets. By way of conclusion, the importance of this sector in developing countries where mining plays a major role is outlined.","Volume 37, Issue 4, Pages 405-484 (December 2012)",December 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/37/issue/4,26
"By 2009, Ghana was the second-ranked African producer after South Africa, and had become the world's ninth largest producer of gold, at some 3.8% of global production, up from 2.6% five years earlier. Gold production volumes and revenues rose significantly over the decade from 2000. Yet gold mining tends to be perceived negatively in Ghana, and is seen as providing far less than it should in terms of public revenue, employment, skills development and spillovers, and localised economic development. Gold mining is often depicted as having an enclave status, disconnected and isolated from the rest of the economy. In contrast, the research findings here demonstrate that after a period of strong investment and growth, gold mining can no longer be viewed as an enclave activity: it is in fact more deeply linked into the Ghanaian economy than hitherto understood, through a set of as yet under-researched but promising economic linkages, notably backward linkages, which can potentially be strengthened by policy and support measures.","Volume 37, Issue 4, Pages 405-484 (December 2012)",December 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/37/issue/4,26
"This paper investigates the dynamics of upstream linkages development to copper mining in Zambia. The breadth and depth of the local mining supply chain was deeply shaped by policies adopted in the 1990s under the Structural Adjustment Programme. These policies succeeded in attracting much-needed FDI in the mining sector, including Chinese and Indian FDI, but had a negative impact on the level of value-addition undertaken by local suppliers. In the post-privatisation era, the dynamics of the local supply chain suggest that supply firms' upgrading and sales growth were determined by firm ownership and value chain governance. In fact, forward linkages to buyers other than Chinese and Indian mining companies, and backward linkages to parent companies and technology providers were critical in supporting supply firms' success in the mining value chain.","Volume 37, Issue 4, Pages 405-484 (December 2012)",December 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/37/issue/4,26
"This paper examines the determinants of backward linkages from the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. Secondary and primary data collected cover firms engaging in fabrication and construction; well-construction and completion, and control systems and ICT. Both descriptive and inferential statistical approaches were employed in the paper. Despite the widespread view that local content in the Nigerian oil industry is very low, there is a clear evidence for the existence of linkages – at least insofar as the three sub-sectors considered in this analysis are concerned. The paper shows that many of the linkages in the Nigerian oil value chain involve local firms, and that this has been a consequence of local content policies and investments in telecommunications and transport. Linkages have been held back by weaknesses in power and water infrastructure. The large investment in higher education in Nigeria suggests that skill-constraints have not been a major obstacle to linkage development in the three sub-sectors. The flow of labour to and from other sectors is indicative of learning spillovers, both within Nigeria and in the West African regional economy. Regression analysis shows that skills, policies, the quality of the national innovation system and their interactions are the major drivers of backward linkages. A number of policy implications to enhance linkage development in Nigeria's oil and gas value chain are identified.","Volume 37, Issue 4, Pages 405-484 (December 2012)",December 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/37/issue/4,26
"This paper discusses the current state and future prospects of backward production linkages to the manufacturing sector in the Angolan oil and gas industry. The paper finds that local value-added links are currently limited to labour and to a lesser degree in basic services. However, there is a realistic and strategic potential for local manufacturing linkages to expand in the oilfield services sector of the industry, which in turn can stimulate industrial development. For this to be achieved, the factors that are currently constraining the expansion and deepening of linkages have to be addressed, namely, a weak local content strategy, a weak local skills and industrial base and the integration of industrial and oil sector policies.","Volume 37, Issue 4, Pages 405-484 (December 2012)",December 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/37/issue/4,26

Drawing on the experience of supplying inputs into the East African gold mining industry, this paper examines the constraints experienced by local suppliers arising from the purchasing procedures of large mining corporations and specialist construction companies contracted to construct these mines. Lead firms become locked-in to particular ways of working which minimise the opportunities that local suppliers have in providing products and services. After reviewing the situation for local mining suppliers in East Africa, the paper examines ways in which lead firms, the suppliers themselves and others (governments and industry associations) can better support local supplier involvement.","Volume 37, Issue 4, Pages 405-484 (December 2012)",December 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/37/issue/4,26
"China tends to spearhead its economic overtures to African countries through high-level bilateral negotiations. These are frequently in the form of China Exim Bank loans for large-scale infrastructure projects, repaid by resource exports to China. While much is made of China's resource-based activities in Africa, less focus is placed on the converse of this relationship—the infrastructure provision that African resources buy from China. This article takes the positions that local linkages development is one of the clearest ways that African countries can benefit from Chinese construction companies' market engagement. The prevailing view is that Chinese companies contracted to undertake the construction projects financed in this way do not use local labour, materials or any other inputs in the undertaking of their contracts. Focusing on the strategic orientation of large Chinese companies state-owned enterprises (SOEs) operating in Angola's construction sector, this article seeks to uncover the determinants of their sourcing behaviour, and the manner in which this is reflected in their use of local inputs.","Volume 37, Issue 4, Pages 405-484 (December 2012)",December 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/37/issue/4,26

Most of the region's oil production takes place in enclave-type environments offshore and in countries ruled by autocratic governments which generally exert minimal pressure on companies to embrace CSR. With companies having little sense of who to target in their local economic development policies and programs, there is always a possibility of ‘offshore CSR’ – recognized here as potentially-effective ideas for improving social welfare that linger within the enclave and never fully materialize – surfacing.

Whilst apparently building partnerships in the villages that surround the Bibiyana Gas Field, we suggest that the corporation remains detached from the local population via their community development programmes and employment policies. This contradiction is submerged by ideas and practices within global development discourse which celebrate the disconnection and disengagement of donors via the rhetoric of sustainability. Chiming with development praxis and the neo-liberal values which underscore it by stressing self-reliance, entrepreneurship and ‘helping people to help themselves’, the corporation's Community Engagement Programme does little to meet the demands of local people who hoped for employment and long term investment, a form of connection that is discordant to discourses of self-reliance and sustainability.","Volume 37, Issue 2, Pages 131-260 (June 2012)",June 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/37/issue/2,28

"The emergence of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the extractive industries represents a bid to legitimize the sector after decades of environmental disasters and the trampling of indigenous rights. But whilst the rise in CSR has meant safer technologies and better stakeholder engagement, there is little evidence of any real socio-economic development at the grassroots. This paper examines the uneasy relationship existing between the strategic ‘business model’ of CSR and the brand of development it delivers. Using evidence from two multinational extractive industries in Papua New Guinea, we show how weaknesses in CSR practice come from greater emphasis on meeting global ‘performance standards’ than on the specificities of the social contexts in which strategies are implemented. These weaknesses, we argue, lead to ill-conceived and inappropriate development programmes that generate inequality, fragmentation, and social and economic insecurity. We conclude that greater engagement with affected communities will facilitate the development of more mutually beneficial and appropriate CSR strategies.","Volume 37, Issue 2, Pages 131-260 (June 2012)",June 2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/37/issue/2,28

"This research examines whether a long-run stationary equilibrium relationship holds between economic activity and the consumption of crude steel within the UK. Using the theory of fractionally integrated and cointegrated processes, and allowing for the possibility that the equilibrium path changes abruptly at occasional points in time, it is possible to determine if steel consumption and economic activity follow a common stochastic trend or whether the two series randomly drift apart over time. Evidence is found to support such a long term relationship. This result is at odds with the conclusions drawn by previous researchers in the area. The reason for this difference may be due to these researchers concentrating only on I(0) and I(1) specifications, without consideration of fractional possibilities and also to a failure to account for structural breaks in the equilibrium relationship. Such conclusions are made within the framework of the ARFIMA methodology that yields reliable inferences on the degree of fractional integration and cointegration. Critical values for fractional contegration with an ARFIMA model in the presence of structural breaks are also derived in this paper.","Volume 36, Issue 2",June 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/2,32
"Resource-rich countries do not necessarily perform well, especially developing countries.

In Mali, a less-developed country, gold export has substantially increased since the 1990s. In this paper we show that widespread analyses, such as those of the Dutch disease and the quality of institutions, are not sufficient to understand what is at stake in Mali, and that the mining sector has proved to be neither a blessing nor a curse, at least until the present. Gold mining has brought budget revenues but induced few spillovers.

"For many centuries, emeralds have bejeweled the rich and famous all over the world. Emeralds have also made many millionaires overnight, sometimes by chance, as in some of the cases reported in this study. On the other hand, even though emerald mining has brought some economic benefits, many of these have remained at the top of the production chain. In many cases mining activities have caused a number of negative social and environmental impacts locally. Working conditions in small mines are very poor in general: with bad ventilation, high temperatures, long working hours, lack of safety, informal working contracts and no health or life insurance. Environmental impacts can be significant, such as widespread deforestation, erosion of abandoned mines, and soil and water pollution in streams. The economic and social public benefits can be minimal. Even when taxes on gem mining are relatively low, much of the mining local activity is informal and the high value-added formal activities take place outside the mining regions. This study aims to understand the dynamics of emerald mining and its impact on local development using the concept of clusters. The research analyzes three case studies in Brazil: Campos Verdes/Santa Terezinha (Goias state), Nova Era/Itabira (Minas Gerais state) and Carnaiba/Campo Formoso (Bahia state). Emerald mining regions attract many migrants, increasing the demand for public services (infrastructure, health, education, etc.), but local governments are unable to provide for them because the activity produces little tax revenue. In the end, there is a growing mismatch between demand and supply of public services, leading to a series of social and environmental problems. However, working with the concept of cluster can help to shed light on policies to improve the local benefits of gem mining, by organizing the miners and their supporting organizations to allow investments that bring long term benefits locally.","Volume 36, Issue 2",June 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/2,32
"As Russia’s largest mining company, Norilsk Nickel was for much of its history an archetypal Soviet institution. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent prolonged economic crisis, in 2001 new management came into the company with the objective of transforming the company into a modern global corporation. In the years that followed, management pushed through a series of radical changes to the organisation and its operations. Simultaneous with these changes, the company extended its asset base in Russia and acquired assets outside the country. The progressive direction of the company was, however, taking it further and further out on a limb and the programme of transformation was not being matched and supported by public policy and regulation. Pressures came to a head in the middle of 2008 when a change in the structure of company’s ownership and a collapse of metal prices combined to bring about increased involvement of the state in company’s affairs and a more national emphasis to its strategic orientation.","Volume 36, Issue 2",June 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/2,32
"Australia has been a leading mining nation and its mines continue to attract substantial investment due to its strong mineral endowment, mining tradition and high skills base. In recent years Australian mining companies have been facing higher labour costs, which need to be offset by other savings. Automating mine-site machinery offers one potential source of such savings.Underground mines pioneered automated technology largely for safety and mine accessibility reasons and to reduce operating costs. Yet these operations now represent a much smaller portion of the total ore tonnes mined due to the changing mining techniques meaning larger lower grade deposits are becoming economic. It appears the future of mine automation will be directed by surface mining as this maturing technology finds further applications above ground and in the next decade large scale open pit automation trials gain more momentum.This paper assesses the implications of introducing driverless haul trucks in a typical large remote Australian open-pit mine. Such automation will save employee and associated costs, increase operational productive hours and ultimately will reduce mine site workforce numbers. While there will be fewer jobs per mine, with reduced costs and higher productivity some previously uneconomic mines may again be profitable.The social implications of greater mine site automation are the reduction in population of remote mining towns and a decrease in the lower skilled labour requirements for the mining sector. There will be an increase in fly-in fly-out mining operations and companies will establish remote control centres for automated mines in larger cities. This may decrease overall labour requirements and so reduce employment in the sector; therefore, the government should be mindful of implementing policies that ensure a fair return on the economic rent of mineral leases.","Volume 36, Issue 2",June 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/2,32
"Evidence from cross-sectional growth regressions suggests that economies dependent on natural resource exports have had slower growth than resource scarce economies. Explanations for this “curse of resources” focus on institutional and market failures caused by resource abundance. With a simple two sector model exhaustible resource model, we demonstrate that the correlation between growth and natural resource abundance can be negative in the absence of market and institutional failures. Since there is no way to distinguish between efficient and inefficient equilibria on the basis of the negative correlation between growth and resource abundance, finding that correlation is not sufficient to conclude resources are a curse, nor is it necessary to find a positive correlation between growth and resources to overturn the resource curse interpretation. We show whether resources are a curse or a blessing for an economy can only be determined by an investigation of the correlation between resource abundance and income levels. Using panel data for U.S. states for the period 1970–2001, we show that resource abundance is negatively correlated with growth rates but positively correlated with income levels.","Volume 36, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/1,33
"The way in which mineral development contributes to economic development in the region where it takes place is important for the mining industry’s relations to the local community. The purpose of this paper is to provide an assessment of the regional-economic impacts of a large-scale contemporary iron ore project in Northern Sweden (including two new mines, two processing plants, and one pellet plant). The regional input–output model rAps, provided by the Swedish government agency NUTEK is used, and it explicitly addresses the linkages between demographic development, the labour market, industrial production and the municipal finances in a consistent modelling framework. The simulation results suggest an average employment multiplier of about 2–2.5 during the maximum production phase, indicating that for every 100 jobs in mining about 100–150 jobs are supported elsewhere in the local economy. The positive impacts in this case are made possible in large because of the existing mining cluster and local suppliers in northern Sweden. Still, these results are perhaps best viewed as an indication of the potential for local economic development as they neglect, for instance, potential supply constraints (e.g., attracting the necessary labour force, road infrastructure, etc.). Specific policies to further strengthen the regional linkage effects may therefore be necessary in order for this potential to be realized in practice, and attention would preferably be paid to policy measures that have positive external spillover effects on the surrounding geographical area.","Volume 36, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/1,33
"Mining activities are compatible with other activities in space and time if they are developed together and adapted to each other. If permits are required for two projects that are not considered to be compatible, the authorities will be forced to decide which one has prevalence. In the event of conflict or dispute, it is always preferable to attempt to seek compatibility between projects rather than waste time, effort and money on contesting the prevalence decision, as costly and lengthy lawsuits will only delay the development of both projects, with the resulting loss of business opportunities. In this article, technical solutions designed to achieve mining compatibility with other projects are described in terms of benefits and synergies for the projects and benefits for the government that avoid complex decisions and proceedings and optimize revenues.","Volume 36, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/1,33
"This paper examines the relationship between quality of life indicators and the gross value of minerals production from Australian regions. We used quality of life indicators, aggregated for 71 local government areas containing mining activities, of household income, housing affordability, access to communication services, educational attainment, life expectancy, and unemployment. We find no evidence of systematic negative associations between quality of life and the gross value of minerals production. Instead, mining activity has a positive impact on incomes, housing affordability, communication access, education and employment across regional and remote Australia. Whilst we do not establish causality between mining activity and quality of life, our analysis prompts a rethink of the resource curse as it applies within a single country. We did not find evidence of a resource curse, at the local government level, in Australia’s mining regions. Nevertheless, we note observations by many other researchers of negative social impacts on specific demographic sectors, localities, families of fly-in fly-out mining operations, and individuals. This contrast may be a scale issue, with the regional benefits of mineral wealth masking highly localised inequalities and disadvantage. We suggest that there is a need to better understand these impacts and, more importantly, the types of policy mechanisms government and industry can adopt to mitigate or avoid them.","Volume 36, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/1,33
"In this article, we examine whether gold could be an exchange rate hedge in Japan, using data from 1986 to 2007. In the literature on this area, most research focuses on the linear relationship—rather than the non-linear one—between gold returns and the exchange rate fluctuation of the Japanese yen. In the present paper, we use the depreciation rate of the yen as a threshold variable to distinguish between a high depreciation regime and a low depreciation (or appreciation) regime. With this specification, we build a threshold vector autoregressive model to investigate the causality between the gold return and the yen depreciation rate. We find that when the yen depreciation rate is greater than 2.62%, investing in gold could avoid the depreciation loss. Therefore, we conclude that the effectiveness of gold as an exchange rate hedge depends on the depreciation rate of the yen. This finding could benefit both the Japanese monetary authority and investors who hold Japanese yen in their portfolios.","Volume 36, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/1,33
"The aim of this paper is to assess the conditions that influence foreign direct investment in the mineral industries of China and India. The paper first surveys literature on the determinants of foreign direct investment to identify key conditions, under which host countries attract mining FDI. It then builds an evaluative framework which allows for comparative analysis. The paper then comparatively evaluates the performance of foreign investment regimes that govern mineral industries in China and India. Its findings show that the overall conditions for foreign mining investment in China and India are not favourable and that substantial policy, regulatory and other changes in both countries need to be made if more investment is to flow.","Volume 36, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/1,33
"Coal is the major primary energy which fuels the economic growth in China. The Soviet-style institution of the coal sector was adopted after the People’s Republic was founded in 1949. But since the end of 1970s there have been major changes: the market mechanism was introduced to the coal sector and the Major State Coal mines were transferred from central to local governments. This paper explains these market-oriented and decentralized reforms and explores their implications for the power sector, now the largest single consumer of coal. The argument of this paper is that the market-oriented and decentralized reforms in the coal sector were influenced by the changes in state energy investment priority as well as the relationship between the central and local governments in the context of broader reforms within China’s economy. However, these market-oriented and decentralized reforms have not equally influenced the power sector. Even though initial coal sector reform spurred power generation, the subsequent fragmented reforms raise concern about electricity shortages.","Volume 36, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/1,33
"In this paper, we extend the debate on the resource curse by focusing on a new mechanism. Theoretically, resource abundance may have a negative influence on financial development by impacting trade openness, the demand for financial reforms, social capital accumulation and productive investments. Using provincial panel data of China, the empirical analysis confirms such a negative link between mineral resource abundance and financial development. The resource-rich regions tend to have a slower pace of financial development than resource-poor ones. Since the positive relationship between financial development and long-run growth is also confirmed by the analysis, our findings suggest that financial development constitutes an important mechanism through which resource abundance can impact economic performance.","Volume 36, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/1,33
"Although the “real option valuation” (ROV) methodology offers extremely valuable insights in optimising investment decisions in the face of uncertainty, its practical acceptance in the mining industry has until recently been slow because of its perceived computational complexity. Recent conceptual advances in the use of binomial lattices and software developments in the areas of decision trees and dynamic programming, have significantly simplified ROV analysis and made it of practical application in day-to-day financial evaluations and decisions involving uncertainty. This paper provides general background on the ROV methodology and an example of how a typical farm-in/out agreement, as a preliminary to the establishment of a joint venture (JV), can be valued as a series of sequential and compound real options. For illustrative and quality assurance purposes, a simple farm-in/out agreement is valued from the point of view of the party acquiring equity in the project (the farm-inee) using two distinct methods, i.e. (a) a binomial lattice and (b) a decision tree in combination with binomial stochastic processes, in both cases neutralising risk using the user-friendly “risk-neutral probability”. The fact that exactly the same ROV is obtained by both methods provides confidence in the modified decision tree approach, which opens up the capacity to value the more complex sequential/compound real options inherent in real-life farm-in/out agreements. The model is then modified to incorporate a number of realistic contractual conditions often encountered in typical exploration and mining farm-in/out deals. The paper demonstrates how the increased complexity of the model can be relatively easily addressed using a decision tree with dynamic programming capability.","Volume 36, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/1,33
"In his recent article on measuring the long-term trends in the real prices of primary commodities, Cuddington (2010) extends in several important respects our earlier efforts (Svedberg and Tilton, 2006) to correct real commodity price trends for biases in the Consumer Price Index and other deflators. First, he argues for a log–linear relationship between prices and time. Second, he proposes a simple and quick method for obtaining corrected price trends from the published but uncorrected estimates. Finally, he illustrates, for the case of copper and presumably for many other commodities as well, the difficulties of obtaining real price trends significantly different from zero when the log values of the price data contain a unit root, requiring the use of difference stationary models.We welcome these insights, which should improve and make easier efforts to estimate correctly real commodity price trends over the long run. We would stress, however, that it is still important to correct for the biases in inflation indices, notwithstanding the failure of difference stationary models to obtain long-run real price trends (both corrected and uncorrected) significantly different from zero.","Volume 36, Issue 1",March 2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/36/issue/1,33
"Chile and Peru produce almost 45% of world’s mine copper output. This situation reflects their natural endowment and mining tradition, but is also the result of development processes undertaken over the last decades. As a result, both countries multiplied its mine copper production in more than 3 times in the last 20 years. Mining labor productivity played a central role achieving these amazing growth rates. Although there is a consensus about the relevance of this variable for the mining industry, the specific factors behind labor productivity changes are not completely understood.In this paper we use a panel data approach to analyze labor productivity in the copper mining sector in Chile and Peru from 1992 to 2009. This technique is consistent with heterogeneity among mines and allows us to identify, describe and analyze all the different sources behind labor productivity changes.The result of the analysis shows that better deposits and operational factors are important, but not enough to explain labor productivity improvements in the copper mining industry, and instead, company specific efforts and wide industry changes, such as technology and management innovations, are as important as the evolution of the reserve base or geological features of the operations.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 247-310 (December 2010)",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/4,34
"We estimate the Marginal Cost of Public Funds (MCPF) for Peru using a detailed computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Revenues from all major sources (including taxes on factors of production, natural resources such as energy and minerals, consumption, and imports) are examined. Our focus is on the efficiency implications of mineral and energy taxes, given their importance to Peruvian public finance. The primary data are from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) as modified to include detailed tax information from the Peruvian Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Peruvian Internal Revenue Service. Consistent with the theories of public finance, we find that the MCPF is greater for activities that face high or widely varying tax rates. The taxes on energy and mineral activities represent a clear illustration of this relationship. The results presented in this paper indicate opportunities to improved efficiency in the current tax mix, and also indicate the financing costs of proposed expenditures that would be funded with taxes on energy and natural resources.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 247-310 (December 2010)",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/4,34
"The objective of this paper is to analyse the effect of mining on economic and social development in the region of Antofagasta from 1985 to 2008. Analysis of development is restricted to spheres described by available indicators used by several international and non-governmental organizations such as income distribution, education, health, poverty, human development and security, satisfaction, cost of living, income per capita, GDP per capita, employment, productive activity, added value and its distribution. Correlation between some of these variables is estimated as well as the gap between these indicators and those of developed countries.The region has advanced towards development since the 1990s, especially on what concerns economic indicators such as income per capita and income distribution where it ranks ahead from the rest of Chile and close to some developed countries. However, it is still far behind in some of the key social indicators such as quality of education and health, access to health services, life expectancy and large differences in the quality of life within the region.The hypothesis proposed in this paper is that the coexistence of high income levels and inequalities in the region is not a result of insufficient resources but of a lack of commitment to development by the main regional stakeholders.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 247-310 (December 2010)",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/4,34
"In financial time series, persistence or inertia is a feature usually observable in absolute returns, i.e., a proxy for volatility. Moreover, asset return series should be essentially unpredictable according to the efficiency market hypothesis (EMH) in its weak form. Surprisingly, recent literature has found evidence of anti-persistence in technology stocks and commodity futures returns. Anti-persistence would be indicative of an overreaction of asset prices to incoming information.In this article, we concentrate on a sample of 20 DJ-AIG commodity future indices—including broad indices and sub-indices (e.g., energy, grains, industrial metals, and livestock) over the period January 1991–June 2008. We conclude that returns series either over-react or under-react to new market information, which disconfirms the EMH in its weak form. Such disconfirmation would make it possible for market participants to devise non-linear statistical models for improved index forecasting and derivatives valuation.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 247-310 (December 2010)",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/4,34
"There is an extensive literature on modeling the stochastic process of commodity futures. It has been shown that models with several risk factors are able to adequately fit both the level and the volatility structure of observed transactions with reasonable low errors.One of the characteristics of commodity futures markets is the relatively short term maturity of their contracts, typically ranging for only a few years. This poses a problem for valuing long term investments that require extrapolating the observed term structure. There has been little work on how to effectively do this extrapolation and in measuring its errors. Cortazar et al., 2008a, Cortazar et al., 2008b propose a multicommodity model that jointly estimates two commodities, one with much longer maturity futures contracts than the other, showing that futures prices of one commodity may be useful information for estimating the stochastic process of another. They implement the procedure using highly correlated commodities like WTI and Brent.In this paper we analyze using prices of long term oil futures contracts to help estimate long term copper and silver future prices. We start by analyzing the performance of the Cortazar et al., 2008a, Cortazar et al., 2008b multicommodity model, now applied to oil-copper and oil-silver which have much lower correlation than the WTI–Brent contracts. We show that for these commodities with lower correlation the multicommodity model seems not to be effective. We then propose a modified multicommodity model with a much simpler structure which is easier to estimate and that uses the non-stationary long term process of oil to help estimate long term copper and silver futures prices, achieving a much better fit than using available individual or multicommodity models.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 247-310 (December 2010)",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/4,34
"This paper examines ex-post 51 investment decisions made in regard to copper mines coming on stream from 1957 through 1999. It discusses two critical variables: investment timing and mine capacity choice. Using a 15% discount rate, results suggest that fewer than half of decisions were made at the right time – i.e., low price periods – confirming countercyclical investment as the optimal policy. In terms of capacity choice, the distortion is even higher, as 36 projects should have entered at least 40% larger or smaller. Realized investment decisions for timing and capacity choice would have caused a 49.1% loss over the NPV potentially achievable under optimal resolutions. Although the difference could be specifically attributed to copper price uncertainty, this paper discusses how investment evaluation methodologies could be contributing to firms not being fully rational (in the neoclassical sense) when investing.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 247-310 (December 2010)",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/4,34
"We use an equilibrium model of a monetary economy to understand the economics behind the correlation between inflation and oil futures returns. We find that some of the positive correlation found in empirical studies is due to the fact that oil is in the consumption basket; however, this accounts only for a minor part of it. There exist other important sources of correlation related to monetary shocks and output shocks. In particular, we find that the correlation is extremely sensitive to the reaction of the central bank to output shocks, while the reaction to inflation changes is less significant. We estimate our model using maximum likelihood with the following data sets: crude oil futures prices, nominal interest rates, inflation rates and money supply growth rates. Our estimates suggest that the monetary authority overreacts to output shocks by increasing the money supply in a more than necessary amount, generating a significant source of positive correlation. From a practical perspective, We find that it is a good strategy to use as a hedge, the futures whose maturity is closer to the hedging horizon. This is particularly true for short-term hedging.","Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 247-310 (December 2010)",December 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/4,34
"In recent times, the prices of internationally traded metals have reached record highs and there is considerable uncertainty regarding their future. This phenomenon is partially driven by strong demand from a small number of emerging economies, such as China and India. This paper uses a long time-series (1900–2007) on 21 metals prices to investigate their properties, and presents unique features of their volatility, including a decomposition into within- and between-group components. If most volatility is commodity-specific rather than “global”, then metals-exporting dependent economies can smooth income via diversification.","Volume 35, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/3,35
"In Brazil, mergers and acquisitions are usually analyzed by the antitrust authorities ex post, following a Structure-Conduct-Performance approach close to the US Merger Guidelines. However, this framework was unable to address the complexity posed by a series of acquisitions of four mining companies by the newly privatized national champion Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (known then as CVRD, nowadays as Vale). This article extends a Vector Error Correction model estimated by the Brazilian Ministry of Justice, which eventually came to reinforce the definition of the relevant geographic market and to test for structural breaks in the price series. A formal horizontal merger simulation model was not viable from the available data. Though international prices Granger-caused domestic prices in Brazil, they explain less than a third of the variance. Domestic price hikes in the acquired miners’ series were observed above the export price increase not long after the acquisitions, and a structural break could not be rejected. Since convergence of domestic prices to international levels were not to be punished, remedies eventually applied by the Brazilian Antitrust Tribunal focused on preventing CVRD from abusing dominant position to vertically foreclose competitors in logistics, a key competitive issue for the industry.","Volume 35, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/3,35
"This paper estimates the true economic income of Peru’s metal mining sector for the period 1992–2006, using a model of green economic income based on Hamilton (2000). The total depletion of natural capital caused by metal mining is calculated by estimating, on the one hand, the depreciation of mining resources (using the Hotelling rent approach) and, on the other, the environmental degradation provoked by metal mining activities. The results show that the total loss of natural capital represents between 31% and 51% of the metal mining GDP and between 2% and 4.9% of Peru’s GDP. On the other hand, correcting the usual GDP measure produced by the traditional National Account System (NAS) for the total loss of natural capital caused by mining activities shows that the GDP traditional measure overestimated by 51–64% the true economic income generated by Peruvian's metal mining sector during the period 1992–2006. The importance of the generation, taxation, and disposition of mining economic rents for Peru’s sustainable development in the future is also discussed.","Volume 35, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/3,35
"Given that the gold market and the crude oil market are the main representatives of the large commodity markets, it is of crucial practical significance to analyze their cointegration relationship and causality, and investigate their respective contribution, from the perspective of price discovery, to the common price trend so as to interpret the dynamics of the whole large commodity market and forecast the fluctuation of crude oil and gold prices.Empirical analysis indicates that, first, there are consistent trends between the crude oil price and the gold price with significant positive correlation coefficient 0.9295 during the sampling period, from January of 2000 to March of 2008. Second, there can be seen a long-term equilibrium between the two markets, and the crude oil price change linearly Granger causes the volatility of gold price, but not vice versa; moreover, the two market prices do not face a significant nonlinear Granger causality, which overall suggests their fairly direct interactive mechanism. Finally, with regard to the common effective price between the two markets, the contribution of the crude oil price seems larger than that of the gold price, whether with the permanent transitory (PT) model (86.50% versus 13.50%) or the information share (IS) model (50.28% versus 49.72%), which implies that the influence of crude oil on global economic development proves more far-reaching and extensive, and its role in the large commodity markets has attracted more attention in recent years.","Volume 35, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/3,35
"The global gold market has recently attracted a lot of attention and the price of gold is relatively higher than its historical trend. For mining companies to mitigate risk and uncertainty in gold price fluctuations, make hedging, future investment and evaluation decisions, depend on forecasting future price trends. The first section of this paper reviews the world gold market and the historical trend of gold prices from January 1968 to December 2008. This is followed by an investigation into the relationship between gold price and other key influencing variables, such as oil price and global inflation over the last 40 years. The second section applies a modified econometric version of the long-term trend reverting jump and dip diffusion model for forecasting natural-resource commodity prices. This method addresses the deficiencies of previous models, such as jumps and dips as parameters and unit root test for long-term trends. The model proposes that historical data of mineral commodities have three terms to demonstrate fluctuation of prices: a long-term trend reversion component, a diffusion component and a jump or dip component. The model calculates each term individually to estimate future prices of mineral commodities. The study validates the model and estimates the gold price for the next 10 years, based on monthly historical data of nominal gold price.","Volume 35, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/3,35

"After a prolonged drafting and consultation process, South Africa has introduced a new royalty charge to holders of mineral development rights. Deciding on an acceptable royalty is a complex process, especially when it targets deceptive economic rents. This is achieved with a variable royalty rate that slides in tandem with mine profitability. The base is sales revenue and to compensate for the need to charge for the mineral in its unprocessed form, refined production is charged at a lower rate. The aim of this paper is to discuss the Royalty Act in the context of its background, the underlying theory and fundamental principles.

"When a mining company selects a site for development, the company begins a dialogue with the local community about receiving the necessary approvals for the mining permits. The dialogue focuses on how well the company can use science and technology to manage risk to the local environment, and on how much economic benefit will be gained by the local community for accepting the risk. A useful approach to better understand how the debate affects the outcome of the permitting effort is to use the method of “discourse communities and analysis”. This paper analyzes two efforts by Kennecott (Rio Tinto) and one by Exxon to develop base metal mine sites in the Upper Midwest of the USA. As the three case studies show, the local pro- and anti-mining discourse community members will not be changing their basic positions as the permitting of a new mine is debated. Accordingly, both communities are trying to convince undecided stakeholders rather than talking to each other. Both sides are using ever more sophisticated media methods to communicate their message to the undecided residents of the community. By winning the support of the majority of the undecided residents, political pressure can be used to sway the decision.","Volume 35, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/3,35

Yet Indonesia is one of the most highly mineralised countries in the world and has expressed a desire to increase investment in the sector in the coming years.

"Aggregates constitute the biggest branch of mining by production volume and the second in value, after the sector of fossil fuels. Their close connection with the construction industry places them among the most used materials worldwide, second only to water. Despite its significance, the sector suffers from the non-systematic register of production data, resulting in weakness to study the main features affecting the sector’s structure and future capacity. The paper focuses on the aggregates production in 26 European countries. Data from available sources are gathered and combined for a 10-year period (1997–2006), as an effort to provide a clear view of the major attributes of this vital industrial sector. Through a thorough analysis, the main drivers in aggregates production are revealed and existing correlations and trends are identified. New findings are also presented, for example the significance of GDP from construction and the strong connection of aggregates production per capita with the residential building sector.","Volume 35, Issue 3",September 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/3,35
"This paper models the monthly price volatilities of four precious metals (gold, silver, platinum and palladium prices) and investigates the macroeconomic determinants (business cycle, monetary environment and financial market sentiment) of these volatilities. Gold volatility is shown to be explained by monetary variables, but this is not true for silver. Overall, there is limited evidence that the same macroeconomic factors jointly influence the volatility processes of the four precious metal price series, although there is evidence of volatility feedback between the precious metals. These results are consistent with the view that precious metals are too distinct to be considered a single asset class, or represented by a single index. This finding is of importance for portfolio managers and investors.","Volume 35, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/2,36
"Following the Boskin et al., (1996) report, it became widely recognized that price indexes in the U.S. and elsewhere overstate inflation. Svedberg and Tilton (2006) highlighted that this inflation bias may have important implications for estimated long-term trends in nonrenewable resource prices. ST construct an inflation-bias corrected CPI (and PPI) for the U.S. and use their corrected deflator(s) to define a so-called ‘real real’ price of copper. Their ‘real real’ price of copper is then used to re-estimate long-term trends in real copper prices. This paper proposes a quick method for obtaining inflation-bias-corrected estimates of long-run trends in real primary commodity prices directly from estimates in the published literature. Our approach obviates the need re-do existing empirical studies using a corrected or ‘real real’ price of nonrenewable resources. The two approaches are mathematically equivalent.","Volume 35, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/2,36
"Recent, pre-downturn, disturbance in the global helium market can be traced to the tight supply–demand position, which characterizes today’s changing helium supply structure. A detailed System Dynamics model provides fresh insight into the helium question and suggests a production path that is closely associated with future natural gas production. Venting of un-extracted helium to the atmosphere remains a central issue. The model indicates that improving resource exploitation strategies might extend a production plateau that emerges in the 2030s. Substitution will result in more helium being vented. To mitigate this, the industry needs to ensure security of supply (particularly after the Bureau of Land Management reserve is sold).","Volume 35, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/2,36
"In this study, we analyze the evolution of Canada's mining industry from 1929 to 2006, focussing on the determinants of the number of firms in the industry and why this number changed over that period. Most empirical studies of industry evolution have focused on manufacturing industries that share similar structural characteristics. Perhaps because of this, extant models of industry evolution tend to ignore industry-specific and national-specific factors that can cause atypical trajectories, that is, heterogeneous industry evolution. Initial inspection of the Canadian mining industry shows that it is atypical in that it exhibits “negative skew” over time in the number of firms rather than the typical “positive skew.” We review two dominant theoretical approaches to industry evolution: the density-dependence theory and variants of industrial organization economics. We also consider possible sources of industry evolution heterogeneity, focussing particularly on “regulatory punctuation”. Using Canadian mining data, we find that the traditional models do not fully explain the changes in population size in Canada's mining industry. As a result, we introduce a number of hybrid models. The results from these hybrid models suggest that Canadian-specific regulatory punctuations, particularly the introduction of significant new taxes, environmental legislation, and incentives have shaped the trajectory of mining firm participation.","Volume 35, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/2,36
"At first ‘sustainable mining’ could be perceived as a paradox—minerals are widely held to be finite resources with rising consumption causing pressure on known resources. The true sustainability of mineral resources, however, is a much more complex picture and involves exploration, technology, economics, social and environmental issues, and advancing scientific knowledge—predicting future sustainability is therefore not a simple task. This paper presents the results from a landmark study on historical trends in Australian mining, including ore milled, ore grades, open cut versus underground mining, overburden/waste rock and economic resources. When complete data sets are compiled for specific metals, particular issues stand out with respect to sustainability—technological breakthroughs (e.g. flotation, carbon-in-pulp), new discoveries (e.g. uranium or U), price changes (e.g. Au, boom/bust cycles), social issues (e.g. strikes), etc. All of these issues are of prime importance in moving towards a semi-quantitative sustainability model of mineral resources and the mining industry. For the future, critical issues will continue to be declining ore grades (also ore quality and impurities), increased waste rock and associated liabilities, known economic resources, potential breakthrough technologies, and broader environmental constraints (e.g. carbon costs, water). For this latter area, many companies now report annually on sustainability performance—facilitating analysis of environmental sustainability with respect to production performance. By linking these two commonly disparate aspects—mining production and environmental/sustainability data—it becomes possible to better understand environmental sustainability and predict future constraints such as water requirements, greenhouse emissions, energy and reagent inputs, and the like. This paper will therefore present a range of fundamental data and issues which help towards quantifying the resource and environmental sustainability of mining—with critical implications for the mining industry and society as a whole.","Volume 35, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/2,36
"There is a large body of research devoted to understanding sustainable growth in resource-based economies. Some of this research cannot be applied to real economies directly because the initial states of real economies do not match the initial states assumed in the models. Using a model of theDasgupta–Heal–Solow–Stiglitz variety the paper shows that inconsistency between assumed and actual initial states can lead to a less desirable, in particular, a Pareto inferior path of consumption per capita. The paper also presents a methodology for constructing transition paths from an imperfect initial state to an initial state compatible with the standard steady state consumption path.","Volume 35, Issue 2",June 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/2,36
"The metals boom that ran from 2003 to 2008 represented the most powerful and sustained such boom since the Second World War. As the boom gathered momentum, the notion began to emerge that commodities were at the beginning of a multi-year ‘super cycle’ driven by demand growth in the emerging economies and, in particular, China. The persistence of the boom helped sustain this belief right up to the point when metal prices collapsed in the second half of 2008. Looking back over the period, much of what occurred can be readily explained by the unusual strength of the demand shock and the lagged response of the supplying industry, with prices receiving an additional boost from the activities of commodity investors. There is, however, some evidence to suggest that the combination of downward pressure on the costs of manufactured goods and upward pressure on the costs of mineral commodities which accompanied the boom marked a shift in the terms of trade between these two product groups. This in turn seems to have brought to an end the sustained decline in real terms metal prices that occurred in the years following the boom of the 1970s. In sum, the key structural change taking place may not have been on the demand side of the industry as the super cyclists maintained, but on the supply side.","Volume 35, Issue 1",March 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/1,37
"The Dutch disease is regularly evoked in the resource curse literature and remains a frequent explanation for the poor economic performance found in many resource-rich countries. Given Botswana's high rate of per capita GDP growth, it might seem superfluous at first glance to ask whether or not there is a Dutch disease in Botswana. Yet, Botswana merits study here both as a significant potential exception to any posited inevitability of the Dutch disease and also because the debate on whether or not Botswana has avoided the Dutch disease is far less settled than is indicated by its economic growth record. Botswana currently suffers from many of the symptoms of the Dutch disease but not for the causal reasons posited in the Dutch disease model. Indeed, many of the explanations for the lack of diversification found in Botswana's mineral-dependent economy have nothing to do with either diamond revenues or the Dutch disease. Botswana has done about as well managing its resource wealth as could realistically be expected but it is unlikely to succeed in diversifying its economy away from diamonds anytime soon.","Volume 35, Issue 1",March 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/1,37
"Australia is prospective for platinum group metal (PGM) mineralisation (in particular primary magmatic reef, primary magmatic by-product, late magmatic and hydrothermal, and alluvial placer type) but its known PGM endowment is negligible compared to that of South Africa, Russia, the USA and Canada. Most Australian PGM projects are operated by mid-cap or junior companies and form part of larger, more diverse project portfolios held by these explorers. Most projects were ‘hot’ while market conditions were favourable. However, as other metals became ‘fashionable’ and market conditions for PGM changed, so did the focus of these companies. Pure PGM companies are rare in Australia. The search for and development of PGM-only deposits in Australia are high risk business activities. No new primary PGM deposits have been discovered since the mid to late 1980s and none of the significant deposits that were discovered or evaluated in the 1980s have been mined. This review suggests that at least several A$10 million but more likely several A$100 million were sunk into PGM exploration and development projects but none advanced to the mining stage. The viability of Australian PGM projects is very sensitive to (1) metal prices, (2) the US$/A$ exchange rate, and (3) large capital expenditure requirements relative to the small size of Australian PGM-only deposits. Most PGM-only projects were initiated at times of high PGM prices. However, advanced exploration, feasibility studies and project development always lagged behind the price booms. South Africa, Russia and Canada contain approximately 98% of the known global PGM reserves. This situation has a very negative effect on the Australian PGM industry as the well-endowed nations continue to receive the lion's share of exploration spend and new projects.","Volume 35, Issue 1",March 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/1,37
"This paper investigates how Korean industry would respond to four different allocation and banking options in CO2 permit trading within a fully dynamic computational general equilibrium framework. Four different allocations are categorized—a uniform allocation and three performance-based allocations. We explore that performance-based allocation and banking lower losses in Korean potential GDP, allowing energy-intensive industry more flexibility in inter-temporal decision making on purchasing and selling permits. The steel industry can derive a particular advantage from a performance-based allocation with respect to energy use, while the semiconductor industry would prefer a performance-based allocation with respect to value-added. The two key conclusions are (i) the Korean economy should replace an absolute allocation with a performance-based allocation, and (ii) the banking of permits enables market players to reallocate allowances more efficiently in a long-term commitment period. These results support the findings of the key study by Kling and Rubin (1997).","Volume 35, Issue 1",March 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/1,37
"This paper examines the issue of land tenure and how it influences artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) activity in Ghana. Over the past few decades, attempts by governments in sub-Saharan Africa to regulate or formalize ASM as a result of the sector's increasing socio-economic and environmental importance have largely been unsuccessful. Even though mining laws have tended to vest all minerals in the state, increasing evidence suggests that mineral-rich lands for artisanal mining continue to be frequently traded between local landowners and miners or interested groups outside the official legal regime. This development, i.e. land trading for artisanal mining, contributes significantly towards proliferation of illegal ASM activity and hence potentially challenges attempts by governments and development partners to formalise the sector.","Volume 35, Issue 1",March 2010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/35/issue/1,37
"This paper develops a method for identifying and assessing long-term supply risks for mineral raw materials. The method is based on a combined evaluation of past and future supply and demand trends. By analysing raw material boom and bust cycles over the past 50 years, we have quantified indicators and defined benchmarks for identifying critical market situations. By applying the method, risks for supply shortage may be identified at an early stage. In addition, a numerical evaluation model has been developed for better comparison between various mineral raw materials. Compared to other assessment methods this method uses specific benchmarks for each raw material to better assess supply risks. The method is embedded within a systematic and comprehensive analytical approach.Based on this model, companies can make better informed decisions for their market assessment and may use suitable risk mitigation instruments to counteract problematic developments.Understanding future supply conditions is especially useful when selecting new technologies for products which require an intensive use of raw materials. As an example, the method is applied to the copper market as of 2006.It is important to emphasise that nobody can foresee the future of raw material prices. But we may aim to better understand the weaknesses of these markets which may lead to future supply shortages thus influencing price.","Volume 34, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/4,38
"Measured by weight, copper is the third most important metal used by man. The annual value of its 2007 output was on a par with the GDP of e.g. Ukraine. Copper is also one of the oldest metals, its employment going back 7000 years. For millennia, it was predominantly employed for decorative purposes, coinage and in warfare. Technical breakthroughs in antiquity, like smelting and alloying, expanded its production and enhanced its utility. Copper's true heyday occurred after 1850, with the usage of electricity. In the period since then, volumes increased 300-fold, while costs and prices declined. With impressive progress in the technology of its production and consumption, the red metal has been able to hold its own, despite the emergence over history of formidable substitutes like iron, aluminum, plastics and optic fiber.","Volume 34, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/4,38
"The cumulative availability curve shows the quantities of a mineral commodity that can be recovered under current conditions from existing resources at various prices. The future availability of a mineral commodity depends on the shape of its cumulative availability curve (determined by geologic considerations, such as the nature and incidence of the available mineral deposits), the speed at which society moves up the curve (determined by future demand and the extent to which this demand is satisfied by recycling), and shifts in the curve (determined by cost-reducing technological change and other factors). While the shape of the curve for any given mineral commodity may or may not be known, it is knowable since the geologic processes responsible for the curve's shape took place many years ago. In contrast, the factors governing how fast society moves up the curve and how the curve shifts over time are not only unknown but also unknowable.Using lithium as an example, this article shows that knowledge about the shape of the cumulative availability curve can by itself provide useful insights for some mineral commodities regarding the potential future threat of shortages due to depletion. Despite the inherent uncertainties surrounding the future growth in lithium demand as well as the uncertainties regarding the future cost-reducing effects of new production technologies, the shape of the lithium cumulative availability curve indicates that depletion is not likely to pose a serious problem over the rest of this century and well beyond.","Volume 34, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/4,38

"In 1997, Brazil approved law ner 9478, establishing new rules for sharing petroleum royalties with Brazilian municipalities. The goal of this paper is to evaluate whether royalties distributed under the new law have contributed for the development of benefited municipalities. For that the difference-in-differences estimator (diff-in-diff) is used, which compares the evolution of the economic product into the municipality affected by the new law with the unaffected ones, by exploring the new legislation as an exogenous change. The data refer to the municipal gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate before and after the event. Results are surprising, showing that royalty receivers grew less than municipalities that did not receive such resources. The difference is small but statistically significant. In general, an increase of one real in royalties per capita reduces the growth rate of the municipal product in 0.002 percentile points.","Volume 34, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/4,38
"Corruption is the main reason why resource-rich countries perform badly in economic terms. Corruption in resource-rich countries takes two main forms, rent-seeking and patronage. Resource rents induce rent-seeking as individuals compete for a share of the rents rather than use their time and skills more productively. And resource revenues induce patronage as governments pay off supporters to stay in power, resulting in reduced accountability and an inferior allocation of public funds. This paper systematically reviews the literature on natural resources and corruption, and outlines the main policy implications for donors and domestic policy makers. A main conclusion is that priority should be given to policies that address rent-seeking and patronage. In other words, policy in resource-rich countries should be less about macro-economic management and more about institutions to prevent rent-seeking and patronage, and about giving the right incentives to players in the resource sector. Moreover, all policies need to take into account their impact on rent-seeking and patronage, and some current policies may actually be harmful in this respect.","Volume 34, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/4,38
"Financial assurance is increasingly seen as a means to ensure orderly, clean and lasting closure of mines. Broadly interpreted, “closure” requires leaving viable ecosystems on mining lands that are compatible with a healthy environment and with human activities, that have low hazard, and that encompass measures to prevent ongoing pollution from the site in the long-term. Financial assurance encompasses environmental surety instruments that protect the government and public in the event a mining company cannot meet its reclamation or rehabilitation obligations. As such, financial assurance is in essence the money available for closure of the mine in the case when the mine owner is not available to perform the work. A general trend towards greater environmental concern among social stakeholders in mining further serves to focus attention on policies and practices that can actually “assure” financial assurance.Financial assurance is also perceived as a means to address closure-related challenges that are increasing in number as well as diversity. Notably, current trends involve a shift towards a greater focus to the societal aspects of mine closure rather than just the ecological. The use of financial assurance, however, also raises some fundamental questions about how assurance mechanisms influence mining operations and the relationship between mining operations and their surroundings. This paper examines both the internal effect of a variety of financial assurance approaches on mining operations—in particular the manner in which environmental and social concerns are addressed by mining firms, and the almost inevitable tension between some form of financial provision for closure on the one hand, and governmental expectations of tax revenue on the other. As a major argument for supporting the conduct of mining is that state revenues from the extractive industries supply monies for the building of human and infrastructural capital, this second area of tension also has strong social and developmental overtones.","Volume 34, Issue 4",December 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/4,38
"This paper addresses the fluctuations in real metal prices: are they simply random variations or do they display some degree of cyclicality? This study identifies peaks and troughs in the inflation adjusted prices for 14 metals, using monthly average data from January 1947 through December 2007. Duration dependence testing, which is performed on the expansions, contractions, and full cycles, finds many cases in which the duration of these phases are not purely random and have some degree of cyclicality. Additional characterization show that contractions generally persist longer than expansions (in contrast to macroeconomic cycles) that long-term real prices have been trendless, and that the amplitude of price changes over the phases has little regularity. For those performing this type of analysis, the appendices explain the procedures for dating turning points and assessing duration dependence.","Volume 34, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/3,39
"It is suggested that natural resource companies undertaking large-scale projects may be expanding the scope of corporate social responsibility by working to enhance the capabilities of the public sector. Naturally companies are concerned to protect their investments, and to ensure their viability. They will therefore invest in necessary infrastructure and facilities of all types, where those are lacking. Such investment often provides benefits to the wider community, but with a few exceptions these are normally incidental byproducts rather than inherent objectives. The motivation for companies to provide resources of all types in order to enhance the capabilities of the public sector to provide public services is usually an expectation is that the tangible benefits will exceed the costs, rather than altruism. One driving force is to secure and maintain a company's social licence to operate. More recently competition from Chinese firms is prompting private sector companies to offer comparable investments in infrastructure. It is unclear whether investment in public sector capabilities is cyclical and liable to cutbacks when market conditions deteriorate. Changing market conditions affect not just corporate willingness to spend but also host countries’ bargaining strengths. In boom periods host countries will be more able to secure straightforward financial benefits through higher tax receipts than when markets are weak. Beyond the specific needs of individual projects corporate policies are strongly influenced by the beliefs of senior managers. External pressures both from international institutions and from NGOs also drive corporate behaviour. The success of investment in public sector capabilities relies in the end on the responses of host countries, and on how closely the objectives and interests of the government are aligned with maximising the nation's long term wealth and welfare. Where they are not corporate resources may be frittered away. There are also questions over the legitimacy of corporate investments, especially by foreign-owned companies. They have a right to offer advice and protect their legitimate interests, but these may not always coincide with those of their host countries. There is a range of questions about the appropriate role of companies, which lead on to feasible and effective ways of improving weak governance.","Volume 34, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/3,39

"This paper empirically examines the impact of oil price volatility on key macroeconomic indicators of Thailand. Following Andersen et al. [2004. Analytical evaluation of volatility forecasts.

The impact of the oil price volatility is investigated using the vector auto-regression (VAR) system. The Granger causality test, impulse response functions, and variance decomposition show that oil price volatility has significant impact on macroeconomic indicators, such as unemployment and investment, over the period from 1993Q1 to 2006Q4.

The evidence suggests that while the corporate–community foundation model has certain advantages over the in-house community investment model, both approaches suffer from a common shortcoming that limits the impact of oil companies’ efforts on community development in their host communities.

"This paper considers liberal and nationalist economic policy approaches to the ownership and development of Australian energy resources (oil, gas, coal and uranium). In the two decades prior to 1983, Australia pursued economic policies in relation to its energy resources which could broadly be described as ‘nationalist’. Governments of the day intervened in development decisions in an effort to enhance the ‘national interest’. From 1983, along with the deregulation of the Australian economy as a whole, policy relating to energy resources was liberalised. Development of energy reserves henceforth occurred according to the dictates of the market. This paper argues that recent Australian energy policy initiatives reflect an increase in nationalist influences and a retreat from the liberalisation agenda that dominated energy policy making in the 1980s and 1990s. Three examples are discussed where policy has been influenced by a nationalist framework: (1) the domestic gas reservation policy in Western Australia; (2) Australian government efforts to promote a ‘value adding’ nuclear processing industry and (3) Australian Labor Party policy giving preferential financial incentives for gas to liquids projects. The re-emergence of nationalism in Australia is occurring either because policy makers now favour it as a path to energy security or in some cases because they believe that appeals to nationalism will generate political support.","Volume 34, Issue 3",September 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/3,39

"Much of the discourse and literature on artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) in sub-Saharan Africa has inherently prescriptive recommendations on how the sector should develop. Devaluation, misrecognition, and criminalization of artisanal, largely illegal miners hamper their participation not only in environmental and political decision-making but also in negotiating potential alternative livelihoods. This article addresses the following three questions: (a) what are the pull and push factors in Ghana's artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector?; (b) what concrete livelihood options exist for unregistered miners when regularization is impeded and undermined?; and (c) in the absence of promising alternative livelihoods, how can the ASM sector be re-imagined to allow poor men and women miners to flourish as recognized and valued members of their society? The findings suggest that as long as currently illegal miners have some expectation that they will legitimately acquire even small parcels of land for gold extraction, they are very unlikely to commit to any of the fashionable, yet short-lived alternative livelihood options that are introduced by external agencies. What Ghana's ASM sector needs is more success stories that demonstrate that small operators can and want to be good environmental stewards, and that they can flourish as recognized and valued citizens.","Volume 34, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-86 (March–June 2009)",March–June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/1,40

However, the picture is complex; while mining income can help reduce poverty and provide a buffer from livelihood shocks, people's inability, to obtain a formal mineral claim or to effectively exploit their claims, contributes to insecurity. This is reinforced by a context in which ASM is peripheral to large-scale mining interests, is only gradually being addressed within national poverty reduction policies, and is segregated from district-level planning.","Volume 34, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-86 (March–June 2009)",March–June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/1,40

Through an analysis of stakeholder interviews and industry performance, the paper argues that the main government initiatives to manage gold mining in recent years have proved counterproductive, as economic returns from minerals have hemorrhaged due to increased illegal activity. The failure of authorities to adopt an all-stakeholder approach for designing appropriate resource policies has weakened the sector's productivity and created new problems. A drastic policy overhaul that emphasizes improved access to fair gold prices, the delivery of technical assistance to vulnerable workers, and streamlining of regulatory institutions is urgently needed.","Volume 34, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-86 (March–June 2009)",March–June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/1,40
"This paper analyses current policy and legislation in relation to the praxis of artisanal gold mining in Mozambique. Approximately 20,000 people are involved in artisanal mining in central Mozambique, producing annually 480–600 kg of gold, 85–90% of which remains in the informal economy. The current legislation, however, is inadequate: artisanal mining is supposed to take place in predetermined “designated areas”, none of which are gold-rich, and, artisanal miners are supposed to get an individual mining pass from provincial authorities, which rarely occurs. Artisanal miners’ associations get support from the Mining Development Fund. Yet, as these organisations are only viable where ore permits long lasting exploitation, their members represent less than 30% of the workforce. Hence the scope for improving miners’ working conditions and limiting their environmental impact through this type of organisation is limited. On the other hand, siltation of rivers and their pollution with heavy metals goes unchecked while the prohibition of artisanal mining, in and around conservation areas has proven counterproductive. The design of more appropriate policies, particularly those pertaining to the environment, hinges upon a better understanding of the socio-economic dynamics of the sector.","Volume 34, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-86 (March–June 2009)",March–June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/1,40
"This paper addresses the role of formalization in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) in sub-Saharan Africa, focusing specifically on Uganda. Most ASM activity occurs outside mainstream legal economies, occupying a hazy world of informal, yet essential, economic activity. There is an emerging consensus that formalization must be part of any strategy to develop the ASM sector. However, the meaning of formalization is not always clear; nor how formalization contributes to economic development. While formalization can be defined in a number of ways, it is argued here that formalizing ASM should be understood in the context of Hernando De Soto's theory of “extralegality”. In this framework, formalization is the means of absorbing existing customary practices—developed informally by miners—into the mainstream of a country's legal and economic affairs. This concept of formalization is applied to the case of Uganda, where, despite official formalization policies on the books, ASM continues to operate outside the formal economy. It is argued that to make formalization work, miners must also be “capitalized” in ways that permit them to move from transient artisanal mining, to more sustainable small- and medium-scale mining. International development organizations can help to facilitate the transition of ASM from an extralegal to a legal economy by creating revolving loan funds, and helping to carry the risk of lending money to miners.","Volume 34, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-86 (March–June 2009)",March–June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/1,40

The relationship between these mining parties has become increasingly tenuous in Ghana, often culminating in violent confrontation between ASM operators, on the one hand, and LSM and state security forces, on the other hand. The analysis draws on a pragmatic approach which Abosso Goldfields Limited (AGL), one of the country's major large-scale operators, adopted to accommodate ASM operators on its concession, and examines the sustainability of the approach as well as the lessons to be learnt from it.","Volume 34, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-86 (March–June 2009)",March–June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/1,40

Two recent governance initiatives in the country's diamond sector are reviewed: the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) for rough diamonds and the Diamond Area Community Development Fund (DACDF). The analysis considers some of the broader lessons that have emerged, as Sierra Leone currently attempts to launch a third governance initiative—the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). It is argued that the introduction of complex monitoring processes represents a significant challenge for a country that is emerging from a long period of conflict and isolation, is suffering from serious shortages in human capacity, and where good governance, accountability and transparency will undoubtedly take considerable time to develop.","Volume 34, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-86 (March–June 2009)",March–June 2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/34/issue/1,40

For these stones specifically, the link between miner vulnerability, artificial treatment and buyer presence is examined.

"Countries that rely on private investors to find and exploit their mineral resources need reliable indicators of their investment attractiveness. This study explores the use of exploration expenditures for this purpose, focusing primarily on Chile.It finds that exploration expenditures can provide useful insights into both the level and trends in investment attractiveness for individual mineral producing countries. However, for various reasons, it is a country's share of grassroots exploration expenditures for specific metals, rather than its share of total world exploration, that most directly and immediately reflects investment climate.Over the current decade, Chile's shares of world grassroots exploration for gold and (more recently and more modestly) for base metals have fallen, suggesting a deterioration in the country's investment climate for these mineral commodities. The declines, however, are less dramatic than the country's falling share of total world exploration suggests.The study concludes by briefly examining the levels and trends in investment climate for the more important mining countries. Among other trends it finds that Canada and Australia continue to enjoy a high level of attractiveness despite the efforts of many developing countries in recent years to increase private investment in their mineral sectors.","Volume 33, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/4,41
"During the past five years, industry analysts have proclaimed that metal prices are in the early phase of a ‘super cycle,’ driven primarily by Chinese industrial expansion. Academic economists have generally been very skeptical about the presence of long cycles. A time-series econometric analysis by Cuddington and Jerrett [2008. Super cycles in real metals prices? IMF Staff Pap. 55(4), in press], however, has used band-pass filtering techniques to isolate super cycles in the prices of six metals traded on the London Metal Exchange (the ‘LME6’). This paper extends the search for super-cycle behavior to three additional metal products that are critical in the early phases of industrial development and urbanization: steel, pig iron, and molybdenum (a key ingredient in many steel alloys). There is strong evidence of super cycles in these three metals, although their timing differs to some extent from the super cycles found for the LME6.","Volume 33, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/4,41
"An important feature of export-oriented production in mineral-rich developing countries for almost three decades after 1960 was the growth of state-owned enterprises. For the phosphate industry, this was reflected in the expansion of companies such as Office Cherifienne des Phosphate (OCP) in Morocco and the Jordan Phosphate Mines Company (JPMC). There was a strategic importance of the industry for these nations and the large capital outlays necessary for phosphate and fertilizer production expansion often required considerable government assistance because of the perceived high risks of private investment in the industry.An associated issue with state-owned mining companies in developing nations during this time was their operation to facilitate overall government policy. Governments often required these public enterprises to increase production in times of lower world prices to reduce pressures on a balance of current account deficit. The empirical analysis in this paper suggests that this occurred on several occasions in Jordan. Such behaviour by several major producers tends to bring distortion to the operation of the world market over an extended period.Debt service obligation has also been an important determinant of mineral exports for highly indebted mineral rich developing nations. This appears to have been the case in Jordan, where external debt obligations often created pressure on the JPMC to expand its exports in order to earn the hard currency required to service the debt.","Volume 33, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/4,41
"In sub-Saharan Africa, artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) has caused a range of environmental, social and economic problems. Most of the donor support pledged to improve conditions in the sector to date, however, has failed to facilitate marked improvements, in large part because emphasis has been placed on technical interventions; at the same time, impoverished miners’ needs and concerns have been seriously overlooked. It is against this background that this paper critically examines the underpinnings and potential of “Fair Trade gold” as a solution to many of the problems plaguing the ASM sector and a mechanism for alleviating the hardships of its operators. Unlike the majority of ASM-support support measures implemented in the past, “Fair Trade gold” is entrenched in the discourse of “partnership” and “participation”. To ensure its effectiveness initiatives must be adapted according to the specificities of ASM.","Volume 33, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/4,41
This article analyses growth of an economy where the substitutability between non-renewable and renewable resource inputs changes over time. We allow for exogenous technical change in the elasticity of substitution (EoS) between these two types of resources as well as for biased factor-augmenting technical change. Our main results are: (1) sustained technical change in the EoS is enough to overcome resource constraints; (2) productivity-enhancing technical change is most beneficial when directed to the resource which is currently most important for production; (3) the speed of productivity-enhancing technical change is crucial for its usefulness to overcome resource constraints; (4) sustainability depends critically on the type of technical change.,"Volume 33, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/4,41
"Cut-off grade is defined as the grade which discriminates between ore and waste within a given orebody. Determination of a complete optimum cut-off grade policy is a very important function during mine life. Using the modified optimum cut-off grade model presented in this paper not only the net present value of a porphyry copper mining project is maximized, but also the adverse environmental impacts of the project are minimized simultaneously. This methodology is more effective in long-range planning. For showing the effectiveness of the model, two scenarios are considered in a hypothetical deposit and the results show that incorporating the modified optimum cut-off grade policy, the net present value will be increased by 3.6% in comparison with the Base Case.","Volume 33, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/4,41

The Aegean Lignite Enterprise produces and sells the lignite of Soma and Can and their data reflect the general Turkish situation. The results suggest that (1) lignite prices sold to the industry increase (decrease) depending on the decrease (increase) in the industrial production and (2) total electricity production and electricity price are the most important factors that potential investors and related persons have to take into consideration for the pricing of lignite in the thermal power plant market.,"Volume 33, Issue 4",December 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/4,41
"The commodity price boom that emerged in 2004 has proved far more persevering than its predecessors of 1950 and 1973. Some analysts have suggested that it may represent the start of a “supercycle” caused by the voracious raw materials demand from China and other emerging economies, with prices remaining high for 20-30 years. We offer an alternative explanation. For a variety of reasons, the establishment of new capacity in minerals and energy to match the accelerated demand trends is more time consuming than commonly assumed, and may take a decade or longer. As soon as the new capacity is in place, however, the boom will be punctuated. Prices may collapse much earlier in the event of a severe recession that cuts the growth in commodity demand.","Volume 33, Issue 3",September 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/3,42
"The purpose of this paper is to estimate and analyse the price effects of the iron ore mergers between Rio Tinto and North Ltd in 2000, and CVRD and Caemi in 2001. The analyses are conducted using a merger simulation model that, based on the pre-merger situation, estimates the post-merger outcome. This paper applies the so-called proportionality-calibrated almost ideal demand system (PCAIDS) model, which assumes that the product is differentiated and that the strategic variable is price. The results from the merger simulations show that in the case of the merger between Rio Tinto and North Ltd, the merged firm has a combined market share of almost 20%. However, the estimated market weighted average price effect is only 2.6%. Regarding the merger between CVRD and Caemi, the merged firm's market share is about 29%, and the estimated market weighted average price effect is 4.6%. When removing Caemi's Canadian asset, which was the Commission decision in order to allow the merger, the market price effect decreases to 3.1%. Overall the results in this study support the Commission's decisions regarding both merger cases, and shows that merger simulations of price effects can be valuable tools in merger assessments.","Volume 33, Issue 3",September 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/3,42
"The social dimensions of the mining industry are increasingly acknowledged as critical to business success, yet remain the least understood aspect of the business concept of sustainable development—the ‘triple bottom line’ of economy, environment and society.In this paper we present our findings on the current state of the debate on, and research into, contemporary issues in the Australian minerals industry since the pivotal 2002 Mining and Minerals Sustainable Development (MMSD) Project. We identify current themes, the diversity of mining stakeholder views, and the different ways resource policy challenges are articulated based on values, drivers, and interpretations. In other words, we provide a social map or landscape of the industry in Australia.In the final section of the paper, we identify research policy and practice gaps and the emerging challenges faced by the industry and by society. In particular, we note that ‘the social’ is broader than the concept of ‘community’ allows.

"Financial markets recognise maximisation of expected value (E), in an essentially risk-neutral context, as the main corporate financial objective of private enterprise. This may be valid for large, integrated mining companies. Yet, most junior and middle-size exploration companies behave in a risk-averse fashion when making decisions about progressively more expensive exploration programs. From their perspective, a potential increase in expected value from either an increase in target value or related probability of discovery, or both, may not be a sufficient incentive to embark in an exploration programme if the resultant increase in expected value is accompanied by a significant increase in possible maximum loss. Risk-averse explorers may be unwilling to bear larger, albeit less probable losses, when the cost of successive exploration programmes is taken into account. The paper provides a practical methodology for such explorers to optimise the decision whether to progress to the next stage of exploration or to farm out a risky project. It uses a decision-tree model incorporating the effectiveness of the proposed exploration programme, the explorer's risk tolerance and related utility values and the probability distribution of the possible value of the exploration target.","Volume 33, Issue 3",September 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/3,42
"This study evaluates the importance of geologic and geographic factors in constraining the location of limestone mining operations for the production of cement in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Cities and their infrastructure require abundant cement, which is manufactured from limestone and other quarry products, but expansion of cities limits the locations of these operations. Possible locations of limestone and cement operations are controlled by geologic factors including distribution and mineralogy of geologic formations as well as depth of overburden, and geographic factors including location of wetlands, cities, and other surface features that preclude development of quarries and manufacturing operations. Overlay analysis was used to evaluate the importance of these factors. Results show that, although limestone underlies about a third of the region, almost 50 percent of this limestone is unavailable for quarrying due to coverage by the built environment, protected natural areas, or excessive overburden thickness. When characteristics such as limestone quality are also accounted for, accessible resources shrink to as little as 2 percent of the total land area. Although the remaining 2 percent of land area may supply local needs for some years, geologic factors clearly must be included in long-term regional land use planning.","Volume 33, Issue 3",September 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/3,42
"There are several strategies open to an economy in its attempt to attain sustainable economic development depending on its historical background and resource endowment. One of such is the resource-led strategy. Nigeria is superabundantly rich in crude oil and has reaped billions of petrodollars. However, the country seems to be facing the problem of successfully translating this huge oil wealth into sustainable development. This paper employs the vector error-correction methodology in examining the long-run impact of the huge oil wealth accruing to Nigeria on its economic development. Indicators such as per capita GDP (PGDP), household consumption, infrastructural development (electricity), and agricultural and manufacturing output growth rates are examined. The results suggest a significant positive long-run impact of per capita oil revenue on per capita household consumption and electricity generation, while a negative relationship is established for GDP, agriculture and manufacturing. Even for those variables with negative relationship at current period, there exist positive relationships at subsequent lags. Thus, oil revenue, if properly managed and invested, could be effectively used to induce oil-led development in Nigeria provided the current inhibitions of corruption, lack of transparency, accountability and fairness in its use and distribution are removed.","Volume 33, Issue 3",September 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/3,42
"There is a large literature on the influence of commodity prices on the currencies of countries with a large commodity-based export sector, such as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada (“commodity currencies”). There is also the idea that because of pricing power, the value of currencies of certain commodity-producing countries affects commodity prices, such as metals, energy, and agricultural-based products (“currency commodities”). This paper merges these two strands of the literature to analyze the simultaneous workings of commodity and currency markets. We implement the approach by using the Kalman filter to estimate jointly the determinants of the prices of these currencies and commodities. Included in the specification is an allowance for spillovers between the two asset types. The methodology is able to determine the extent that currencies are indeed driven by commodities, or that commodities are driven by currencies, over the period 1975–2005.","Volume 33, Issue 2, Pages 55-124 (June 2008)",June 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/2,43
"In this paper, we investigate the presence of economies of scale in the global iron-making industry for integrated steel plants, iron making being the first stage in the steel-making process. Iron making depends on basic commodities, such as iron ore, coke and various forms of energy, required in the operation of the blast furnace, which can be classified as essential inputs and used in fixed proportions to produce iron. A generalized Leontief cost function is estimated using panel data for 69 integrated plants, such a specification being appropriate for technologies with essential inputs that are used in fixed proportions in production. A significant scale effect is observed due to the existence of fixed costs and a linear dependence of the cost function on production. Under a simple linear cost function, a rough estimate of the breakeven scale of plant, where costs equal revenue, is 4.5 Mt per year. Competitiveness, as measured by the ratio of plant average cost per tonne to best practice cost per tonne, can be shown to be positively related to the scale of production as well as the cost of essential inputs. Therefore, low-cost producers are also often producers with low raw material costs and production levels below the estimated breakeven scale of operation. Labor costs, although significant, are comparatively less important as a driver towards low costs.","Volume 33, Issue 2, Pages 55-124 (June 2008)",June 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/2,43

"Mineral economics is the academic discipline that investigates and promotes understanding of economic and policy issues associated with the production and use of mineral commodities. While its origins can be traced back at least 200 years to the writings of David Ricardo and other early Classical economists, it emerged as a separate academic field only after World War II and then primarily in the United States. As a separate academic discipline, its roots are found in mining schools that needed to consider the milieu in which minerals are sold. While geologists, mining engineers, and others with technical backgrounds were largely responsible for creating the first stand-alone mineral-economics programs, ultimately trained economists became participants as well. Moreover, even after the rise of mineral-economics departments, most of the research in the field continued and continues to be carried out in other academic units, including traditional economic departments and engineering schools, as well as in government agencies, nonprofit research organizations, consulting firms, and international organizations.In the decades following World War II, after early fears of a new depression and excess capacity evaporated, mineral economics focused on the long-run availability of nonrenewable commodities and the threat of supply interruptions for strategic and critical minerals from the Middle East, the Soviet Union, and southern Africa, concerns that persisted at least through the 1980s. The relationship between mineral companies and governments (with particular attention on taxes and other ways of sharing the benefits from mining) was another important issue, as were more traditional interests, including market analysis (mainly, price and demand forecasts), project evaluation, and monopoly and antitrust issues.Since then, the discipline has spread from its early North American base around the globe. The range of topics addressed has grown as well and now includes the environmental impact of mineral production and use, the resource curse, the rise of China and India as major consumers, the concerns of indigenous people and local communities, and a host of other economic and policy issues associated with mineral commodities.This article examines the nature of mineral economics, its emergence as a distinct academic discipline following World War II, and its more recent evolution. It concludes with a few observations about the future.","Volume 33, Issue 1",March 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/1,44
"The aim of this paper is to identify principal factors controlling the Degree of Sustainable Development of Mineral Resources (DSDMR) of mining cities and then to measure their DSDMR and reveal their developing trends. To do this, 78 Chinese mining cities are used as an example. These cities are classified on a hierarchical level of the DSDMR in order to support decision-making of sustainable development. Six principal factors controlling the DSDMR are recognized using factor analysis. They are used to measure the DSDMR of the Chinese mining cities and their developing trends. The results show that in terms of the type of mineral resources, the DSDMR decreases from petroleum to multi-resources to non-metal to coal to metal cities. It decreases also from middle to old to young aged cities and from eastern to central to western cities in geographical location. In addition, large and very large cities have higher DSDMR values than middle- and small-sized cities. These Chinese mining cities are classified into six clusters by cluster analysis, which forms the basis for policy making.","Volume 33, Issue 1",March 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/1,44

"This paper argues that artisanal mining communities are somewhat bound to their operations, and helps explain why formalisation, alternative livelihood projects and military intervention—the traditional strategies employed by governments to tackle illegal mining—have proved ineffective. Findings from recent research carried out in Noyem (Eastern Region of Ghana) are used to illustrate why illegal artisanal mining is such a deeply rooted activity in sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis provides four explanations in support of this: a heavy involvement of traditional leaders in operations; the mindsets of many operators toward alternative income-earning activities; the numerous and diverse range of employment opportunities provided by the sector; and the level of investment in operations.","Volume 33, Issue 1",March 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/1,44
"This paper addresses the question: How can mining companies assess social investment projects so that projects create value for the company and communities in which they operate? Mining companies are still wrestling with the limits of their responsibility in relation to social development even though they accept the business case for community investment at a general level. Fully aware of the practical hazards involved in taking an active role in facilitating local development, companies increasingly avoid methods that are overly paternalistic or assume the functions of the national or local governments. Gaining senior management's commitment to long-term social projects, which are characterised by uncertainty and complexity, is made easier if projects are shown to benefit the site's strategic goals. Case study research on large global mining companies, including interviews with social investment decision makers, has assisted in developing a Social Investment Decision Analysis Tool (SIDAT), a decision model for evaluating social projects. Multi-criteria decision analysis techniques integrating business planning processes with social impact assessment have proved useful in assisting mining companies think beyond seeking reputational benefits, to how they can meet their business goals and contribute to sustainable development.","Volume 33, Issue 1",March 2008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/33/issue/1,44
"The fundamental nature of the mining industry with respect to innovation is often questioned. Is it the conservative, stodgy industry commonly depicted by its critics or is it instead a sophisticated, high-tech industry as championed by many of proponents? Using productivity statistics, it can be shown that the innovation rate of metal mining companies directly compares with the rates associated with general manufacturing. This relationship has held true for the last 50 years. A significant difference lies in the high-tech manufacturing sector, which for the last approximately dozen years has held productivity increases of 9.5% per year, in contrast to general manufacturing and metal mining rates of 2.5% and 2.3% per year, respectively.The number of revolutionary technologies developed in various sectors of the mining industry over the last century equate to a rate of one to three per century; a rate comparable to other “mature” industries such as cement and glass-making. In contrast, the micro-computing sector has had a revolutionary technology development rate roughly four times this. With respect to innovation, mining thus appears to have far more in common with mature manufacturing industries than it does with the high-tech sector.Investment in basic research and development within the industry has been low relative to other industries and appears to be decreasing. Much of the industry's present productivity advances appear to have originated from outside the industry, with equipment manufacturers and suppliers to the industry. Given decreases in basic R and D investment by this sector and as well by government programs, it remains to be seen if the mining industry can maintain its productivity advances at comparable rates.","Volume 32, Issue 4",December 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/4,45
"An analysis of 179 junior exploration floats, listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) between July 2001 and June 2006, helped to build a basic understanding of the strategy and business structure of these companies. The “typical” junior explorer raised A$4 million at initial public offering (IPO) to finance a 2-year, mainly greenfields exploration program. The capital raised at IPO entitled its investors to approximately half of the company, with the balance in the hands of the promoters, vendors and/or seed capital investors. Of the A$4 million raised at IPO, it intended to spend approximately two-thirds on exploration, while the remainder was absorbed in corporate overheads and the costs of the IPO. Once these were paid, ongoing corporate overheads averaged approximately 28% of its total operational expenditure. However, given an average total annual expenditure of approximately A$2.6 million, most juniors held insufficient capital reserves to meet operational costs beyond a time frame of 2 years. As at October 2006, 9% of the companies were in the process of mine construction, whereas 6% had made it to producer status. The lead time from listing to production ranged from 1.5 to 53 months, giving a median of 28 months.","Volume 32, Issue 4",December 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/4,45
"According to existing estimates, available old copper scrap has more than tripled over the past 40 years. Secondary production (that is, copper produced from recycling old scrap), however, has only doubled. Indeed, over the past 10 years, while copper consumption and primary production have continued to expand briskly, while available old scrap has increased by over 35%, secondary production has actually stagnated.For a world concerned with sustainable development and the quality of the earth's environment, this performance is disappointing and in need of explanation. Other things being equal, one would expect the amount of recycling to increase with the availability of scrap, as many econometric models of the world copper market developed over the past several decades explicitly assume.The key to understanding sluggish growth in secondary production, this paper argues, is distinguishing carefully between (1) the flow of old scrap that arrives each year from products reaching the end of their useful lives during the year and (2) the available stock of old scrap that was not recycled during earlier years presumably because it was too costly to do so. Using an econometric model, the paper shows that old scrap stocks, which have contributed most of the increase in available old copper scrap over the years, have a very modest impact on secondary production. Old scrap flows have a much greater effect, but they account for only about 4% of the available old scrap for any given year.","Volume 32, Issue 4",December 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/4,45
"The purpose of this paper is to analyse the competitive and efficiency impacts of a large merger in the world iron ore industry, using an event study approach. This method builds on an analysis of stock market reactions of the merging firms as well as close rivals at the time of the merger announcement. The event study method allows for the possibility to assess both the motivations behind as well as the welfare effects of the merger. The event study results for the merger announcement of Rio Tinto and North Ltd. show that, according to the market reactions, the main motive behind the merger was either the market power or the efficiency hypothesis. When adjusting the analysis to include several information releases about the merger, the overall result indicates that efficiency improvements were the predominant motives behind the merger. Thus, the event study results suggest that there are positive welfare effects to expect and the European Commission's decision to allow the merger is supported.","Volume 32, Issue 4",December 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/4,45
"This study examines the links between mineral dependency and corruption. Specifically, it develops a cross-section econometric model that estimates the effects of per capita income, fuel exports, non-fuel exports, and average per unit value of mineral exports on corruption.The results indicate that fuel and non-fuel mineral exports affect corruption differently. Corruption increases with fuel exports in an unambiguous manner. Non-fuel mineral exports tend to increase corruption only in poor countries, particularly affecting those exporting high value mineral commodities such as diamonds and gold. In richer countries, non-fuel mineral exports actually reduce corruption. In addition, while economic development reflected by rising per capita income ultimately reduces corruption, the evidence indicates that at early stages of development, advances in per capita income are associated with greater corruption. These findings suggest that the links between corruption on the one hand and mineral dependency and per capita income on the other are far more complex than widely recognized.","Volume 32, Issue 3",September 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/3,46
"In recent years, the so-called ‘resource curse’ syndrome has gained increasing currency. Growing evidence suggests that many African countries with significant natural wealth have actually reaped limited rewards, instead experiencing underdevelopment, corruption, political instability, and in some cases, violent conflict. In the small West African state of Sierra Leone, it has been suggested that diamonds played a key role in fuelling a brutal civil war during the 1990s, an issue that has given rise to a burgeoning literature on ‘blood diamonds’. However, as Sierra Leone emerges from a decade of destruction, other research suggests that diamonds could actually provide the impetus for post-war reconstruction. This paper explores the role of alluvial diamond mining in post-conflict Sierra Leone, focusing on two communities in the Eastern Province that were badly affected by the war. Drawing on field-based research conducted between 2002 and 2007, the paper considers the diamond mining situation in the context of broader development strategies in post-conflict reconstruction. It is argued that sustainable development can only be achieved if future policies are based on a detailed understanding of relationships between diamond mining and rural development at local, regional and national levels.","Volume 32, Issue 3",September 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/3,46
"Over the last few years, many studies have presented the real options valuation (ROV) as a promising technique of valuing natural resource investments under conditions of uncertainty. Apart from the common conclusion that the ROV is better than the conventional net present value (NPV) method in integrating the value of management flexibility and proper handling of cash flows risk, there is a lack of procedures for testing the usefulness and advantages of the ROV over the static NPV method in practice. Arguably, it is not yet clear whether the ROV can deal with the complexity of mining projects and whether it can really be applied to make decisions that improve project value.This work aims to take steps towards filling the gap in existing literature by dealing with the above-mentioned concerns. First, this paper proposes a simulation-based ROV method that can handle multiple uncertainties as well as the variability of cash flow parameters that characterize mining projects. Second, the paper presents an example for investigating the impact ROV may have on project profitability, by improving the decision making process. A case study of selecting the most profitable design and production sequence for an actual Australian gold mine under multiple sources of uncertainty is provided. Both the conventional NPV method and the proposed real options technique are applied to evaluate the various technically feasible mine plans with fixed schedules so as to select the most economically appealing one. The results show that the design based on value maximization indicated by the static NPV method is different from that of the ROV. Comparing the design values estimated based on the actual market data recommended by both techniques shows that the value of the ROV-based design is 11–18% higher than the value of the NPV-based design.","Volume 32, Issue 3",September 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/3,46
"This paper examines the effect of crude oil prices on the prices of 35 internationally traded primary commodities for the 1960–2005 period. It finds that the pass-through of crude oil price changes to the overall non-energy commodity index is 0.16. At a more disaggregated level, the fertilizer index had the highest pass-through (0.33), followed by agriculture (0.17), and metals (0.11). The prices of precious metals also exhibited a strong response to crude oil price. In terms of individual commodities, the estimates of the food group exhibited remarkable similarity while those of raw materials and metals gave a mixed picture. The implication is that if crude oil prices remain high for some time, as most analysts expect, then the recent commodity price boom is likely to last much longer than earlier booms, at least for food commodities. The other commodities, however, are likely to follow diverging paths. On the methodological side, the results show that price indices, while providing useful summary statistics, they need to be supplemented by individual commodity analysis.","Volume 32, Issue 3",September 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/3,46
"While the oil industry along the Atlantic coast of Cameroon has made important contributions to the national economy, this has been accompanied with adverse environmental impacts. There has been significant pollution from oil drilling, refinery waste, oil spillage, gas and flaring. After discussing these impacts, this paper argues that prevailing regulations are inadequate and need overhauling. It proposes that cleaner production requires:(i)specific laws to protect dwellers in the neighbourhood of oil refineries, filling stations, service stations and pipelines;(ii)adoption of national standards for levels of industrial effluents, and allocation of sufficient resources for monitoring these standards;(iii)formation of industry–government research partnerships;(iv)the divorcing of gas flaring; and(v)a more comprehensive legislation enabling a robust public participation in environmental impact assessment and nomination of indicators to evaluate corporate environmental management plans.","Volume 32, Issue 3",September 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/3,46
"During the 1945–1975 period copper differed from other major non-ferrous metals and mineral products in experiencing rising real prices, on a trend basis. This paper examines the major features of supply and demand over the period, including the impact of economic activity, changing locations of consumption and trends in costs. Government controls affecting both supply and demand and US government stockpiling policies were all pervasive especially in the 1950s. Supply was throughout periodically interrupted by lengthy and widespread strikes and was also subject to frequent and wide-ranging political disturbances during the 1960s. From the early 1960s onwards a substantial share of world production became state controlled, profoundly altering the objectives and commercial policies of suppliers. Tightening anti-trust legislation and the changing location of consumption combined with changes in ownership to weaken the willingness and ability of suppliers to influence prices. The paper concludes that the behaviour of copper prices during the 1945–1975 period arose from the particular circumstances of the time and offers very little guidance, if any, to likely future trends.","Volume 32, Issues 1–2",March–June 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/1,47
"This study questions recent research [Gordon, R.B., Bertram, M., Graedel, T.E., 2006. Metal stocks and sustainability. Proc. Natl. Acad. USA 103(5), 1209–1214] that concludes that the world is likely to experience a growing scarcity of copper over this century. In particular, it focuses on the methodology used in this work that assumes the usable copper contained in the earth is a fixed amount. While the fixed-stock paradigm is intuitively appealing—after all the earth is finite so the amount of any commodity it contains must also be finite—and used with some frequency by others as well to assess long-run trends in the availability of non-renewable mineral resources, it is flawed and can lead to overly pessimistic as well as overly optimistic expectations. A more useful and appropriate approach, the opportunity-cost paradigm, assesses long-run trends in availability by real prices or alternative measures of what society has to give up or sacrifice to obtain another ton of copper or barrel of oil. This approach indicates that copper could conceivably become less scarce by the end of the century. Whether this will be the case or whether copper will be more scarce, however, depends on a number of factors, including the future course of technological change, whose influence no one can predict with any degree of certainty decades in advance.","Volume 32, Issues 1–2",March–June 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/1,47
"The sustainability of metal supplies can be discussed from a physical perspective, as done here, as well as from an economic one. The physical approach involves the concept of limits to virgin supplies, either absolute or arising from external constraints, as well as the sometimes-overlooked additional supply provided by recycling and reuse. At present, economic geology data are too sparse to accurately quantify many of these issues, but current trends imply increased emphasis on recycling and the use of alternative materials for some of the metals widely employed in modern technology.","Volume 32, Issues 1–2",March–June 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/1,47
"This article critically examines the issue of growing female participation in the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector, particularly within its illegal segment, drawing upon experiences from Birim North District in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Although an estimated 50% of those employed in ASM are women, few researchers have investigated what roles women play in the sector, or how their participation contributes to rural development. The paper aims to examine the causes of female participation in the ASM sector and the impact of this type of employment on women's income, health and families. An analysis of collected data suggests that there is a growing need for policies to address female employment in ASM and, more generally, rural employment. The analysis demonstrates the utility of gender mainstreaming in the small-scale mining formalisation process, as well as the need to promote other viable employment opportunities for the benefit of women residing in rural areas.","Volume 32, Issues 1–2",March–June 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/1,47
"In recent years, due to public concern over perceived and actual environmental impacts, the global mining industry has been moving towards a more sustainable framework. For gold mining, there are a number of fundamental issues with regard to assessing sustainability. Commonly perceived as a finite and non-renewable resource, long-term gold production trends include declining ore grades and increasing solid wastes (tailings, waste rock) and open cut mining. Conversely, core sustainability issues include water, energy and chemical consumption and pollutant emissions—also known as ‘resource intensity’. It is important to recognise the links between gold production trends and resource intensity, as this is critical for understanding future sustainability challenges. This paper links data sets on historic gold mining production trends with emerging sustainability reporting to estimate resource intensity, demonstrating the sensitivity of ore grade for gold production and sustainability. Final judgement of the sustainability of gold mining must take account of the sensitivity of the ore grade in the resource intensity of gold production. This has implications for environmental policy and sustainability reporting in the gold mining sector.","Volume 32, Issues 1–2",March–June 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/1,47
"Mining often brings certain irreversible changes to the surrounding environment. Different types of natural resources mostly surround the mines. Degradation of natural resources around the active mining zone may adversely affect the local economy. After cessation of mining operations local people may no longer be able to sustain their livelihood from the surrounding degraded natural resource; there are chances that the economy of the region will be shattered. The paper deals with this problem of local level sustainability of iron ore mining in eastern India. This problem is examined in the light of different theories of sustainability and national policies. By using household survey data, sustainability of iron ore mining in this region is tested. Substitution of depleting natural capital with other forms of capital can promote long-term sustainability of the local economy. This necessitates certain policy interventions to induce the mine operators to reinvest some part of their resource rent in the natural capital of the region.","Volume 32, Issues 1–2",March–June 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/1,47
"Taiwan, a nation with a high population density and a lack of natural resources, depends on imports for almost 100% of its energy and metal needs. Municipal solid waste (MSW) management has become a vital environmental issue in the country. In this regard, resource recycling is thus becoming attractive and part of environmental and economic policies for promoting sustainable development and for attaining the goal of “zero waste” in recent years. The objective of this paper is to present an integrated evaluation of MSW in light of Taiwan's government laws and regulations. The description first focuses on the current status of MSW generation and clearance and its recycling. It also centers on new, revised legislation and regulations (especially policies concerning environmental protection and financial incentives for MSW recycling), which have become effective since 1997. The regulatory system (i.e., Waste Disposal Act, Environmental Basis Law, and Statute for Upgrading Industries) is not only to give financial incentives, but also to provide technical assistances and transfer of information for promoting resource recycling. As a newly developed country, Taiwan's recycling system—the “4-in-1 Recycling System”, which includes the Resource Recycling Management Fund—has successfully proceeded and will provide a cost-effective demonstration for those countries that are developing their resource recycling from MSW.","Volume 32, Issues 1–2",March–June 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/1,47
"This article compares four non-linear forecasting methods: multiplicative seasonal ARIMA, unobserved components (UC), wavelet-based and support vector machines (SVM). Whereas the first two methods are well known in the time series field, the other two rely on recently developed mathematical techniques. Based on forecasting accuracy and encompassing tests applied to shipments data of the U.S. metal and material manufacturing industry for 1958–2000, we conclude that that these two novel forecast techniques can either outperform the traditional ones or provide them with extra forecast information. In particular, based on the Granger–Newbold test, it appears that wavelets may be a promising new technique.","Volume 32, Issues 1–2",March–June 2007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/32/issue/1,47
"Most large mining companies grow by acquisition and conduct due diligence assessments in order to identify the opportunities and risks associated with potential acquisitions.Due diligence assessment is usually restricted to considering the financial aspects of an asset, and often overlooks the non-financial risks that may compromise the economic viability or operability of a project. However, experience has shown that neglecting non-financial risk areas such as environmental, socio-economic and sustainability performance may be problematic and, under extreme circumstances, potentially disastrous, particularly in a developing world context.This paper examines the due diligence process and identifies the limitations of conventional assessments based solely on financial risk. It presents practical recommendations on structuring due diligence assessments to consider non-financial risk so that the full risk profile of an asset can be identified.","Volume 31, Issue 4",December 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/4,48
"Most Taiwanese farmers usually blend rice straws into the soil after harvest. However, rice straws possess great thermal energy, which can be used to produce refuse-derived fuel (RDF-5). As Taiwan faces energy shortage, the development benefits of the RDF-5 industry are tempting. This study employs the Hotelling model to design the locations and the optimal numbers of RDF-5 plants. From the technology and material supply point of view, turning waste rice straws into RDF-5 is feasible in Taiwan. Nevertheless, from the business operation perspective, even if the RDF-5 plant is willing to lower its profit rate, its selling price is still hard to compete with imported RDF-5. If the Taiwanese government decides to pursue RDF-5 as an alternative energy, they might need to take a step further to subsidize entrepreneurs or provide appropriate tax benefits. Otherwise, the RDF-5 industry is hard to survive in Taiwan.","Volume 31, Issue 4",December 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/4,48
"Economic sustainability or intergenerational equity entails maintaining social well-being by decisions about investments in different types of assets. Under certain conditions, consumption can be sustained by depleting resources, or various kinds of natural capital, while building up other kinds of capital. Theoretically, the choices involve the use of a set of accounting prices. The question becomes one of finding and implementing accounting prices that express the roles of the various capital goods in achieving the objective of the economy.Hartwick's rule holds that an economy can be sustained if the value of the total, net investment in the economy, evaluated at those accounting prices, is zero. The rule applies to a special, abstract economic model which expresses a social objective different from the discounted-utilitarian objective on which national accounting is based. Different objectives give rise to different accounting prices. Because the prices may not be right, the zero net-investment rule using available national-accounting prices cannot generate a condition for sustaining an economy.Still, environmental accounting is a tool which, used prudently, can make an important contribution to social decision-making. This paper expands upon these ideas by discussing the incorporation of natural resource and intangible environmental costs and benefits into green accounting at the firm as well as the economy level. Common techniques of mine valuation and standard corporate accounting are the bases for this extension to the valuation of and accounting for decisions concerning the environment.","Volume 31, Issue 4",December 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/4,48
"Water is a limited and unevenly distributed resource in China, with the per capita amount of water resource there only about one-fourth of the world's average. However, water is an essential resource for people's lives and economic development. Over the past two decades China has seen the fruit of its rapid economic growth; nevertheless, a severe water shortage is behind this prosperous scenario and is becoming worse. Efficient water supply is certainly essential for the sustainable development of human beings. This paper analyzes water efficiency by incorporating water as an input as well as using conventional inputs such as labor employment and capital stock. An index of a water adjustment target ratio (WATR) is established from the production frontier constructed by data envelopment analysis (DEA) including water as an input. The water efficiency of regions is obtained from a total-factor framework with both residential and productive water use. A U-shape relation is discovered between the total-factor water efficiency and per capita real income among areas in China. The central area has the worst water efficiency ranking and the total adjustment amount of water used there is around three-fourths of China's total. More efficient production processes and advanced technologies need to be adopted in the central area to improve its water efficiency, especially for its productive use of water.","Volume 31, Issue 4",December 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/4,48
"This paper explains how the well-accepted concept of improved stakeholder participation during mineral policy development leads to a national mineral policy that accommodates the diverging views and interests that allows wide acceptance of decisions, enhancing the success of implementation and, ultimately, national benefits. This process is based on lessons learnt during the South African experience and has been successfully applied in the development of the Namibian and Malawian national minerals policies. An effective policy in the SADC will engineer the delicate balance between poverty reduction and an internationally competitive minerals sector. This balance enhances the possibility of long-term economic growth and development in the SADC region. The overriding advantage of this strategy is that it generates ‘home-grown’ policy instruments and implementation of mineral law with which stakeholders can identify. This process presents a new challenge to traditional policy formulation strategies in emerging economies and the bottom-up approach, linked to wide political support, allows the potential realisation of national objectives.","Volume 31, Issue 4",December 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/4,48
"Using a time-varying stochastic frontier model, this paper examines the technical efficiency of firms in the iron and steel industry to try to identify the factors contributing to the industry's efficiency growth. Industry observers and policymakers tend to cite most frequently three possible sources of efficiency growth: privatization; economies of scale; and vintage of equipment. Our study corroborates these factors. Based on our findings, which pertain to 52 iron and steel firms over the period of 1978–1997, privatization is likely to improve the efficiency of iron and steel firms to a great extent as evidenced in various industries. This study also provides systematic evidence that iron and steel production shows economies of scale. In addition, newer vintages of equipment are found to be closely correlated with higher levels of efficiency. This clearly indicates that investment in new plants and equipments is critical in pursuit of efficiency in the iron and steel industry.","Volume 31, Issue 4",December 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/4,48

Issues addressed include the apparent decline in corporate research and development spending, changing patterns in research collaboration and outsourcing, and the uptake of information and communication technologies in the industry.

"Mining of construction aggregate is often unwelcome near communities because of its disamenities or because it can destroy prime farmland and displace other desirable land uses. Such conflicts have led to prohibitions against mining near cities or on high-value farmland, causing these operations to be relocated to more distant locations. The cost of this relocation may go unnoticed if they are indirect, diffused and rise gradually over time, but they may be significant due to the high transportation cost of moving these materials long distances.This study evaluates the economic cost of a proposed ban on new aggregate mines on high-value farmland in Oregon, USA. The analysis here finds that the cumulative cost would be $40,000 per acre of “saved farmland,” compared to the current market value of $2000 per acre. Moreover, the policy would “save” less than 1% of high-value farmland over the next 45 years.","Volume 31, Issue 3",September 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/3,49
"This paper investigates whether and how World Bank mining sector reforms have fuelled the expansion of illegal artisanal mining activity in Sub-Saharan Africa. In doing so, the analysis examines three issues. First, the emerging correlation between reforms and poverty, mainly a result of increased unemployment caused by Structural Adjustment Programmes and concurrent privatisation of state-owned enterprises, is explored. Second, the possibility that reform of large-scale mining has decreased available land for peasant farming as well as legalised small-scale mining activity is discussed. Finally, the notion that the regularisation of informal mining activities has been an exceedingly bureaucratic procedure in Africa, therefore providing individuals with little incentive to operate within the legal domain, is examined. Faced with few employment prospects, a growing number of Africans are pursuing employment in the artisanal mining sector, a worrying prospect given its intimate association with environmental degradation and HIV/AIDS.","Volume 31, Issue 3",September 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/3,49

First, it is questionable whether developing countries have the institutional capacity to implement and operate such funds successfully.

Finally, as a comparative case study of the three natural resource-intensive economies that successfully steered clear of excessive real appreciation and crowding out of the non-minerals tradables sector—Botswana, Indonesia and Norway—shows, citizen funds are likely to carry detrimental indirect effects on the ability of governments to surmount the Dutch Disease.","Volume 31, Issue 3",September 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/3,49

"In the real option pricing model of valuation and decision making, the estimation of future volatility is a key input parameter. For traded commodities or financial assets, past volatility is used as a proxy for predictions. But, for projects, this approach is not feasible because, in most cases, historical data of traded projects are not available. As an alternate solution, it is usually assumed that project volatility is equal to that of commodity price. In order to investigate this assumption, we estimate the project volatility considering that both commodity price and operating cost evolve as a geometric Brownian motion (GBM). Results of a hypothetical gold mining project indicate that project volatility is higher than that of commodity price and it only drops to price volatility under very unrealistic industry conditions, such as very high prices or very low production costs. In addition, we find that project volatility is independent of production capacity and taxation, but depends on increments in price and cost, as well as strongly on their degree of correlation.","Volume 31, Issue 2",June 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/2,50
"This study investigates and compares five upstream petroleum fiscal systems under crude oil price uncertainty. The fiscal systems analyzed are: the Alberta Canada tax and royalty system, the Papua New Guinea (PNG) (pre-2003) traditional Rate of Return (ROR) system, the Sao Tome and Principe/Nigerian Joint Development Zone (SNJDZ) Production Sharing Contract (PSC), the Tanzanian PSC/ROR hybrid system and the Trinidad and Tobago PSC. Contingent claims analysis is used to value the governments’ tax claims under uncertainty using a numerical approach, viz., Monte Carlo simulation. Each system is tested to obtain the after-tax value accruing to firms as well as the distortionary effects introduced by the fiscal systems. The results are then ranked. The Alberta Canada and PNG fiscal systems provide companies with the highest after-tax values while also being the least distortionary. The Tanzanian system is the lowest in both rankings, providing relatively low after-tax values and introducing strong distortionary effects. The SNJDZ PSC imposed a relatively high tax burden on companies with median distortionary effects. The Trinidadian PSC generated a median tax burden on companies but has strong distortionary effects.","Volume 31, Issue 2",June 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/2,50
"There is consensus worldwide that the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector is comprised of individuals who are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty, lacking the necessary financial and technological means to improve their standards of living. Minimal work, however, has been undertaken to identify the very factors behind miners’ plight, which inevitably vary from country to country. This paper uses a case study of Ghana to argue that an increased dependence upon mercury for amalgamation in artisanal gold-mining communities is one such—albeit overlooked—“agent of poverty”. There is mounting empirical evidence which suggests that dealings with the monoponistic middlemen who supply mercury, purchases of costly medicines to remedy ailments caused by mercury poisoning, and a lack of appropriate safeguards and alternatives to amalgamation, are preventing gold miners from improving their practices and livelihoods. The solution to the problem lies in breaking this cycle of dependency, which can be achieved by providing miners with robust support services, mercury-free technologies and education.","Volume 31, Issue 2",June 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/2,50
"We develop a simple mechanism to explain why resource windfalls are likely to lower income levels in the long run. Most mineral-producing countries, in particular, fail to maintain incentives for savings and investment after positive resource shocks. Our analysis focuses on this savings–investment transmission channel through which resource rents affect welfare, and develops an OverLapping-Generations (OLG) model with features from endogenous growth theory to study the mechanism. In this model, savings adjust downwards to income from natural resources, investments adjust to savings, and subsequently the level of overall productivity falls. Resource affluence has two counteracting effects on income. In the short term, resource wealth augments income, but in the long-term, it decreases income through a crowding-out effect on knowledge creation.","Volume 31, Issue 2",June 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/2,50

The objective of this paper is to put on the map the sustainable technologies for electricity generation in Greece through the formulation of a collective interactive supportive framework, using an existing multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method to elaborate more realistic and transparent outcomes. The approach was implemented under the umbrella of the national Foresight Programme, to assist policy making for sustainable electricity generation technologies.","Volume 31, Issue 2",June 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/2,50
"Input–output modelling is a useful tool in policy analysis and economic planning. This methodology is used to detect the inter-industry linkages known as forward and backward linkages. Examination of these measures provides one mechanism for identifying “key” or “leading” sectors. The main objective of this paper is to measure the linkages of the mining and quarrying industry in the European Union (EU) and to determine if any of the industry subsectors can be considered key sectors. The paper shows that three subsectors can be considered key sectors: the mining of coal and lignite and extraction of peat in Germany; mining of metal ores in Sweden; and other mining and quarrying in Austria, Denmark and Spain. These sectors are more stimulated by overall industry growth than other sectors and have greater impacts in terms of investment expenditures on the national economy than other sectors. The values of the forward and backward linkages show that the mining and quarrying is an industry that would be stimulated by an increase in a regional economy's production more than other sectors, while an increase in the mining and quarrying industry's output would not stimulate this regional economy more than an increase in other sectors.","Volume 31, Issue 1",March 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/1,51
"This paper examines cointegration and Granger causality between steel consumption and economic growth in India for the time span of 1951–1952 to 2003–2004 in a bivariate vector autoregression format. Augmented Dickey–Fuller tests reveal that both series, after logarithmic transformation, are non-stationary and individually integrated of order one. This study finds the absence of cointegration but the existence of unidirectional Granger causality running from economic growth to steel consumption. Thus, a growth in income is found to be responsible for a higher level of steel consumption. The impulse response function divulges that GDP growth does not seem to be responsive due to a shock in steel consumption growth. Finally, this study forecasts steel demand in India till 2011–2012 and highlights the preparedness of the Indian steel industry along with required policy prescriptions to meet this demand.","Volume 31, Issue 1",March 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/1,51
"South Africa has developed niche competencies around the extraction and processing of mineral resources. Firms involved in the manufacture and supply of inputs to mining and mineral processing represent a key source of competitive advantage upon which future growth and development in the country can be planned. Drawing on a qualitative and quantitative study of 678 supplier firms conducted in 2004, this paper presents an assessment of the state of the South African minerals inputs cluster. The various demand and supply relationships, dynamics, and growth opportunities within the cluster are highlighted and the threats affecting the cluster's future competitiveness reviewed. The interventions needed to overcome and/or enhance them are also identified.","Volume 31, Issue 1",March 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/1,51
"A common pattern equation for the production of metals over their entire life is proposed. The equation is tested for five metals namely: copper, aluminum, lead, molybdenum and tungsten which have distinctly different historical spans. Various stages of early and take-off growth are identified and labeled stages I–IV. The very early stage of growth leading to a diminishing in activity appears to be decoupled from the later high growth stages. An approximately 12 year perturbation life cycle is noted in stage III for most metals. Copper and aluminum are not yet in stage IV, nor show any signs of entering this stage in the next 50 years. The pattern equation appears to have generality. A strict interpretation of the various parameters in the pattern equation is not attempted in this article.","Volume 31, Issue 1",March 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/1,51
"This article presents changes in apparent consumption of steel in Poland in the years 1974–2003. Sudden changes in Polish steel consumption and intensity of steel use in the period of consideration are characteristic of changes in all countries of Central-Eastern Europe. They were tied to a process of transformation from a centrally controlled economy into a market-oriented economy. Particular analyses were made of changes in intensity of steel use in Poland in the years 1992–2003 in sectors of the economy determining the steel consumption. Forecasts for the sector indicators of intensity of steel use were made for the next 5 years. They were utilised in preparing a steel consumption forecast for Poland till the year 2008. The forecast indicates that growth in steel consumption is to be expected from about 8350 thousand tonnes in the year 2003 to about 9520 thousand tonnes in the year 2008. This growth in consumption will accompany a small decrease of the intensity of steel use. For estimation of the regression equations used in the forecast, actual data obtained for the years 1992–2003 was applied. This was a period where the rules of a market economy affected the consumption of steel in Poland. Indicators of steel consumption and also total GDP shares in considered sectors indicated permanent trends of changes over the period.","Volume 31, Issue 1",March 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/1,51
"The objective of this paper is to develop a general pricing model for Turkish Lignite, which is mainly sold to thermal plants. This model will contribute to the development of coal mining within the scope of privatization efforts of the Turkish energy market. The paper consists of two stages. First, data of 10 thermal plants have been evaluated by using hedonic pricing analysis to determine influential price parameters. The results of hedonic regression analysis indicate the effect and importance of calorific value and electricity price on lignite prices. Second, a general coal-pricing model has been developed by taking into account the results of hedonic analysis. Comparison of the coal prices estimated by the developed pricing model and the coal prices obtained from thermal plants indicates an acceptable relation.","Volume 31, Issue 1",March 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/1,51
"Three major commodity booms since the second world war are identified and analyzed. In all three, demand shocks predominated as triggers to the commodity price rises. The first boom, in 1950–51, was caused by the massive inventory buildup in response to the Korean war. The second, in 1973–74, was accentuated by widespread harvest failures and by OPEC's market management, which tripled the price of oil. The third boom started in 2004 and has not yet run its course. This time, the explosive growth of China's and India's raw materials demand has played a key role. The first two booms collapsed as the world economy went into recession and excessive inventories were sold out. The third boom may prove more durable since the world economy continues to expand briskly and commodity inventories have remained small.","Volume 31, Issue 1",March 2006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/31/issue/1,51
"We present a simple dynamic model to get some key insights about the substitution of renewable for nonrenewable resources and the consequences for sustainability. We highlight the role of the elasticity of substitution (technological component) to determine the adjustment of production as a response to scarcity and growing ability of resources (environmental component). In some cases, the model predicts a smooth substitution of renewable for nonrenewable resources, but this process could work in the opposite direction if renewable resources are temporarily beyond their maximum sustainable yield, so that their marginal natural growth is negative. If substitution possibilities are high enough, it may be optimal to suspend the extraction of a resource to allow the biomass to regenerate. A production process is more likely to be sustainable the more heavily it depends on renewable, rather than nonrenewable resources.","Volume 30, Issue 4",December 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/4,52
"US Federal law mandates that mined land be returned by mine operators to a condition capable of supporting its pre-mining use or a higher use. Previously forested lands have commonly been reclaimed to hayland/pasture or wildlife habitat, and most of these lands have been abandoned from management and rendered non-productive. This situation has left landowners in the position of converting these reclaimed mined lands to forests at a later date, if they choose to make them economically productive. Such land-use conversion, however, comes with a substantial up-front cost to the landowner, which makes the financial viability of such a conversion questionable. We examine the financial viability of reforestation of these previously reclaimed mine lands by calculating land expectation value (LEV) under a range of conditions that include forest type, site quality, and reforestation intensity. We find that conversion to white pine is viable on higher quality sites under low to moderate interest rates with low or high timber prices, but conversion to mixed hardwoods is only profitable under the high price scenario with low interest rates, and only on higher quality sites. We also consider the implications of a shift in reforestation burden from the landowner to the mine operator, and results suggest that including costs of reforestation as part of the mining operation creates a financially viable forest enterprise for landowners under all scenarios for both white pine and mixed hardwoods. Two forms of carbon payments that could encourage reforestation of previously reclaimed mined lands also are examined: an annual payment based upon the total accumulated carbon found on-site in a given year, and an annual payment based on only the increment of carbon storage each year. Our carbon payment results indicate that annual values of up to $5.17 per ton of carbon stored in hardwoods and $9.39 per ton of carbon stored in pines would be required to make reforestation profitable under the poorest conditions (high interest rates, low prices, and poor quality site) when the payment is based on accumulated on-site carbon, although lower values are required under more favorable scenarios. Payments that are based upon the annual increment of carbon must fall in the range of $8.66–$71.88 per ton of carbon stored in hardwoods and $0–$83.29 per ton of carbon stored in pines to make reforestation financially viable.","Volume 30, Issue 4",December 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/4,52
"This article revisits global projections made in 1981 of eight metallic and fertilizer minerals for the year 2000. The principal objectives of the present study are to quantify the differences between the projected and observed levels of consumption for the year 2000 for eight of the 26 non-fuel minerals covered in the earlier study, and, then, to attempt to attribute these (often) large differences to the major determinants of minerals demand: income, technological, regulatory and other public policy changes, and changes in the recycling rates of the metallic minerals. The eight minerals are: aluminum, copper, iron, mercury, nickel, phosphate rock, potash and tin.This follow-up study begins with a discussion of the need for long-term projections of minerals. This section also includes a summary of the major determinants of the long-term demand for, and supply of, minerals, and a review of some of the earlier assessments of mineral needs and availability.Section 3 of the article begins with a short summary of the World Input–Output Model, the main methodological tool used in the earlier study that was developed by Prof. Wassily Leontief, the 1973 Nobel laureate in economics, and the way in which non-fuel minerals were represented in that system. This section also provides a summary of other global modeling efforts of non-fuel minerals that were carried out at a similar point in time for a similar interval.Section 4 presents the actual population, GDP and per capita GDP changes over the 1970–2000 time interval compared with the projected rates for these important determinants of mineral use, along with the projected and observed growth rates of minerals consumption for the eight non-fuel minerals included in this study. When the projections are compared to the observed global consumption rates for the year 2000, the differences range from +43% for nickel to +229% for potash.Section 5 discusses the apparent reasons for the differences between the projected and observed global consumption rates of these non-fuel minerals that include differences in the growth of GDP and GDP per capita, changes in recycling rates (for the metallic minerals), technological change, and regulatory or other public policy changes that have affected mineral use over the 30-year-interval ending in 2000.In light of the data and analysis presented in Projected versus observed rates of growth in the production and consumption of selected minerals for the year 2000, Explaining the differences between the projected and observed levels of consumption of non-fuel minerals in the year 2000, the article concludes with some remarks, made almost a quarter of a century ago, by Prof. Leontief on the need and justification for long-term projections.","Volume 30, Issue 4",December 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/4,52
"The real option valuation method is often presented as an alternative to the traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) approach because it is able to quantify the additional asset value arising from flexible asset management. However, these two valuation methods differ on a more fundamental level: their approach to determining the effects of cash flow uncertainty on asset value. Real option valuation adjusts for risk within the cash flow components while the DCF method discounts for risk at the aggregate net cash flow. This seemingly small difference allows the real option method to differentiate assets according to their unique risk characteristics, while the conventional DCF approach cannot.This paper presents an overview of the real options and conventional DCF frameworks for valuing uncertain cash flows. To emphasize the approaches' different treatment of risk we assume an absence of managerial flexibility. Using simple algebra, this paper demonstrates that the traditional DCF method fails to adequately discount net cash flow risk, no matter what discount rate is used. Finally, in a stylized mining example we show that DCF rules would lead a developer to forego $24.5 million in value creation, at a profitability index of 1.49, by making a poor investment decision.","Volume 30, Issue 4",December 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/4,52
"Ghana is the second largest producer of gold in sub-Saharan Africa, and has experienced a significant increase in national mining production over the last two decades. Between 1983 and 1998, the mining industry brought approximately US $4 billion in foreign direct investment to Ghana. While large-scale gold mining has seen a significant increase, artisanal gold and diamond mining product have grown exponentially. While much research has been conducted on gold mining in Ghana, there is relatively little research on the environmental and human development consequences of diamond mining in the country. Unlike other West African countries such as Sierra Leonne and Liberia, small-scale diamond mining in Ghana has not been linked to conflict but its role in development has also been relatively modest. This paper examines large and small-scale mining in Ghana's largest diamond mining town, Akwatia, and their relative impact on environmental degradation, health, and the livelihood of artisanal miners. We conclude that while an increase in artisanal diamond mining has been a means of employement and income-generation for small-scale miners, there are some human development challenges, related to environmental burden from land degradation and health. GCD is an ailing mining company in Ghana, in desperate need of an injection of capital to keep the mine alive, but botched bidding has slowed the process of de-regulating the company. We also conclude that the de-regulation of GCD may lead to a relatively reduced environmental burden in Akwatia and more revenue for the GCD to invest in the human development needs of communities in the town.","Volume 30, Issue 3",September 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/3,53
"Mining represents one of the most hazardous work environments. Health and safety standards tend to vary across countries, depending on the state of infrastructures, technological development, and exploration and development priorities within the sector. Following an overview of hypotheses on work accident exposure and related earnings differentials, the analysis examines the rationale for testing some of these hypotheses through alternative panel data models, by eventually accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, weak exogeneity and persistence. Regressions are estimated on an unbalanced panel of 12 industrial and developing economies. Factors related to the local economy and institutional background, are found to explain varying levels of the two dependent variables across time and space. Mine fatal injury exposure appears to decline with increasing levels of development and higher private investment rates. Earnings differentials with other sectors tend to widen with a large mining sector and high rates of unemployment. The hypothesis that differentials in gross earnings in mining relative to other economic sectors are also determined by increased fatal accident risk is not substantiated by econometric estimates.","Volume 30, Issue 3",September 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/3,53
"Examination of copper, nickel, lead and zinc (base metals) exploration expenditure and discovery in Australia over the period 1976–2005 reveals some significant trends. Australia's base metal resource inventory grew substantially as a consequence of successful exploration over the period, both through addition of resources at known deposits and new discoveries, notably a small number of very large deposits that underpin the resource base. In 2005, Australia had the world's largest economic demonstrated resources (EDR) of nickel, lead and zinc, and the second largest EDR of copper. Growth in nickel resources has been especially strong owing to discovery of large laterite resources in the late 1990s. Resource life, in average terms based on current EDR and production, is approximately 30 years for lead and zinc, 40 years for nickel sulphide (120 years for all nickel EDR) and 50 years for copper. Despite this success, major increases in production over the period (copper, nickel and zinc output increasing 3–4 fold, lead output doubling) and a fall in discovery rates during much of the 1990s means that resource life for lead and zinc is lower and nickel sulphide comparable now to that in 1976; only the resource life of copper has grown substantially over the period. Current published ore reserves are sufficient for at least 15 years operations at current production levels, but only a small number of the largest deposits currently being mined are likely to still be in production in 20 years. However, several mines have substantial inferred resources that may allow production beyond current mine reserves and there is a substantial number of undeveloped deposits that may provide the foundation for extended or new mining operations. The discovery record is strongly cyclical with resource growth for all the base metals punctuated by the discovery of giant (world-class) deposits each decade: these underpin current and future production. Recent higher metal prices and renewed interest in base metals, especially nickel, has reversed a 10 year decline in base metal exploration attended by reduced rates of discovery and resulted in record expenditure, new nickel, copper and zinc discoveries, and increased resources at a number of existing deposits, notably the Olympic Dam copper–uranium–gold deposit. With the exception of the Prominent Hill copper–gold and West Musgrave nickel–copper deposits, most of the recent discoveries, especially zinc (-lead) deposits, are of small tonnage (some of high grade). Nevertheless, these new discoveries have helped stimulate further exploration and also highlight the potential for further discoveries in little-explored provinces, especially those under regolith and shallow sedimentary cover.","Volume 30, Issue 3",September 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/3,53
"This paper examines the effectiveness of time-varying bivariate GARCH and GARCH-X determined hedge ratios for six non-ferrous metals cash-futures portfolios against time-invariant alternatives. The results suggest that the GARCH-X model, which incorporates the (squared) short-run deviation from a long-run cointegrating relationship in the conditional variance and covariance equations, provides the most effective hedge in five of the six cases. Thus, the results presented here strongly support the view that incorporating time-variation into the hedge ratio improves the performance of the hedge in terms of risk reduction.","Volume 30, Issue 3",September 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/3,53

"Botswana's mineral policy objective is primarily to maximize the national economic benefit from the development of mineral resources. In 1999, the government replaced the old mining code of 1977, which was out of tune with prevailing economic philosophies with a new mining code. Although, the old act had its shortcomings it served the country reasonably well for 20 years, during which time the country was transformed from being one of the poorest of the world's poor to a middle income country. One of the cornerstones of the new and old mining codes is that government does not subscribe to privately owned minerals rights. The Botswana government attempts to provide a fair balance between the various stakeholders. There are, however, areas in the mineral policy and mining codes that need to be critically reviewed as outlined in this paper.","Volume 30, Issue 3",September 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/3,53
"The international price for metals is pivotal in the profitability equation for mining companies. If producer prices rise, assuming production levels and costs remain the same, profits are expected to increase. Accordingly, producers welcome any means by which price instability and unpredictability can be reduced. The paper analyses the ability of two user-friendly time series forecasting techniques to predict future lead and zinc prices. The conclusion is that price forecasting is difficult. It should, however, be acknowledged that whilst neither of the two models are definitive, they are useful for the mining company vis-à-vis its planning process. In particular, the results from the analysis in this paper suggest that ARIMA modelling provides marginally better forecast results than lagged forward price modelling. The methodologies employed in this paper have a broad based application to base metal forecasting by mining companies in general, that is, the applications are transferable.","Volume 30, Issue 3",September 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/3,53

"Growth studies show, counter to intuition, that the discovery of a natural resource may be a curse rather than a blessing since resource-rich countries grow slower than others. But it has been suggested that the curse will not afflict rich countries and that, e.g. Norway is an exception to the curse. This article addresses both issues, and introduces a new diagnostic test. Neighbor countries Denmark and Sweden are used to highlight Norway's relative development and to test for curse presence. I employ a structural break technique to demonstrate that Norway started an acceleration in the early 1970s, after having discovered oil in 1969, and did not experience a pronounced retardation for the next 25 years. Instead, after first catching-up with its neighbors, Norway maintained a higher pace of growth. Norway might have escaped the curse. However, data suggest a slow-down at the end of the period, opening the possibility of a late onset of the curse. If so, rich countries are not immune.","Volume 30, Issue 2",June 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/2,54
"The reform of previously state-owned and operated industries in many Less Developed Countries (LDCs) provide contrary experiences to those in the developed world, which have generally had more equitable distributional impacts. The economic reform policies proposed by the so-called ‘Washington Consensus’ state that privatisation provides governments with opportunities to raise revenues through the sale of under-performing and indebted state industries, thereby reducing significant fiscal burdens, and, at the same time, facilitating influxes of foreign capital, skills and technology, with the aim of improving operations and a ‘trickle-down’ of benefits. However, experiences in many LDCs over the last 15–20 years suggest that reform has not solved the problem of chronic public-sector debt, and that poverty and socio-economic inequalities have increased during this period of ‘neo-liberal’ economics. This paper does not seek to challenge the policies themselves, but rather argues that the context in which reform has often taken place is of fundamental significance. The industry-centric policy advice provided by the IFIs typically causes a ‘lock-in’ of inequitably distributed ‘efficiency gains’, providing minimal, if any, benefits to impoverished groups. These arguments are made using case study analysis from the electricity and mining sectors.","Volume 30, Issue 2",June 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/2,54

"An analysis using reserves as a measure of resource abundance suggests that natural resource abundance has not been a significant structural determinant of economic growth in the seventies and eighties. The story behind the effect of natural resources on economic growth is a complex one that typical growth regressions do not capture well. Preliminary evidence suggests that natural resources may affect economic growth through both ‘positive’ and ‘negative channels.’ Potential reverse causality running from these ‘channels’ to fuel and mineral reserves further complicates the analysis. I conjecture that, as economic historians suggest, the ability of a country to exploit its resource base depends critically on the nature of the learning process involved.","Volume 30, Issue 2",June 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/2,54
"Examining the production and consumption for copper between 1985 and 2003, we see two dramatic changes. The first is the rapid growth of consumption in China and other Asian countries, the second the rapid growth of production in Chile. This paper examines these two important developments, which nicely accommodated each other, allowing the global copper market to remain more or less in balance over this period. A better understanding of the forces responsible for both, it is hoped, will allow us to understand better whether they are likely to continue in the future in a manner that provides a rough balance between global consumption and the available production.","Volume 30, Issue 2",June 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/2,54
"During the production of an oil and gas reservoir the common pool problem asserts itself as multiple users have the right to withdraw hydrocarbons from the same source of supply. Unitization offers a private contractual solution to this problem. Texas and Oklahoma have both adopted legislation enabling the formation of unit operating agreements that allow for a private contractual solution to the common pool resource problem. Intriguingly Oklahoma has adopted the most liberal unitization statute of any major oil producing state and Texas the most restrictive. The difference between Texas and Oklahoma has traditionally been explained by assessing the relative influence of majors and independents in the two states at the time the legislation was adopted. However, this explanation while no doubt partially valid does not tell the complete story. An examination of land tenure patterns in the two states and an analysis of field characteristics from a random sample taken from each state indicates that the Oklahoma may have been facing a far greater problem in regard to the fracturing of the mineral estate and thus a more drastic solution was required.","Volume 30, Issue 1",March 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/1,55
"It is generally considered that the non-renewable nature of mineral resources will make them gradually depleted over time. However, in the perspective of development availability of mineral resources in a long-term depends not only on their currently available amounts but also on future potential mineral resources (e.g. those undiscovered and low-grade ores) and substitutive renewable resources. In addition, it is influenced by factors like technology and capital. These factors interact with each other. As a result, it is possible to make the sustainable development of mineral resources by appropriate coordination between these factors. A new concept of Degree of Sustainable Development of Mineral Resources (DSDMR) and its conceptual model are proposed in this paper in the viewpoints of system science and sustainable development to evaluate the ability of sustainable development of mineral resources for a mining city. DSDMR refers to the ability of meeting needs of present and future generations for mineral resources by their logical distribution and substitution. An indicator system and a fuzzy integrated judgment model, which involve factors of resources, economy, society, environments and intelligence, are presented. They are used to evaluate DSDMR of Huangshi city, which is the most ancient and yet one of the most important mining cities producing iron and copper in China.","Volume 30, Issue 1",March 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/1,55
"Between 1960 and 2000, Japan's real GDP grew 620%. However, its consumption of copper increased only 345%, thanks to a 38% decline in the country's intensity of copper use. In light of concerns today over the possible impact of future economic development in China, India, and other developing countries on the long-run availability of mineral resources, this study proposes to explore the causes for this dramatic decline in the Japanese intensity of copper use.For some time, we have known that the intensity of metal use within a country depends on its level of economic development, usually measured by per capita income, as well as on technological change, long-run price trends, and other factors whose influence varies, more or less, with time. This study finds that rising per capita income has increased the intensity of copper use in Japan over the entire period examined. Moreover, this positive effect is expected to continue until per capita income—$44,830 in 2000—reaches $53,000. Thereafter, further advances will tend to reduce the intensity of copper use. Conversely, new copper-saving technologies and other time-related variables have on average reduced the intensity of copper use by 2.9% a year, an amount sufficient not only to offset the positive effects of growing per capita income but also to reduce intensity of use by 38%.","Volume 30, Issue 1",March 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/1,55
"The Australian gold industry has grown enormously over the past 25 years. Australian mine production of gold in 2003 was 284 t, similar to that of the USA, and behind South Africa, the world's largest gold-producing nation. Gold is Australia's third largest commodity export, worth an estimated A$5.3 billion in 2003–2004.Underpinning the industry is a solid resource base that has grown by successful exploration over the past three decades. Australia ranks third in the world after South Africa and the USA in terms of its economic gold resources. The growth in Australia's gold resources has been underpinned by high levels of exploration and innovations in gold processing technologies, specifically the development of carbon-based gold extraction methods that allowed commercial treatment of low grade ores. It has been supported by advances in gold exploration methods, especially exploration geochemistry.New resources were added at existing deposits and new deposits were found, including several of world class (>100 t contained gold), in each decade over the 25-year-period but resource growth since the 1990s has been dominated by brownfields additions rather than new discoveries. Average costs of discovery have now plateauxed at around A$20–25/oz, after falling sharply during the early to mid-1990s when a number of new discoveries were made, notably in the Yandal belt in Western Australia and the Lachlan Fold Belt in New South Wales. Current gold reserve/production and gold EDR/production ratios are 12 and 19 years, respectively, and indicate that the long-term future of the Australian gold industry depends on continued high levels of exploration and the discovery of new deposits to replace mines that are currently being depleted.","Volume 30, Issue 1",March 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/1,55
"In 1998, China launched a programme to close tens of thousands of small-scale coal mines within just three years. Few measures were put in place to mitigate the negative impacts. This paper reports on a study in the Chongqing Municipality of south-west China, with the aims of identifying the economic impacts of the mine closure campaign and examining what factors permitted some localities to respond more successfully to the resulting economic challenges. Those areas with greater wealth and more diversified economies were able to absorb the shock of mine closure more effectively than poorer areas and those with less diversified economies. These latter groups either failed to respond to mine closure or reacted by increasing output from the remaining mines. In the successful cases, though the economy of the area as a whole was able to withstand the impact of the mine closure campaign, no evidence was found of any attempts to assist those in the local communities directly affected by mine closure.","Volume 30, Issue 1",March 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/1,55
"Studies by Nutting, Jacobson and Evans and Georgentalis et al. have all concluded, using panel data sets, that a number of metals appear to share a common demand curve that is stable over time. However, these studies have a number of theoretical and econometric limitations. This paper addresses these concerns and reassesses the hypothesis that some metals share such a common demand curve with the same price elasticity of demand. This is achieved within the framework of a random coefficients model. This model was applied to a dynamic metals demand function (DLR) and various estimation techniques were used including OLS, IV, Empirical Bayes (EB) and Instrumental Variables Empirical Bayes (IV-EB). It was found that each metal had its own individual short run demand function with statistically different own price and industrial activity elasticities of demand. In the long run, each metal appeared to be equally unresponsive to price changes, but had different industrial activity elasticities. The speeds of price adjustment to periods of market disequilibrium differed substantially between metals.","Volume 30, Issue 1",March 2005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/30/issue/1,55
"In simple models, the cutoff grade has been shown to depend on the rate of growth of price net of the interest rate. But there is disagreement in the literature about whether the cutoff grade is positively or negatively related to this variable. In a model which involves two stages of production and a general grade distribution, we find that the rate of growth of price net of the interest rate has an influence, but that the sign of the effect is ambiguous because it depends on a complicated factor involving technical, mine-specific elasticities. This mine-specificity is consistent with the fact that engineering textbooks present the problem of optimal exploitation very simply, using a constant grade, and the fact that engineers use simulation in decision making. It also points to the possibility of moral hazard in exploitation, a possibility of potential concern to managers, shareholders and policy makers.","Volume 29, Issues 3–4",September–December 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/29/issue/3,56

"Existing approaches to modelling investment and implementation of technological progress in metal industries concentrate, mostly, on the investment process for new plants. Modernisation of existing plants is not modelled with the same degree of care. It is, however, the case that the upgrading of existing plants plays a decisive role in the implementation of technological progress and capacity expansion in metal industries. This paper develops an approach to making investment decisions that considers the upgrading of existing plants, as well as the building of new plants. The capability of the model is illustrated by using the example of the German primary aluminium industry.","Volume 29, Issues 3–4",September–December 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/29/issue/3,56
"This paper investigates the European Commission's decision to allow a merger between two Brazilian iron ore mining companies, CVRD and Caemi, using data on the Direct Reduced Iron pellet market. By using a simulation model, we can directly simulate the total welfare effects from the merger and hence evaluate the merger from a new perspective. The results from our simulations suggest that the welfare effects are negative from the merger between CVRD and Caemi, which supports the conclusion drawn by the European Commission decision. By performing different simulations between hypothetical merger candidates, our results show that only mergers between small candidates have the potential to be welfare enhancing.","Volume 29, Issues 3–4",September–December 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/29/issue/3,56

Through the concept of optimal levels of soil erosion, a conceptual model of the social costs of soil degradation is elaborated. The discussion focuses on the measurement aspects of the economic scarcity of soil in the agriculture sector. Reliable estimates of the true impacts of soil degradation can only be made if data on marginal damage costs and marginal conservation costs are available. The different scarcity indicators are evaluated and competitive land rental prices are considered as appropriate in indicating soil scarcity in agriculture.","Volume 29, Issues 3–4",September–December 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/29/issue/3,56
"The small-scale gold and diamonds mining industry is of great importance to Ghana. Since its regularization in 1989 the sector has produced and sold over 1.5 million troy ounces of gold and 8.0 million carats of diamonds. During the same period the sector also provided direct employment to over 100,000 people and improved the socioeconomic life of many individuals and communities. However, these were largely achieved at a cost to the environment in areas where mining is carried out and there is the need to develop the industry in a sustainable manner. This paper looks at the developments in the small-scale gold and diamonds mining industry in Ghana and proposes some strategies on how the concepts of sustainable development could be applied to the industry.","Volume 29, Issues 3–4",September–December 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/29/issue/3,56
"The aim of this paper is to review the progress made so far in liberalizing the mining sector in India and to flag important aspects that still need attention. It is argued that successful liberalisation of the mining sector is contingent upon the liberalisation of the coal sector, which is the largest mining sector and is still being effectively controlled. Only after the liberalisation of the coal sector, larger private participation could be feasible, which in turn would reduce the cost of production and improve efficiency by introducing the state of the art technologies. The liberalisation of the coal sector is also important from the point of view of growing energy needs of India.","Volume 29, Issues 3–4",September–December 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/29/issue/3,56

"This paper estimates the true economic income for the Chilean mining sector, using the welfare foundations for the usual net domestic product (NDP) income measure of the traditional National Accounts System (NAS) provided by [Weitzman, M., 1976.

The total depletion of natural capital caused by mining is calculated by estimating, on the one hand, the depreciation of resources (using the net price approach) and, on the other, the environmental costs provoked by mining activity. The results show that, correcting the usual GDP measure for man-made capital depreciation plus the total loss of natural capital, the standard mining GDP measure of the NAS overestimates by 31–36% the economic income generated by Chile's mining sector during the period 1985–1996.","Volume 29, Issues 3–4",September–December 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/29/issue/3,56
"With the continually declining percentage of soft drink sales in refillable bottles in favour of cans and PET bottles, despite a growing soft drink market, governments have become increasingly concerned with the alleged more environmentally harmful impacts of throw-away convenience packaging and tried to enact policies to induce consumers to switch to refillable glass bottles. In many cases, fully or partially refundable deposits have been opted for to provide consumers with the incentive to properly dispose of packaging, but not to switch between different container types, and thus, they may not constitute the most desirable solution. The effects of various regulatory measures on producers’ choices of packaging quality and mix in the presence of consumers with differing demand intensities are analyzed to discern the least distortionary alternative.","Volume 29, Issues 1–2",March–June 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/29/issue/1,57

"Since gaining independence Algeria has made two unsuccessful attempts at integration into the world economy. The first entailed forced industrialization. It used the windfall rents from the 1974–78 and 1979–81 oil booms to accelerate the process. However, the outcome conforms to the staple trap model: the resource rents consolidated a non-developmental political state, which repressed markets, misallocated capital and rendered the economy vulnerable to a growth collapse. The collapse duly occurred when oil rents fell in the late-1980s. The second attempt at global integration was driven by international financial institution (IFI)-backed reforms in the 1990s. It stabilized the economy but achieved insufficient economic restructuring to boost GDP growth to the level required to curb unemployment, which doubled to 30% of the workforce. These two failed attempts have left a legacy of formidable political opposition to economic reform. Therefore, this paper argues that Algeria’s third attempt at global integration should use the country’s still substantial oil rents to support gradual (dual track) reform, which creates a dynamic market sector that pulls surplus labor from the lagging politicized sector. The key attraction of gradual reform is that it lowers the political risk of restructuring because the gainers from reform can compensate the losers.","Volume 29, Issues 1–2",March–June 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/29/issue/1,57

"The burning of fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially CO2, possibly causing climate change. Environmentally friendly energy development has enormous implications for developing countries as major emitters due to their rapid economic and population growth. This paper presents an overview of developing countries in their efforts to reduce GHG emissions by reforming energy pricing, promoting energy efficiency, and using renewable energy sources. Then the paper focuses on the challenges facing developing countries, such as contradictory objectives, unrealistic emission standards and rigid incentives, and public environmental unawareness. With some possible options, the paper concludes that the reduction of emissions can only be achieved when policies are supportive and well targeted, standards and incentives are realistic and flexible, and the public is actively responsive to environmental degradation.","Volume 29, Issues 1–2",March–June 2003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/29/issue/1,57
"Technology is viewed to advance through a series of cycles, starting with the emergence of a major breakthrough, followed by a period of ferment as alternate designs and improvements rapidly appear, leading to a dominant design, and then a long plateau period of minor incremental change. In this paper, the technology cycle model is applied to the history of solvent extraction electrowinning (SX-EW) processing of copper ore, which, along with other innovations, has transformed the US copper mining industry. The general framework of the technology cycle model holds, although there are differences relating to the specific nature of SX-EW processing.One particularly interesting difference is that SX-EW initially was complementary to the original method of ore processing, known as flotation. Only in recent years has it directly challenged flotation in the processing of supergene or transitional ore. In addition, the analysis shows that the SX-EW process helped the US producers maintain their competitiveness for at least a decade before the process was widely adopted by their main competitors, the Chilean producers. This raises questions about the widely held assumption that research and development of new innovations can provide firms and countries with little or no competitive advantage because new technologies diffuse very rapidly in today’s global economy.","Volume 28, Issues 3–4",September–December 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/28/issue/3,58
"Previous studies have identified a single, stable and strong correlation between the price of metals and their consumption, such that low priced metals are always used in large amounts and visa versa. Some have interpreted this as evidence that metals share a common demand curve so that a single price elasticity of demand exists. This paper reviews and tests this hypothesis against a number of other possible explanations, including the idea that the relationship is an empirical curiosity. Modifications to the demand curve were tested by allowing metals to have different intercepts and price elasticities. The results from this analysis suggest that metals do not share a common demand curve and that the correlation identified between the price of metals and their level of consumption is an empirical curiosity. As such, the singular price elasticities published in past papers should not be used for assessing future rates of metals substitution.","Volume 28, Issues 3–4",September–December 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/28/issue/3,58
"In India, the mineral resource inventory and the production of a large number of important minerals have registered significant increases during the last few decades. Yet the country continues to be a net importer of many high value and scarce minerals and metals, like gold, diamond, and several base metals. Exploration and development of the resources of these minerals are technology- and capital-intensive. To bring technology and capital through foreign direct investment (FDI) into the Indian mineral sector, it is imperative to lay stress on: accurate resource estimation and categorization, as well as realistic projection of the true values; rationalization of legislative measures based on R&D studies and reorganization of the implementation machinery; conducive tax structure; notification of acts and rules applicable to offshore mineral resources; time-frames for granting licences and leases; encouragement to labor productivity by rationalizing labor laws; reforms in the monetary system to increase market competitiveness of Indian minerals; and judicial reforms. FDI in the Indian mineral sector is important to firm up the knowledge-base of mineral resources and their optimum exploitation.","Volume 28, Issues 3–4",September–December 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/28/issue/3,58

"In this paper, the exploitation of petroleum resources in India is analyzed by developing a dynamic optimization modeling framework—PETEX. This model combines the practical aspects in determining optimal rates of extraction of oil and gas from a reservoir with a hybrid approach to estimating the discovery rate of petroleum resources in the future, additionally incorporating a stochastic specification to capture the uncertainty associated with discovery. The model acts as an aid to joint production–investment decision making for the entire supply process from drilling through production and in determining the import requirement to meet the country’s oil demand. The model results and sensitivity analysis suggest an acute requirement of sustained infusion of investment into the various upstream activities at a rate much higher than the current levels in order to bridge the demand—supply gap for crude oil. With the opening up of the Indian economy, it is hoped that the participation of the private sector in upstream activities would increase thereby increasing the investments available for upstream activity.","Volume 28, Issues 3–4",September–December 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/28/issue/3,58
"In this study, a model to estimate the optimum mine size is developed. The model is developed on the basis of marginal analysis. The model solves for the production rate at which the present value of marginal costs equals the present value of marginal revenues—the rate that microeconomic theory shows will maximize the net present value of production from the mine.In addition, the article discusses the effects on the optimum production rate of: the physical characteristics of the deposit, economic factors, and financial factors. It has been found that, not surprisingly, as the reserve tonnage increases, the optimum mine size increases. Also, the optimum production rate increases as the ore grade increases. A direct relationship has been found between the mineral price and the optimum production rate. The optimum mine size is found to be inversely related to the expected growth rate of mineral price, while it is directly related to the expected growth rate of mining costs. A concave relationship has been found between the cost of capital and the optimum mine size.","Volume 28, Issues 3–4",September–December 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/28/issue/3,58

"This paper is motivated by the observation that although both the Australian and British governments have imposed resource rent taxes (RRTs) on their petroleum industries, these taxes have different structures, with the British form featuring both a higher threshold rate-of-return on capital above which tax is payable (r), and a higher rate of tax for these excess profits (t), than the Australian form. The analysis in the paper finds that the revenue-generating performance of alternatively structured RRTs depends both on the profit margin on extracted resource and on the riskiness of the resource deposit. Hence no single structure is superior in all situations, although a low r, t pair is better if profit margins and riskiness are low, while a high r, t pair is better if these factors are high. It is suggested that the choice of RRT structure should be conditional on an ex ante evaluation of these factors.","Volume 28, Issues 1–2",March–June 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/28/issue/1,59
"This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the effects of temporal controls on the stochastic behavior of renewable natural resources such as fisheries and rangelands. First, we show that temporal resource management is characterized by the existence of a threshold effect. Second, we point out that in the presence of environmental uncertainty, the ability of a manager to move a resource to a desirable state depends on the magnitude of the effect that the temporal control has on the state of the resource. Third, we show that if this magnitude is below a critical threshold then it will be impossible for the manger to reach any desirable state of the resource in a finite amount of time. Finally, we solve an optimization problem from the standpoint of a resource manager. Our analysis of this problem shows that the proper course of action involves choosing the temporal control in a way so that the resource is able to provide society with a flow of consumptive and non-consumptive services, and the persistence of the undesirable state is minimized.","Volume 28, Issues 1–2",March–June 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/28/issue/1,59
"This paper provides a concise historical account of gold mining in Ghana, from the pre-colonial period, through to the present. For over 1000 years, the Ancient Kingdom of Ghana, the former Gold Coast Colony, and present-day Ghana, have produced a substantial portion of the world’s gold. Initially frequented by Arab traders who had crossed vast stretches of the Sahara, the trading routes of the Ancient Kingdom of Ghana had stimulated significant conflict among groups, in particular, the Europeans, who, for centuries, battled for control of the West African gold monopoly. The region’s first gold mining companies were formed shortly after the British established the Gold Coast Colony in 1874, and, following two successive gold rushes in the early-1900s, gold prospecting and extraction were widespread in Obuasi, Tarkwa and Prestea. However, the industry soon entered a period of depressed production, which began at the time of country independence in 1957, and ended shortly after implementation of the country’s Economic Recovery (ERP) Plan in 1983. The Ghanaian gold mining industry has since grown rapidly, supplanting cocoa cultivation as the country’s chief economic activity. In the past 20 years, production increases in the order of 700% have been achieved, and today, output from resident gold mines accounts for some 37% of national exports and 97% of mineral exports.","Volume 28, Issues 1–2",March–June 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/28/issue/1,59
"The role that international trade plays in measuring sustainable development has come under recent scrutiny. We examine international resource flows using an input–output framework that is akin to ‘ecological balance of payments’ analysis. This framework allows us to use to calculate the derived demand for resources in the country of final use. The empirical section of this paper applies this model to data on global trade and natural resource depletion in 1980, 1985 and 1990. Our results provide a quantitative assessment of the significance of direct and indirect imports of resources required by Japan, the United States and the European Union. These results can also be disaggregated to permit an examination of trade relations vis-à-vis individual resource exporting countries. It is interesting to note that a number of these resource exporters appear to be unsustainable at least on the basis of the criterion that the savings rate net of asset consumption (i.e. genuine savings) should not be negative. These findings, in turn, could form the basis of policies to assist exporters in adopting prudent resource and public investment policies.","Volume 28, Issues 1–2",March–June 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/28/issue/1,59
"Material flows of concrete from construction and demolition (C&D) waste in Taiwan have grown considerably over the last two decades, Hsiao et al. (2001). This increased flow puts pressure on limited national disposal capacity and has indirectly caused ecological damage to domestic riparian zones used as sources of natural aggregate. Using existing statistics and literature sources for C&D waste generation in Taiwan we have developed a dynamic model of domestic material flows of concrete waste and employ statistical analyses to obtain projections of future material flows. Our major findings are: (1) Taiwan’s rate of waste concrete generation in 2001 for the residential and commercial construction industry was approximately 2.4 Million Metric Tons (MMT) per year, averaging 0.11 metric tons of waste concrete generated annually by each Taiwanese; (2) Around the year 2009, the national rate will more than triple to exceed the spike in C&D concrete waste generation that occurred after the Chi Chi earthquake 9/21/99, 8.5 MMT. (3) Aside from pilot-scale development of waste concrete utilization technology, nationwide recycling rates remain negligible. Without resource recovery, the volume of C&D waste generation by 2009 is projected to occupy nearly 7% of all existing and planned domestic landfill capacity. A target is established to raise resource recovery rates for waste concrete to 50% by 2005 and a 100% nationwide recycling rate by 2009.","Volume 28, Issues 1–2",March–June 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/28/issue/1,59
"In order to exploit their natural resources efficiently, states are normally obliged to rely on private mining companies (lessees), which in turn must rely on e.g. hired labour and different suppliers of equipment. This third party will try to exploit any negotiating power that might arise when the right to exploit the resource has been allocated to the lessee. If this succeeds, the size of the rent available to the resource owner and the lessee will be reduced. This paper focusses on rent sharing between the state, the lessee and labour under various combinations of ex ante and ex post rent taxation. In the paper it is shown that in a setting with affiliated values, cash bonus bidding combined with a royalty results in a double dividend: The state’s share of the pie increases and the wage pressure decreases. This result is of particular relevance to nations where the extractive sector represents a relatively large share of the economy.","Volume 28, Issues 1–2",March–June 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/28/issue/1,59
"The consumption pattern of seven major metals—steel, aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc—has frequently violated the law of demand in the late 20th century. This paper examines the patterns of the major metal consumption in the world and seven particular regions and analyzes the disarray of metals consumption. Divisia price–quantity covariance indexes report that the price and quantity consumed moved frequently in the same direction, and the elasticity approach shows that the own-price elasticities are extremely small and insignificant, while income elasticities are significant. However, considering the parameters that are crucial in determining the own-price elasticity, this paper concludes that the apparent disarray in metals consumption is not in fact real.","Volume 28, Issues 1–2",March–June 2002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/28/issue/1,59
"Resource-rich states throughout the developing world are prone to rent-seeking, excessive borrowing, wasteful spending, and unbalanced growth as well as states with weak institutions and authoritarian regimes. Are the five energy-rich Soviet successor states necessarily doomed to repeat this experience, often referred to as the “resource curse”? This paper advances and tests the hypothesis that Russia and Kazakhstan are more likely to avoid the “resource curse” than Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan because they privatized their energy sectors. Specifically, we find that privatization offers a potential path out of the “resource curse” when it involves a transfer of ownership to domestic actors. Although Kazakhstan initially appeared to be developing a viable tax regime in response to foreign investors, over the long term Kazakhstan’s tax regime has become increasingly volatile and dependent upon these foreign investors. In contrast, domestic oil companies are helping to foster the development of an increasingly viable tax regime in Russia.","Volume 27, Issue 4",December 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/4,60
"This study analyses the general-equilibrium impacts of an international climate change response policy on the economy of Western Australia (WA), one of the most mining-based and energy-intensive states of Australia. It finds that emissions would fall by up to 11% from the base level in WA. However, such environmental benefits emanate at some costs to the state economy; in terms of foregone gross state product, the costs are up to 3% of the base level. Indeed, the actual costs and benefits depend on the precise design of the climate change response policy as well as on the other policies within which it operates. For example, when emission quota permits are sold to industries and no tradeable carbon credits (i.e. credits for the carbon sequestrated in Kyoto forests) are granted, emissions decline by about 8% and GSP falls by about 3% of the base levels. If carbon credits are tradeable, however, the environmental benefits could be increased and the GSP cost could be reduced substantially. Also, the reduced economic activity caused by emission abatement results in a modest fall in net government revenue, despite the additional revenue from permit sales in some cases. Accordingly, government’s fiscal package surrounding the emission permits would influence the emission abatement impacts on the economy. With regard to the effects on the structure of the state economy, the oil and gas industry suffers only a slight contraction but the energy-supplying sector as a whole contracts substantially. It is therefore not surprising that the impacts on the WA economy of curbing emissions by energy and transport industries alone are quite significant when compared to those resulted from all industries’ compliance with the abatement scheme. It needs to be noted that the model projections analysed in the paper are based on simplifying assumptions and tentative scenarios, and hence should be viewed with caution and not be understood as unconditional forecasts.","Volume 27, Issue 4",December 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/4,60
"Many financial time series exhibit irregular behaviour. Economic theory suggests that this irregular behaviour might be due to the existence of nonlinear dependence in the markets. Thus, economic time series are governed by nonlinear dynamics.The purpose of this paper is to investigate price behaviour in the London Metal Exchange market. Thus, this study will test the two most attractive nonlinear models—long memory and chaos—on six metal commodities to ascertain which model is consistent with the observed metal price nonlinear dynamics.Application of long memory and chaos analysis provides new approaches for assessing the behaviour of metal prices. We identified, in tin, a case of chaos. Our empirical results in the case of aluminium support the long memory hypothesis. A short memory model explains the underlying processes of the nickel and lead returns series, while zinc returns reflect an anti-persistent process. To our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to apply long memory and chaos analysis in the evaluation of the behaviour of metal prices.","Volume 27, Issue 4",December 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/4,60

Yet facing increasing pressures of environmental sustainability and market transition, the Chinese government was forced to make deep reforms and adjustments to regulate the coal industry effectively. This paper presents an historical overview of China’s coal economic policies, paying particular attention to the current reform policy of closing mines and restricting the yield for the small coal mines (SCMs) in the context of economic theories and methods. We argue that the SCM closure policy would not likely be efficiently enforced if a feasible market mechanism were not built up. The failure of closure policy is due largely to problems of property rights, coal pricing, ownership, and objectives.","Volume 27, Issue 4",December 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/4,60
"In this paper we show that under double constraint the goods derived from secondary materials could be Giffen. The example is given of paper derived from waste recycling. We show that if the policy maker misunderstands the type of goods, because he incorrectly considers a Giffen good to be normal, the results of his economic policy could be opposite to his goals. Finally, we make some considerations to generalize our results, and suggest topics for further research.","Volume 27, Issue 4",December 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/4,60
"The use of futures in copper marketing became common during the 1990s, but little attention has been put on the reasons for it and its relationship with other elements of marketing such as forward sales and premiums. This study focuses on these issues and the benefit of futures relative to annual forward contracts. It argues futures complement annual forward contracts to secure the average market price rather than to maximize revenue. The paper analyzes empirical evidence for the six largest Chilean copper producers. This sample reflects well the entire Chilean industry during the 1990s. The analysis shows that forward sales became more volatile and futures seem to be the instrument to avoid income fluctuation at the end of the marketing process. However, the benefits of futures compared to forward sales are very modest. In the last section we suggest a better marketing instrument to maximize revenue may be premiums.","Volume 27, Issue 4",December 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/4,60
"This paper estimates the cost of the abatement of sulfur dioxide (SO2) for three copper smelters operating in Chile. It analyses compliance with emission goals and with the atmospheric health-based SO2 and breathable particle standards. The smelters are Chuquicamata, belonging to the State-owned company, Codelco; and Hernán Videla Lira and Ventanas belonging to ENAMI, the national mining company, also owned by the State. The marginal investment for abating 1 ton of sulfur in 1999 was estimated to be US$186 (1998) for Ventanas, and US$181 for Paipote. The average investment for abating 1 ton of sulfur to fully comply with the annual standard measured on average in these smelters, was estimated to be US$220 and US$170 for the Ventanas and Paipote smelters, respectively. These values are not far from the market value for SO2 transactions from stationary sources in the USA.","Volume 27, Issue 3",September 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/3,61
"The development of mining sciences in Europe is briefly discussed. It is argued that with the decline of the importance of mining in the major Western industrialised countries investment in mining research and education has decreased dramatically. Despite the continuing increase in the demand for minerals and the heavy dependence of Western economies on minerals, the responsibility for mineral production and the development of mining technology is being handed over to predominantly developing countries. These, however, do not have the background and necessary infrastructure to take over the responsibility for technology development. The dangers resulting from this development are highlighted.","Volume 27, Issue 3",September 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/3,61
"We examine the impact of the pricing regime on price variability with reference to the non-ferrous metals industry. Theoretical arguments are ambiguous, but suggest that the extent of monopoly power is more important than the pricing regime as a determinant of variability. Slade (Quart. J. Econ. 106 (1991) 1309) argued that metals price volatility increased in the 1980s relative to the 70s, and that this was associated with a move from administered producer pricing to exchange pricing. These claims are only partially supported. Extension of Slade's sample to the present indicates that any early differences between the variability of producer and exchange prices have now vanished.","Volume 27, Issue 3",September 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/3,61
"Considerable efforts have been devoted by econometric researchers to understanding Japanese steel mill (JSM) metallurgical coal valuation policies, and whether such policies disadvantage coal exporters. Much of this research has employed the hedonic regression modeling technique of Rosen [J. Polit. Econ. 2 (1974) 34] and examines the significance of coal quality in establishing market price. This article discusses shortcomings in some such modeling studies, and presents results of additional hedonic modeling to buttress findings of previous work suggesting that cross-cultural bargaining factors rather than coal quality explain lower prices for Australian coals in Japanese market settlements. Policy changes that might be effective in ameliorating bilateral market distortions arising from oligopsony characteristics exhibited in JSM contract settlements are then explored.","Volume 27, Issue 3",September 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/3,61
"This paper examines the conditional volatility of daily non-ferrous LME settlement prices over the period 1972–1995. Previous research has indicated that metals volatility, whilst stationary and therefore ultimately mean-reverting, is highly variable over time, possibly as the result of being conditioned by two broad factors. The first, common to all financial markets, relates to the impact of new market information and hedging or speculative pressures, which are typically short-run in nature. The second, more fundamental influence, is specific to commodity markets where stocks can become low, and is more medium to long-run in nature. This paper considers these factors in the context of an empirical model of conditional volatility which provides an explicit decomposition of volatility into its long-run and short-run components, and which is shown to be superior to the standard model of conditional volatility widely applied in modelling financial market volatility. On the basis of the reported model, we also provide further evidence on the conjecture that common factors may condition the long-run conditional volatility component. Our results confirm the relevance and significance of the decomposition of metals price volatility, and the presence of three separate principle components driving underlying metals volatility, one of which is common to all six of the metals considered. These findings carry practical implications for risk management, the hedging activities pursued by market participants, and for the pricing of derivative assets.","Volume 27, Issue 3",September 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/3,61
"The options to suspend production from an operating mine, reopen the mine, and abandon the mine are exercised according to definite decision rules based on the status of the price of the produced mineral. Because of the nonrenewable characteristic of the mineral assets, the threshold mineral prices for exercising these options depend on the remaining life of the mine, or the remaining amount of ore reserve. This paper aims to explain how to construct a decision scheme showing the dynamics of the threshold prices throughout the mine life. A case study is provided using the data of Red Lake gold mine, Northwest Ontario, Canada. The threshold price for exercising the suspending option at the early stages of production is found to be higher than that estimated near the end of the mine life. As the remaining life of the mine decreases, the threshold prices to reopen and abandon the mine increase.This paper also suggests a method to determine the maximum suspending period and explains its dependence on the remaining life of the mine. It is found that there is a direct relationship between the maximum suspending period and the remaining life of the mine. As the remaining life of the mine decreases, the maximum suspending period decreases.","Volume 27, Issue 3",September 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/3,61
"With the inception of an Economic Recovery Programme (ERP) by the government in 1983, Ghana's minerals and mining sector has seen a major resurgence over the past one and a half decades. To study the contribution of the sector to the national economy, this paper analyses the results of a survey of the contribution of 12 of 16 large scale mines operating in Ghana by the end of 1998 and also reviews the contribution of the sector as a whole to certain key national economic indicators. In view of the significant contribution identified, the paper also attempts a review of the extent to which the “Resource Curse” phenomenon has characterised the re-emergence of the importance of Ghana's mining sector. The country is, however, not as dependent on its mining sector as some mineral-rich economies, since the contribution of other commodities to national export earnings and GDP is also considerable. The paper concludes that Ghana's mining sector could be sustainable if the policy initiatives, including diversification of the sector, strengthening of linkages other than fiscal, curbing the dependence on imports, curbing public expenditure, and improving productivity through training and appropriate technology transfer, which the government is now focusing on, were implemented.","Volume 27, Issue 2",June 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/2,62
"In recent decades, the rate of economic growth in the developing countries has been inversely related to the share of rents in GDP. The resource-poor countries out-performed the resource-abundant ones and among the latter the small mineral economies performed least well and the oil-exporters worst of all. This outcome is counter-intuitive because mineral rents can boost investment while mineral exports can expand import capacity. One explanation is that Dutch Disease effects from mineral booms trigger trade policy closure that distorts the economy. But most high-rent capital-surplus oil economies like Saudi Arabia eschewed trade policy closure and still experienced a growth collapse. A second explanation lies in the political economy: resource-rich countries have been less likely than resource-poor countries to spawn developmental political states. The latter have two key features: first, sufficient autonomy to pursue a coherent economic policy; and second, the aim of raising social welfare. This paper compares Botswana, a rare case of a resource-rich country with a developmental political state, with Saudi Arabia, which had less autonomy in policy formulation due to its role as swing producer in OPEC and cultural pressures for a paternalistic deployment of the oil rents. It argues that although Botswana experienced more success than Saudi Arabia in deploying its mineral rents, this may owe much to its more stable rent stream rather than to its political state alone. Moreover, it is still premature to judge Botswana wholly successful.","Volume 27, Issue 2",June 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/2,62
"The share of electric arc furnace steel-making technology in world crude steel production has risen from 15% in 1970 to 34% in 1997. This trend has permanently altered the composition of metallics feed into the steel-making process since the electric arc furnace primarily uses scrap steel as feed, unlike the more traditional basic oxygen method, which uses iron ore and coking coal as feed. Continuation of this trend will have significant implications for iron ore and coking coal demand in the longer term.This paper uses the diffusion curve approach to technology adoption to model and forecast growth in the EAF share of crude steel production in Japan and the United States. The inclusion of a dynamic adoption ceiling within the diffusion model framework is a major advantage over previous work in this area. These models are applied to two of the world's largest steel producers, Japan and the United States. In Japan, the EAF share of steel production is forecast to rise from 32.8% in 1997 to 36.5% in 2010, and from 43.8% to 50.1% in the United States over the same period.","Volume 27, Issue 2",June 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/2,62
"Over the past two decades, the copper industry has enjoyed dramatic increases in labor productivity in both Chile and the United States. Recent research attributes most of the increase in the United States to innovation and technological change, rather than the exploitation of higher quality copper deposits due to the development of new mines and a shift in output from low to high productivity mines.This article assesses the sources of productivity growth in Chile, where well over half of the copper now produced comes from new mines. While better copper deposits are more important in Chile than the United States, innovation and technological change have contributed substantially to the growth in labor productivity in Chile as well. These findings are important for companies and countries striving to maintain a comparative advantage in mining.","Volume 27, Issue 2",June 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/2,62
"The ability of a mine to survive cyclical downturns depends, according to economic theory, largely on its variable production costs. Since labor accounts for a sizeable share of the variable costs of mining, a mine that enters a recession with relatively high labor productivity and that manages during the recession to raise its labor productivity should be more likely than other mines to avoid cutbacks and closure.The US copper industry over the 1975–90 period provides empirical support for this expectation. But surprisingly, it also suggests that mine survival depends (a) more on labor productivity than variable costs, and (b) more on the ability of a mine to increase its labor productivity once in a recession than on a high level of labor productivity at the start of a recession. An important factor affecting the extent to which mines increase labor productivity once in a recession is the life expectancy of their reserves.","Volume 27, Issue 2",June 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/2,62
"The main objective of this paper is to measure the impact of the mining sector on the Chilean II region and evaluate the conditions that affect the magnitude of this impact. Using an Input Output matrix for the II region, we calculate the impact on output, income and employment. Later, we compare the impact on the labor market between private and state owned firms, showing that there is a significant difference in the management system of each firm that results in different costs and benefits for regional development. There also are important differences in impacts associated with fly-in fly-out workers from other regions that are partially measured by the multipliers.The analysis shows that the mining sector is not important in terms of the backward and forward linkages within the region, but is very important in terms of its volume of production. The main linkages of the mining sector are with the three sectors with the highest backward and forward linkages; when these linkages are considered along with mining's level of production, mining is by far the most important sector of the Chilean II region. Finally, we survey other impacts on the quality of life of the regional population, describing the actions that have been taken by private and state owned firms, as well as the role of the government in promoting development in the II region.","Volume 27, Issue 2",June 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/2,62
"Recent decades have witnessed accelerated growth in the demand for construction aggregates in Taiwan. The ecological pressures caused by riverbed mining of aggregates have resulted in shortages in domestic supply. Simultaneously, Taiwan must contend with the accumulated generation of construction wastes. Industrial ecology offers solutions that recover resources from construction wastes. For example, in areas of high-density urban construction, the use of crushed concrete can be economically attractive. To investigate environmentally sound and economically feasible solutions for satisfying future demand, researchers at National Taiwan University and Columbia University propose a study of the long-range consequences of utilizing domestic supply sources including construction waste.","Volume 27, Issue 2",June 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/2,62
"Adopting the values of sustainable development implies an increase in the mining industry's environmental and social costs. For an industry already offering poor returns on capital this is potentially a problem. An examination of the historical record, however, reveals that past increases in environmental and social costs have been more than offset by developments in industry productivity. The emergence of information and communication technologies seems likely to extend this trend into the future. The particular challenges being faced by mining in the US appear to be less to do with rising environmental costs than with competition from countries which have recently opened up to foreign mining investment and to a strong dollar. It seems likely that industry's adoption of more sustainable practices will require, and could even promote, improved returns to capital in mining.","Volume 27, Issue 1",March 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/1,63
"Upon the arrival of Portuguese settlers to Brazil in 1500, there was an obsession to find precious metals and gems. However, it took almost two centuries to find economic and abundant gold deposits in Minas Gerais. Gold and diamonds generated fabulous wealth to the Portuguese crown during the 18th century and part of the next. As the alluvial deposits were depleted, better techniques had to be employed to assure profitability, but a number of failures apparently eroded the motivation of Brazilian entrepreneurs to invest in mining during the Empire. As the population grew and the country started its industrialization process in the 20th century, the mining industry diversified intensely and became one of the six largest mineral producers in the world. Notwithstanding these achievements, it is likely that the best is yet to come, regarding gold, diamonds and other valuable minerals.","Volume 27, Issue 1",March 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/1,63
"In the absence of a developmental political state, natural resource abundance may impede the economic transition by diminishing the urgency of reform and by distorting the economy (through Dutch disease effects and also rent-seeking behavior and corruption). These problems tend to be especially acute in mineral-rich economies because the socio-economic linkages from mining concentrate revenues on the government and increase the risk of policy failure. This paper tests these hypotheses through a comparison of mineral-rich and resource-poor countries in transition in the Caspian region, all of which failed to evolve developmental political states. It shows that the mineral-rich countries are slower reformers, despite the fact in three of the four resource-poor countries the reforms were adversely impacted by civil strife. Mineral-rich countries also experience a stronger rebound of the real exchange rate and greater shrinkage of employment in the tradeable sector. These differences are reflected in a reverse J-shape post-transition development trajectory for the mineral-rich countries compared to the V-shaped trajectory of the resource-poor countries. However, rent-seeking and corruption do not appear to vary with the natural resource endowment.","Volume 27, Issue 1",March 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/1,63
"After keeping roughly in pace with the world share index for a decade, the index of non-ferrous mining companies' shares fell relatively in 1997–1998, and has never regained its lost ground. The collapse partly reflects the changed priorities of global investors, but also mirrors the mining industry's poor profits record. Data are sparse, but all the evidence, as presented in the main section of the paper, shows that the mining industry's profitability has been poor for most of the past two decades. That has been mainly because of weak prices, resulting not from sluggish demand, as from the industry's ingrained tendency towards excess capacity. That flows from the actions and policies of the industry's management. Possible ways of remedying the weaknesses are discussed, with bleak conclusions.","Volume 27, Issue 1",March 2001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/27/issue/1,63

"It is becoming a standard practice for governments to require mining operations to post reclamation bonds. Yet, there have been few theoretical treatments examining the rationale for bonding mechanisms, and even fewer empirical treatments of the effectiveness of bonding. This paper addresses some of these holes in the literature. It begins by examining the rationale underlying reclamation bonds, and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of bonding as a tool for enforcing reclamation requirements. The role of bonding mechanisms is to help enforce standards, not necessarily yield efficient outcomes, and these mechanisms are best viewed as a complement to — not a substitute for — liability rules. The paper also examines the effectiveness of bonding by drawing on evidence from hardrock mining on public lands in the western United States.","Volume 26, Issue 4",December 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/4,64
"Overseas mineral exploration and mining investment by Australian companies increased dramatically from the early 1990s until 1997. In the wake of the Asian economic crisis and lower commodity prices it declined somewhat in 1998 and 1999. Reflecting their international competitiveness, Australian resource companies were actively involved in projects in about eighty nations in 1999. This study assesses the extent of growth in exploration and mining operations, the distribution between large and small companies and the changing regional focus which has been occurring. It also reflects on some of the key influences on this development. These include a strong domestic finance sector, supporting mining services provision, technological competitiveness, a growing attractiveness of offshore locations and increasing structural impediments at home.","Volume 26, Issue 4",December 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/4,64
"This research studies the relationship between the capital structure of a firm and its asset utilization rate in resource intensive industries. We study this issue from both private and public policy perspectives. From a private perspective, it's conceivable that a positive relationship may exist because a company is trying to increase its use of debt to effect a more efficient utilization of its assets. However, from a public policy perspective, finding a positive relationship between asset utilization and debt levels in natural resource sensitive industries may signal a sub-optimal exploitation of natural resources when debt levels rise. This research examines measures of leverage and asset utilization in firms from the mining, oil, and timber industries to determine whether the behavior alleged in the PALCO/MAXXAM case (an increased cutting rate to pay off junk bond financing) has been observed more systematically. We observe a positive relationship between leverage and asset utilization in all three industries when leverage is calculated using book value measures. When market value measures are used, this positive relationship no longer holds in the mining industry. Possible explanations for these results are offered.","Volume 26, Issue 4",December 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/4,64
"This paper contributes to our understanding of the perceived benefits for society of risk-sharing resource taxation. In the particular context of log-normally distributed prices a model is developed which enables comparison of risk-sharing resource taxation with an alternative in determining the overall return to society from auctioning an extraction lease. The main finding of the paper is a potential exception to the general preference for risk-sharing resource taxation if the bidding firms are effectively risk neutral. This exception is illustrated numerically in the context of the impact of increased price uncertainty, but it is shown not to be robust with respect to divergences from risk neutrality in the risk attitudes of firms. Consequently, it is concluded that the choice of risk-sharing resource taxation is likely to be in society's best interests, regardless of the probability distribution of prices.","Volume 26, Issue 4",December 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/4,64
"This paper examines sustainable development in the corporate mining context, and provides some guidelines for mining companies seeking to operate more sustainably. There is now a burgeoning literature that examines sustainable development in the context of minerals and mining, most of which is concerned with sustainability at global and national scales. What is often challenging to ascertain, however, from these numerous perspectives on sustainable mineral extraction, minerals and metals recycling, environmental management, and social performance, is how sustainable development applies to mining companies themselves, and what steps a mine must take in order to improve the sustainability of operations. Since mining processes have the potential to impact a diverse group of environmental entities, and are of interest to a wide range of stakeholder groups, there is ample opportunity for the industry to operate more sustainably. Specifically, with improved planning, implementation of sound environmental management tools and cleaner technologies, extended social responsibility to stakeholder groups, the formation of sustainability partnerships, and improved training, a mine can improve performance in both the environmental and socioeconomic arenas, and thus contribute enormously to sustainable development at the mine level.","Volume 26, Issue 4",December 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/4,64
"Community relations have in recent years become an increasingly important component of mining companies' strategic thinking. This is partly because a failure to respond to growing community activism can impose substantial costs on mining companies. It is also because the competitive environment — in relation to customers, resources and the labour market — is changing in ways that favour those companies which take their community relationships seriously. At the same time that community issues are having an increasing influence on mining business behaviour, so business principles are helping to shape mining companies' approach to managing their community affairs, by emphasising rigour, reciprocity and sustainability.","Volume 26, Issue 3",September 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/3,65
"Progress in the modelling of exploration activities and extraction activities have been moving in parallel over the years. Many large corporations in the oil and gas sector take decisions pertaining to exploration and extraction activities jointly. These organizations are expanding their activities with vertical integration upstream and/or downstream to improve profitability. In this paper, first, an extensive survey of literature is made, both in the areas of exploration and extraction, highlighting the need to bridge the gap between the two. Second, with an aim to unify the two streams in an integrated framework, an integrated dynamic optimization model with non-linear constraints has been conceptualized. This model combines a practical methodology to determine the optimal rate of extraction of oil and gas with a hybrid approach to estimate the discovery rate of petroleum resources in future, additionally incorporating a stochastic specification in order to capture the uncertainty associated with discovery. Further, an illustrative case study is done by applying the modelling framework to the upstream petroleum sector in India.","Volume 26, Issue 3",September 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/3,65
"This paper analyzes the role of fuel flexibility in the West European power generation sector. Fuel flexibility is recognized to have two important features. It improves the power sector's ability to respond to fuel supply interruptions, and it permits short-run price-induced interfuel competition. The security of supply issue is examined by assessing the ability of the West European power sector to respond to an interruption in gas imports. This ability is found to be high. Especially the use of oil in dual- and multi-fired plants provides a significant buffer against a potential gas supply cut. In an attempt to measure the degree of price-induced interfuel substitution in West European power generation two flexible cost functions are employed; the Translog and the Generalized Leontief. The cross-price elasticities of fossil fuel demand generated by these indicate notable short-run interfuel substitution in Western Europe, in particular between oil and gas. Since emerging competitive electricity and gas markets normally induce utilities to reduce fuel costs through improved fuel contracting, short-run interfuel substitution is likely to remain significant also in the future. This has important implications for European energy markets and policies.","Volume 26, Issue 3",September 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/3,65

It is found that major institutional changes have taken place in the Chinese steel industry. These changes have important implications for steel production, consumption and trade in China. According to this study, China's steel production will continue to expand in the coming decade though there are potential uncertainties. Demand, the driving forces behind China's steel expansion, is predicted to grow too. In particular, demand for steel will be boosted significantly if several frontier areas are tapped into. China will be the largest steel consumer in the world. As a result, China will play an increasingly more important role in international steel trade.

However, the activities of the minerals industry are concentrated in particular regions of WA. The key purpose of this paper is to quantify the extent to which the indirect employment effects from the minerals industry are more widely dispersed regionally than are the direct effects. Using a CGE model and a tops-down approach, we find that the flow-on effects from minerals are considerably more widely dispersed than the direct effects. However, it must be noted that the extent of this dispersion may be exaggerated by the tops-down methodology.","Volume 26, Issue 2",June 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/2,66
"A growing literature is developing parallel to increasing “voice of society” concerns about corporate social and environmental responsibility. Emerging research suggests that, while public policy might provide the framework for the internalisation of previous external environmental damage costs, it is corporate strategy that can make the difference between environmental disaster and pollution prevention, and responsible business practice is defined by its anticipative and pro-active approach to ensuring that pollution is prevented and mine closure is accompanied by clean-up and reclamation. The Summitville gold mine, an abandoned open pit and underground operation in Colorado is often described as an “environmental disaster” and one of the most notorious example of inadequate design, poor operation and failed environmental management at a mining operation in the US, past or present. Now a Superfund site, and the subject of numerous legal suits and counter-suits, its unplanned and sudden closure and abandonment in December 1992 has had profound implications for environmental protection, the costs and benefits of remedial treatment, technology issues and the regulatory process in both the USA and globally.Of great import are the factors that influenced the development of events at Summitville, and these are discussed in two broad areas: corporate strategy during the development and operation of the site; and, the regulatory framework within which the mine was permitted, operated and abandoned. Finally, the implications of the abandonment of Summitville mine for the wider mining industry, regulatory authorities and the policy literature in this field, are discussed.","Volume 26, Issue 2",June 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/2,66
"This paper uses an intensity of use model to forecast crude steel consumption in Japan over the period 1997–2005. Six steel consuming industries are identified; machinery, electrical machinery and equipment, transport equipment, other manufacturing, construction, and fabricated metal products. The model decomposes changes in steel consumption for each industry into three components: (i) changes in the steel intensity of production in each steel consuming industry, (ii) changes in the size of these industries relative to aggregate domestic production and (iii) the rate of growth in GDP. Forecasts of these separate components for the six steel consuming industries are then used to forecast aggregate steel consumption. The results suggest that crude steel consumption in Japan will fall from 82.1 million tonnes in 1997 to around 73.1 million tonnes in 2005. The cause of this reduction in consumption is cyclically low GDP growth and further permanent reductions in the steel intensity of Japanese production over the forecast period. An interesting finding of this paper is that cyclical increases in investment expenditure in Japan appear to lead to significant rises in the steel intensity of domestic production, and hence steel consumption.","Volume 26, Issue 2",June 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/2,66
"Indigenous landowners often have a unique attachment to the land. In Fiji indigenous landowners believe that they own everything below and above the land including minerals. Often friction between landowners, on the one hand, and explorers and developers, on the other, has arisen due to the former feeling that fair compensation has not been paid. In Fiji at present no comprehensive system of compensation exists. Additional problems arise as customary and statutory laws with respect to distribution of benefits are inconsistent. This paper discusses the issues in Fiji relevant to compensation for damages caused by mineral exploration and mining activities and the proposed Compensation Policy for Fiji's Minerals Sector. It also highlights the application of the theory of evaluating compensable damages in the said Policy document.","Volume 26, Issue 2",June 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/2,66
"Offshore oil leases may be awarded by an auction system or through an administrative system based on an evaluation of the applicant's financial and technological capability. It is well known that allocating leases by administrative decision is economically inefficient and therefore dissipates potential resource rent. In most cases, severe restrictions are also put on the possibilities to trade leases in secondary markets. It is therefore unlikely that trade in secondary markets can provide a complete solution to correcting inefficiencies in the initial lease allocation system.It is essential to choose a primary lease allocation system that directly addresses the public policy and economic objectives of the petroleum activities. In several industries such as telecommunications (the electromagnetic spectrum) and the aviation industry (airport slots), where the problem of allocating scarce public resources has been addressed for some time, we have seen a trend towards allocation of exclusive rights by administrative decision being replaced by allocation by auction. In this paper, the design of auctions for allocation of petroleum leases is discussed. In addition other issues are considered, i.e. how public policy objectives can be addressed through the design of the auction and to what extent the authorities should rely on auctions as the sole instrument to capture resource rent.","Volume 26, Issue 1",March 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/1,67
"We use input–output techniques to analyse the impacts of gold, coal, and other mining activities upon the South African economy between 1971 and 1993. Our results suggest that the premise upon which the South African government's proposed minerals policy is based, i.e. that “the mining industries have the capacity to generate wealth and employment on a large scale” (Republic of South Africa, Department of Minerals and Energy, 1998. A minerals and mining policy. White Paper, Department of Minerals and Energy, Republic of South Africa), may require further thought. Our estimated production and employment multipliers indicate that the impacts of marginal changes in mining production and employment were not significantly different from production and employment impacts of most other South African economic activities and that there were few linkages between mining and the rest of the economy. These results suggest that South African mining activities will increase income and employment only if exports increase or if policies are established to increase linkages between mining and the rest of the South African economy.","Volume 26, Issue 1",March 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/1,67
"There exists a rule of thumb of mines, which requires that the cut-off grade, that is the lowest grade of extracted ore, should decrease (increase) when the present value price of metal increases (decreases). Theoretically, it was shown that the mining rule is optimal, if the deposit has a disorderly ore quality distribution. Conversely, if the deposit has an orderly ore quality distribution, the reverse rule is optimal, where the reverse rule requires that the cut-off grade should increase (decrease) when the present value price of metal increases (decreases). In this paper, the theoretical results are tested empirically from the data of 51 copper mines during 1970–1992. It is found that they are supported by the data.","Volume 26, Issue 1",March 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/1,67
"As the principal user of old scrap, secondary aluminium smelters and refiners have traditionally played a key role in the recycling of aluminium, producing primarily cast material demanded primarily by the automobile industry. The purpose of this paper is to explore the supply–demand relationships in the market for secondary aluminium alloys. Based on a standard microeconomic model, where the determinants of supply and demand are identified, an econometric model, using data from Germany, France, Italy and the UK for the time period 1983–97, is estimated. The model is used to assess the relative importance of the factors determining the supply and demand of the European secondary aluminium industry. The results show that both the supply and the derived demand for secondary aluminium is own-price inelastic, which is reasonable given the short-run framework. On the demand side, the level of auto production is found to have a substantial impact on the level of secondary aluminium alloy demand. We conclude that the model describes the market reasonably well. The inelastic supply in combination with the sensitivity to changes in the level of auto production provides a tentative explanation of the observed volatility in secondary aluminium prices. Furthermore, the inelastic supply responses indicate that policies aimed at increasing recycling using price-based incentives will be inefficient.","Volume 26, Issue 1",March 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/1,67
"Mining companies can have differing reactions to the imposition of environmental approvals regulation. Reactions range on a continuum from “inactive”, through to “interactive”. This article reports on a survey of senior environment managers in Toronto-based mining companies, making up 80% of mining sector market capitalization on the Toronto Stock Exchange.This exploratory research indicates that 70% of interviewed executives perceive their companies to have either a proactive or an interactive approach to environmental approvals regulation. There appear to be five possible determinants of these reactions: organizational learning; types of regulation; influence of stakeholders; jurisdictional culture; and corporate culture.","Volume 26, Issue 1",March 2000,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/26/issue/1,67
Almost all the issues of sustainable development in China relate to natural resources. Sustainable development as one of the most important strategies has been incorporated into all the actions related to the planning and management of natural resources in China. This paper gives an overview of the contributions of natural resources and the challenges facing the natural resource sectors. It contributes a series of proposals on the planning and management of natural resources. It also outlines the general framework of the planning system for natural resources and summarizes the Great Survey of Natural Resources Program that the Ministry of Land and Resources is implementing.,"Volume 25, Issue 4",December 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/4,68
"During the 1970s and 1980s the main concern of mining policies was to attract investment whilst at the same time balancing the interests of governments and companies. By the turn of the century a new spectrum of challenges faces governments and companies in the mining sector. The need for fiscal regimes to adapt to price cyclicity is to some extent superseded by the requirement that they adapt to a long-term decline of metal prices. The growing importance of environmental and community affairs in the mining sector will force governments to design coherent and comprehensive tax regulations to complement the wide range of initiatives being taken in these fields. Finally, the age-old problem of tax collection continues to raise its head in transition and developing economies.","Volume 25, Issue 4",December 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/4,68
"Metal price fluctuations have recently been of interest not only because of their cyclical volatility but also of their interaction with business cycles. A related issue is whether metal prices move together sufficiently to collectively reflect macroeconomic influences. Correlation or the tendency for prices to move together has been termed “comovement”, where the commonality in prices reflects the tendency of commodity markets to respond to common business cycle and trend factors. Metal prices are known to respond to macroeconomic influences and the latter might well explain the common factor which causes them to move together. Our goal is to provide an estimate of the common factor in metal prices and to relate this factor to important macroeconomic influences. The prices we study are for aluminum, copper, tin, lead and zinc; the macroeconomic variables include industrial production, consumer prices, interest rates, stock prices, and exchange rates. Our results confirm that the common factor in metal prices can be related to such macroeconomic influences.","Volume 25, Issue 4",December 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/4,68
"In this paper, a system dynamics model is described, which simulates long-term trends in the production and consumption of metals (i.e. iron/steel and an aggregate of metals of medium abundance) in relation to impacts such as ore-grade decline, capital and energy requirements and waste flows. This metal model can be of assistance in exploring the issue of sustainability of metal resource use. Application of the model to historical trends shows it to be fairly capable of reproducing the long-term trends in the 1900–1990 period, among others on the basis of two intensity of use curves applied to 13 world regions. For future trends, a set of perspective-based long-term scenarios has been constructed that represent the major paradigms in resource use. These scenarios highlight some of the uncertain factors in the relation between economic growth, metal resource exploitation and use, and energy and environmental consequences. They also indicate that apparently similar metal flows in society may be the result of quite different and sometimes contrary assumptions on metal demand, production patterns and resource base characteristics. Such analyses contribute to a more open and transparent discussion on the issue at hand by adding quantitative explications to qualitative views.","Volume 25, Issue 4",December 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/4,68
"In this study, an option pricing model and a dynamic programming model are developed. These models contribute to the improvement of the decision making process in two respects. First, these models allow for the own growth rate of mining costs to be incorporated into the analysis. Second, these models are developed to estimate the satisfactory gross revenue for investing, so that these models are helpful in analyzing multi-metal mines.The two models are applied to estimate the satisfactory revenue for investing in the Carlin east gold mine, Nevada, USA. The satisfactory revenue estimated by the option pricing model is found to be $42.2M, while that estimated by the dynamic programming model is found to be $44.4M. Since the revenue calculated on the basis of the current conditions is $36M, then the decision by option pricing and dynamic programming is to wait and not to invest now. Despite the difference between the two models in estimating and applying the discount rate, the two models generate the same decision.","Volume 25, Issue 4",December 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/4,68
"Production of gold in Australia has grown strongly in recent years. Australia is ranked the world's third largest gold producer, only South Africa and the US produce more than Australia. Most of the Australian gold production comes from one of its states, Western Australia. In this paper, we use recent developments in econometric time series analysis to present an analysis of gold production and prices during the period 1948–1994. The results show that if the price of gold (relative to costs) increases by 10% and the price (in levels) remain the same for the next 5 years, then in the first year gold production will rise by 0.3%; in the second year by 2.2%; in the third year by 7.4%; in the fourth year by 8.9% and in the fifth year by 10.7%.","Volume 25, Issue 4",December 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/4,68
"This paper reflects on how sustainability is being interpreted both theoretically and in practice for the primary extraction industries. Two contrasting perspectives can be adopted: one states that continued extraction of non-renewable resources is a necessary part of sustainable development, whilst the other states that extraction of these resources must be greatly reduced or even eliminated. It is shown that these different approaches can be traced back to underlying, often unarticulated, assumptions about the acceptability of trade-offs between different societal goals; attitudes towards uncertainties in scientific analysis and the reliability of management systems; and the perceived appropriateness of system boundaries at different conceptual scales. These assumptions are founded in the self-perception of organisations and individuals about their roles in society, and the cultural context within which these organisations and individuals define their raison d'être.","Volume 25, Issue 4",December 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/4,68
"This paper analyzes China's imports of iron ore from Australia, using annual time series data for the period 1973–1996. Considerations include variables affecting iron ore trade between the two countries, such as the previous trade volume, GDP growth rate and steel production in China, labor disputes in Australia, the relative price of Australia's iron ore to the world average, and Chinese government policies. Results indicate that China's import of Australia's iron ore is positively affected by the volume of steel production in China and Chinese government's policy following the cultural revolution era. Increases in the relative price of Australia's iron ore and labor disputes measured by the working days lost in Australia appear to reduce China's import demand.","Volume 25, Issue 3",September 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/3,69
"Titanium metal is still considered an almost “precious” material, a niche market to be used solely for very specific jobs, instead it could be placed, with regards to production, consumption and application, among the stainless steels and Aluminium alloys. The aim of this work is to try to analyse the reasons why there is still a considerable resistance hindering a complete dimensional development of this sector, despite a great world abundance and large geographical distribution of titanium supplies as well as the excellent performance of the material itself: production restriction and a curb on development seen as endogenous variables seem to be a typical consequence of a basically oligopolistic market with technological constraints.","Volume 25, Issue 3",September 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/3,69

"The Arrow–Fisher–Henry (AFH) analysis of land development under uncertainty has been conducted in a two period model in which the decision to develop is indivisible. Recently, this analysis has been extended to study the development problem in a multi-period framework. However, very little is known about the nature of the development decision when this decision is divisible. Consequently, this paper has two objectives.

Next, we formally analyze the impact of divisibility on the land development decision over time and under uncertainty.","Volume 25, Issue 3",September 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/3,69
"Including car, truck, bus, and airplane tires, 266 million tires were scrapped in the US in 1996 (Scrap Tire Management Council (STMC), 1997.). More than three-quarters of these tires were used as fuel, recycled for material applications, or exported. The remainder accumulates in junkyards or landfills where they pose a fire hazard and provide a breeding ground for disease carrying rodents and insects. Using information on scrap tire composition and the current markets using them, we examine the technologies used to recover their value either for energy or as rubber. As the majority of scrap tires are used as fuel, we calculate their life cycle energy budget considering both the energy consumed for tire production and the energy recovered from their use as fuel. Based on our findings, we draw some preliminary conclusions on how to maximize value recovery from this ubiquitous artifact of industrial societies.","Volume 25, Issue 3",September 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/3,69
"The issues surrounding mineral development have changed dramatically within the last decade and the changes associated with dealing with the social and cultural issues surrounding mineral development have seen the greatest change. The result of all of these changes is a “New Reality of Mineral Development” which requires that mineral development be a partnership alliance of industry, government (national and local), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs; national and international) and indigenous peoples, working within the broader context of international treaties and norms, to insure that the exploitation of a nation's resources contributes to sustainable development. Central to achieving the partnership alliance and sustainable development is the requirement that the traditional government–industry alliance of the past becomes an equal partner government–industry–indigenous people–NGO alliance for the future: which requires major changes in the philosophy and actions of all participants.","Volume 25, Issue 3",September 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/3,69
"Recycling in general and metal recycling in particular, many believe, enjoy a very bright future. As resource depletion, environmental concerns, and other factors drive primary production costs up, the relative importance of recycling in supplying the material needs of society will grow. This optimistic view, however, may paint an overly rosy and misleading picture.A large portion of secondary metal production is based on the recycling of new scrap, which is constrained far more by the available supply of new scrap than by metal prices or recycling costs. Secondary production from old scrap is more sensitive to costs and prices, and so would benefit from a rise in metal prices. History, however, indicates that the cost-reducing effects of new technology have over the past century more than offset the cost-increasing effects of depletion, causing real metal prices to fall. In recent decades, this decline in prices has continued despite government policies that are increasingly forcing firms to cover their environmental costs.While this favorable trend may not continue forever, it does suggest that secondary producers will have to pursue aggressively new technologies and other innovations that reduce their costs as fast or faster than primary producers if they hope to expand their future share of total metal production.","Volume 25, Issue 3",September 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/3,69
"This paper develops a model of gold production which makes use of the relationship between the price of gold and the average mill pay limit, which allows for the possibility of an inverse gold supply curve. Increases in the price of gold, with constant production costs, reduce the average mill pay limit which gives an incentive for producers to step up production and move into deeper shafts of lower quality ore. If the decrease in the average grade of ore outweighs the increase in the quantity of ore milled, the actual amount of gold produced will fall. An econometric specification of the model using South African production data suggests that the necessary conditions for a perversely downward sloping supply curve of gold are unlikely to exist.","Volume 25, Issue 2",June 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/2,70
"Quarries create externalities such as noise, dust, and visual disamenity in the production of minerals. Externalities can be regulated by taxes, or land-use controls specifying externality levels not to be exceeded. This article shows how stated preference methods can be used to estimate the value to local residents of avoiding different externality levels from a quarry. From this a tax value per tonne is derived, and this tax level compared to that proposed by the UK Government. The efficacy of land-use controls is investigated, and compared in efficiency and equity terms with tax based regulation.","Volume 25, Issue 2",June 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/2,70
"Metal demand over the short run is widely thought to be elastic with respect to income (GDP), since metals are largely consumed in construction and other economic sectors whose output fluctuates greatly over the business cycle. Yet efforts to estimate metal demand functions typically find that the short-run income elasticity of metal demand is less than one. This article examines a possible explanation for this inconsistency. In particular, it suggests the empirical analyses are deficient in that they fail to take account of changing technology and consumer preferences. This omission, it argues, causes the estimates for the income elasticity of metal demand for the developed countries, which account for most of the world's metal consumption, to be severely underestimated. For the developing countries, the resulting omitted variable bias, if negative, is expected to be less severe, and may even be positive. When time is used in a partial adjustment model as a proxy for changes in consumer preferences and in technology, the findings for six metals over the 1963–92 period are consistent with these expectations.","Volume 25, Issue 2",June 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/2,70
"This paper uses Bayesian vector autoregression models to forecast steel consumption in South–East Asia to 2005. This technique uses both historical correlations among the variables in the system and Bayesian priors on the parameters to introduce more flexibility into the forecasting process and align the models closer in nature to more traditional structural commodity market models.The forecasts suggest that steel consumption in South–East Asia will rise from 35 million tonnes in 1997 to between 48 and 57 million tonnes in 2005 under the low and high growth scenarios used in this paper. The difference between these forecasts highlights the sensitivity of steel consumption to GDP growth, particularly in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. Thailand is expected to remain the largest steel consumer in the region, while Malaysia is forecast to experience the most rapid growth in consumption.","Volume 25, Issue 2",June 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/2,70
"The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) of 1977 established a regulatory framework to internalize environmental costs from coal mining, directed mainly at surface mining impacts. However, some sections of SMCRA also address environmental effects from underground mining. A particularly contentious issue has been whether subsidence or ground slumping caused by underground coal mining is prohibited in extensive areas protected by section 522(e) of SMCRA. This issue has never been settled at the Federal level due to successful legal challenges. In 1997, the US Department of the Interior reissued new draft rules. Important implications for impact, underlying economics, and policy choices stem from the fact that section 522(e) deals with protection both of public lands and private lands over underground coal. Policy instruments for efficient protection are quite different between the public and private lands. The proposed rules, analyzed herein, are only partly successful in implementing policies that address both public and private protections.","Volume 25, Issue 2",June 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/2,70

In particular, we analyse what the WA economy would look like had the growth in minerals not taken place. We develop methods to decompose the observed growth in the economy into minerals and non-mineral components. It is estimated that once the direct and indirect effects are properly accounted for, the minerals sector is responsible for about 40% of the growth in the WA economy over the 1990s—about twice its average share in gross state product. Interestingly, we find that service sectors, such as Transport, Wholesale and Retail trade and entertainment, and Education, health and welfare, would be substantially smaller had the minerals sector stagnated.","Volume 25, Issue 1",March 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/1,71
"Given Japan's dominant position in the Asia–Pacific regional coal market and the continuing relatively low profitability of Australia's coal industry, the influence of the Japanese steel mills on coal pricing arrangements between Australia and Japan remains an issue in Australia. In Japanese fiscal year (JFY) 1996, the Japanese steel mills replaced benchmark pricing with the “fair treatment” pricing system whereby coal contract information is kept confidential. In this paper, Quandt's switching regime model is used to test for structural change in hedonic pricing relationships in the important Australia–Japan coking coal trade between JFY 1992 and 1997. There is statistical evidence of significant structural change in JFY 1996 for hard coking coal and in JFY 1995 for semisoft coking coal (when soft coking coal was merged with the semisoft category). The goodness of fit of the regressions is lower in each recent period. It is concluded that price discovery in the annual coal negotiations, particularly for hard coking coal, is relatively more difficult under fair treatment pricing.","Volume 25, Issue 1",March 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/1,71

As a consequence, a key policy issue in Australia has been the extent to which Japan's coal pricing and investment policies have influenced coal market outcomes. In this paper, a regional hedonic pricing model of Australia's coking coal exports is estimated for the period JFY1989 to 1996. Non-Japan regional intercept dummy variables were found to be significantly different from zero, although these varied across coal categories and years. However, the empirical evidence indicates that Japan does not pay significantly lower prices relative to other major export markets for coking coal of a given quality.","Volume 25, Issue 1",March 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/1,71

"Six of the Arabian Gulf countries are founding members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (G.C.C.) and are known as G.C.C. member States. Jointly, in 1997, they held close to 46 per cent of the world crude oil reserves and derived a major part of their national income from oil revenues. The study analyzes the response of these States to the changes in world oil prices over two major time periods: a 1972–1980 period (Phase I) of steadily increasing prices and a 1981–1996 period (Phase II) of steadily declining and then weakly recovering prices. Phase I is characterized in the member States by an unprecedented economic boom and Phase II by an adjustment to strong recessionary pressures. The study assesses the impact on the sectoral outputs of these pressures and of the offsetting government budget deficits. The findings indicate that, in the resulting equilibrium, sectoral output growth was maintained but at a considerably lower rate. Other findings relate to the sectoral re-allocations of national output and to major differences among the member States in the sectoral allocations of their national outputs.","Volume 25, Issue 1",March 1999,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/25/issue/1,71
"Indigenous people in a number of major mineral-producing countries have established a substantial and growing capacity to tax mineral resources extracted from their traditional lands. However, almost no analysis has been conducted regarding the conceptual and practical issues involved in designing mineral taxation regimes for use by indigenous people. The general literature on mineral taxation is of limited relevance because basic assumptions it makes regarding the nature of the taxing authority (national or state governments) do not apply to indigenous peoples. This article discusses some key characteristics of indigenous communities as they relate to taxation of mineral resources. Against this background, it identifies a number of approaches to mineral taxation which might be utilized by indigenous groups and which acknowledge the specific constraints and circumstances they face while at the same time recognizing their need to attract and maintain investment on their traditional lands.

Such exploration is of benefit, even to a risk-neutral company, because it enables a better decision to be made regarding extraction investment (Kretzer, 1994). This paper extends previous contributions to the economics of exploration in several areas which are of practical significance. First, exploration is analysed both in the context of a log-normally distributed resource deposit and of an ad valorem royalty. Second, the role of exploration in an ad valorem royalty regime is contrasted with that of a Resource Rent Tax.

"An intent of the U.S. Federal Regulatory Commission's Order 636, promulgated in April 1992, was to promote competition and efficiency in the transportation sector of the natural gas industry. Additionally, the Order altered the roles of the traditional players in the industry by increasing not only their options for purchase and sale of natural gas, but also their risks. Increased options have the potential of increasing competition and efficiency, not only in the transportation sector, but also in the distribution sector. This paper examines impacts of Order 636. Using annual, aggregate, U.S. price data, a Wilcox rank sum test is employed to test for statistically significant differences between the pre- and post-636 eras. Results indicate median revenues attributable to the transportation sector have declined since the implementation of Order 636.1 Although there are naturally a number of factors that may affect transportation revenues, the decline in median price can be attributed, at least in part, to increased competition, increased efficiency, or both. At this level of aggregation the effects can not be segregated. Results also indicate that although decreased costs of transportation have at least partially been passed on to final consumers, local distribution companies have not significantly altered their business practices when dealing with customers.","Volume 24, Issue 4",December 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/4,72
"Sectoral analysis, a new branch of political science, alleges that mineral extraction creates a socio-political climate that promotes inflexible statism, which in turn leads to substandard development performance. The theory, that mineral economies underperform bureaucratically and economically, is said not only to hold in a post-dictive sense for the mature mineral economies, such as Zambia, but also in a predictive sense for the newer mineral economies, such as Ecuador. This essay reviews and assesses this hypothesis in the light of the empirical evidence comparing mineral production, state capacity, and economic performance.

Gold mining is the principal activity within the sector and accounted for 41 percent of total export earnings in 1996. This paper presents an overview of Ghana's mineral industry and covers mineral resources, production and reserves; mining investments; the role of mining in the economy; and the structure of the industry. An overview of the national mineral policy is also presented to depict the current regulatory and fiscal environment in which the industry operates. The spectacular reversal in mineral sector performance can be attributed to the adoption of World Bank recommendations in a new national mineral policy, the 1986 Minerals and Mining Law, aimed at revitalizing the sector.","Volume 24, Issue 4",December 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/4,72
"The exploitation of mineral wealth can amplify the problems of the transition economies in three basic ways. First, the rebound of the real exchange rate that characterises a successful transition may be augmented by the capital inflow required to expand mineral production. This can cause both recession in the short-run and lower growth in the medium-term. Second, when the mineral revenues expand, the Dutch Disease effects may intensify the transition-related shrinkage of the non-mining tradeable sector, thereby retarding economic diversification and rendering the economy vulnerable to external shocks. Third, a mineral boom tends to concentrate revenue on the government, which may use it to postpone difficult decisions on economic reform and/or dissipate the revenue due to weak financial markets and inadequate public accountability. Kazakstan, like oil-rich Azerbaijan, is a late reformer and displays evidence of a faster transition rebound than other less resource-rich countries in the CIS do. However, Kazakstan has two advantages over Azerbaijan. First, Kazakstan has a more diversified mineral endowment with which to counter any trend towards single commodity specialization. Second, Kazakstan is making a later start on oil expansion so that it can learn from the experience of Azerbaijan. Priorities for Kazakstan are the continuation of prudent economic policies, the creation of institutions to enhance the transparency of the revenue flows, and the use of environmental accounting to provide a rationale for the deployment of the oil rents.","Volume 24, Issue 4",December 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/4,72
"This paper applies a property rights framework to federal mineral lands in the western United States from the enactment of the Mining Law in 1872 until the enactment of the Mineral Leasing Act for fossil fuels in 1920. There are two principal findings. First, the Mining Law appears to have been an effective means for assigning rights to mineral stocks on public lands (at least through 1920). This conclusion is supported by evidence from claim disputes in the West. Second, the impetus for the Mineral Leasing Act did not derive from the different physical characteristics of hardrock minerals and petroleum. The relevance of these conclusions to contemporary mineral policy is also discussed.","Volume 24, Issue 4",December 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/4,72
"Minerals development on public lands and the design of regulatory institutions for the formulation of mining policy have been contentious issues in the American west at least since the enactment of the 1872 Mining Law. In this paper, we first review the relevant literature on these two issues. We then propose and describe a research agenda regarding the future study of (i) land use in the context of minerals development, and (ii) the design of institutions for the regulation of mining. With respect to land use, our agenda focuses on two interrelated questions. First, when should an appropriate authority make preserved public land available for mining? Second, on what fraction of all public lands should this authority permit mining operations to take place? As far as the design of regulatory institutions is concerned, our agenda once again addresses two interrelated questions. First, what are the pros and cons of hierarchical and parallel regulatory structures? Second, how should the regulatory function be structured when a regulated party has to interact with multiple regulatory agencies? We believe that the pursuit of this research agenda will yield interesting and useful policy insights into the above described issues.","Volume 24, Issue 3",September 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/3,73
"Fluctuations in metal prices have been of interest not only because of the instability they impose on the metal industries but also because of the extent to which they reflect changes in business cycle activity. Regularities in these fluctuations have often been characterized as cycles, even though any periodicity they might possess is confounded by stochastic shocks. Our purpose is to focus on short-term price movements, so as to obtain greater information concerning the forecasts needed for purchasing, making sales, trading and performing other day-to-day activities in the metals industry. The metals we study include aluminum, copper, gold, lead, nickel, silver, tin, tungsten and zinc. This study begins with standard business cycle identification procedures employed in macroeconomic research. After applying the Weibull test of cyclical duration to the discovered cycles, the structural time series method is employed to confirm further the statistical significance of the cycles, not only over the total period beginning 1960, but also over appropriate sub-periods. Finally, conclusions are drawn regarding the significance of the cyclical findings.","Volume 24, Issue 3",September 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/3,73

"The role of trading companies has been held by many economists to be that of reducing transaction costs between buyer and seller. This article examines the influence that Japanese general trading companies, known in Japan as sogo shosha, have on contract bargaining outcomes between buyers and sellers in the trade between the exporters of Australia, and Japan, the world's largest importer of metallurgical coal. Propositions that sogo shosha companies have played a differential role, influenced by factors peculiar to Japanese business culture, are examined in light of econometric modelling findings suggesting distortions in Pacific metallurgical coal markets. The veracity of the propositions is also explored by a survey of the literature and management opinion amongst coal exporters from Australia and Canada. Implications with respect to foreign ownership policies and countervailing contract bargaining strategies by Australian exporting interests are then explored.","Volume 24, Issue 3",September 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/3,73
"During the 1990s there has been a shift in exploration investment by multinational mining companies into regions that were previously closed or considered too risky. Many nations have introduced changes to their mineral policies, mining laws, and fiscal systems, and the author traces some of the major regulatory trends in developing, developed and transition economies. The author discusses trends in mining laws and provides data on current fiscal systems in 25 tax jurisdictions. The author concludes that the effect of recent changes has been to reduce barriers to entry and lower risk, thus encouraging increased investment in an ever-increasing number of countries.","Volume 24, Issue 2",June 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/2,74

Canada's new minerals and metals policy seeks to promote a prosperous and competitive minerals and metals industry that operates on a sustainable basis. The policy demonstrates how the concept applies to minerals and metals. Until recently, these non-renewable resources have often been overlooked when sustainable development is discussed in the context of natural resources.

"With the dissolution of the former Soviet Union in 1991, the nations of Central Asia gained independence and began the transition to market driven economies. Both the political and economic transformations of the Central Asian Republics (CARs) (Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) have been difficult primarily because of a holdover of various centrally planned `command and control' approaches to national development. The extensive mapping and exploration of the CARs during the Soviet era (approximately 1921–1991) led to the discovery of several hundreds of mineral deposits that were subsequently evaluated, and it is this `pool' of known, but undeveloped, deposits which is of major interest to foreign and domestic companies. However, foreign investment in the mineral sectors of the CARs is at best quite modest and there are very few positive signs that foreign investment will increase dramatically in the near term. The major risks that the mining industry faces as it works in the CARs arise primarily from the fact that the nations are transitional economies which lack both a comprehensive legal framework and experience in dealing with foreign mining corporations and their practices. The major risks are political, economic, financial, infrastructure, contractual, environmental, social and cultural and workforce related. If all individual risk factors are weighted equally, the relative ranking of the countries (from least risk to most risk for mineral development) would be Kyrgyzstan, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan respectively. However, such a classification scheme does not effectively weight the importance of mineral potential. If the risk criteria are weighted with respect to geologic potential, the ranking of the countries would be (from least risk to most risk) Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, respectively.","Volume 24, Issue 2",June 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/2,74
"With the dissolution of the former Soviet Union in 1991, the nations of Central Asia gained independence and began the transition to market driven economies. Within the CARs, Uzbekistan has the most complete code of foreign investment laws, followed by Kyrgyzstan, Kazakstan and Tajikistan, respectively. However, the investment codes are (a) generally unclear and often contradictory, (b) legal advice is difficult to obtain and (c) administrative and judicial support of the law is rudimentary in the CAR nations. Kazakstan leads the way in its development of mineral legislation amongst the CAR nations, whereas Tajikistan is the least developed. Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, respectively, have some recent legislation but have yet to develop the necessary protections and procedures to warrant investor confidence in their legislative and administrative schemes. Presently enacted mineral-related legislation in the Central Asian Nations is best regarded more as legislative `principles' rather than actual legislative, regulatory and administrative frameworks and procedures for mineral development. As a result most foreign investors in the mineral sector are opting to negotiate detailed agreements with the government rather than to rely on the existing legislation.","Volume 24, Issue 2",June 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/2,74

"The US copper, lead, zinc, aluminum and iron and steel sectors exhibit increasing competition for their products from new materials such as plastics and ceramics. The likely result of that competition and increased recycling is a decline in domestic production from virgin materials. Parallel to these developments are continued strong efforts by industry to improve material handling and energy efficiencies, and to switch towards cleaner fuels. What are implications of these trends for material and energy use and CO2 emissions by the copper, lead, zinc, aluminum and iron and steel sectors? To answer this question, this paper presents a systems view of industrial activity in which the major raw materials and energy flows are traced through the five US metals sectors. Dynamic interrelationships among resource extraction, materials processing, fuel use and technological change are specified on the basis of time series data and engineering information. Projections of material, energy and CO2 emissions profiles are presented for the years 1990–2020. These projections include energy requirements by the energy sectors to supply various fuels and electricity for the five metals sectors.","Volume 24, Issue 1",March 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/1,75
"Many engineers doubt the relevance of Hotelling's r-percent rule for the rent to nonrenewable resources. Economists ought to be concerned about such doubt, as engineers are instrumental in decisions about the path of production. The current paper takes a simple perspective on mining investment to argue that an r-percent rule holds implicitly in engineers' choices which maximize the value of mineral deposits.","Volume 24, Issue 1",March 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/1,75
"Governments in most countries are owners of mineral rights. In order to exploit their natural resources efficiently, states are normally obliged to rely on private mining companies. The government has a challenging task when deciding which exploration opportunities to exercise now through licensing and which blocks to save for future exploration. A large inventory of proven reserves allows scheduling of the production of various deposits more efficiently. But generating proven oil and gas reserves ahead of time entails oil companies and the society incurring extra costs. The value of exploration for petroleum now must be weighted against the value of waiting. This paper uses concepts and methods from option pricing theory to evaluate exploration for deposits of non-renewable resources. Exploration licensing is valued as a compound option, ie as a call option on a call option to develop, with price as the uncertain variable. The Norwegian petroleum licensing framework is used as a background for the specific problem approached, but the problem is familiar to most governments acting as owners of natural resources. Since exploration strategy is the topic of this paper, it is natural to take a look at the many different economic functions exploration serves in order to put the problem in perspective before the model is presented—even though many of the value creating elements are difficult to assess numerically and implement in an economic model.","Volume 24, Issue 1",March 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/1,75
"The quantification of the depreciation of natural capital is fundamental to the evaluation of the sustainability of economic development. Several methods for calculating the depletion cost of natural resource stocks have been proposed and used, including net price, El-Serafy's depletion cost, sustainability price, transaction value and replacement cost. Miller and Upton have also shown how resource rent can be estimated using the market value of a firm's liabilities. The relation of resource rent to depletion cost is discussed. These alternative approaches and techniques are described and critiqued. The alternative methods are used to obtain estimates for the resource rent and depletion cost of Argentina's petroleum reserves with data derived from the privatization of Argentina's state-owned oil enterprise, YPF. The results are used to argue that two methods, net price and transactions, overvalue the resource rent of petroleum reserves and to support the derivation of rent from the value of a firm's stock.","Volume 24, Issue 1",March 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/1,75
"This paper provides a brief overview of decision and preference analysis concepts and demonstrates an application of these techniques to the project-valuation problem faced by resource managers. Our major focus is on the use of the exponential utility function, the utility function most frequently used by resource companies. We discuss the important and practical risk-sharing problem faced by managers in the resource sector, that is, how to choose the optimal share of a risky project. We demonstrate that with decision and preference analysis tools it can be quite straightforward for managers to identify their optimal share in risky projects. We then explore these techniques further and demonstrate that they can lead to some seemingly counter-intuitive results. In particular, we explore how the firm's optimal share changes with exogeneous changes in project parameters. What we find is that while many of the changes in share are intuitive, some are not. In fact, when the firm's estimate of the potential upside payoff upon finding reserves increases, it is sometimes better to decrease the firm's share than it is to increase it. This is important, because by recognizing this counter-intuitive result, we can work to improve our intuition by understanding it. We summarize our findings and offers some guidelines resource managers should consider when considering a choice of utility function.","Volume 24, Issue 1",March 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/1,75
"One of the better-known anomalies of the international coal trade is the wide disparity in delivered coal prices into major markets. This disparity is particularly noticeable in Japan, the largest market. In Australia, the largest supplier to Japan (and the world), the dominant theory explaining the significantly lower delivered price for Australian coal relative to other major supplying nations has been the `bilateral monopoly' theory. This postulates that an increased surplus available from the trade due to savings in freight costs because of proximity is shared between Japanese buyers and Australian sellers. This article examines the application of the theory made by Bowen and Gooday (1993)which shows a roughly equal distribution of the surplus from the trade in the period 1980–1990. This examination shows that major assumptions with respect to exogenously determined upper and lower prices within which bargaining between the parties occurs cannot be sustained. Small adjustments to the bargaining range produce results which show an unequal distribution of the surplus which consistently favours buyers over the period. The latter part of the article examines a series of trading practices and differences in the composition of capital which may explain the long-term differences in bargaining power between the parties.","Volume 24, Issue 1",March 1998,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/24/issue/1,75
"Dutch disease and, more recently, resource curse thesis have been critical issues for development of resource abundant economies. This paper attempts a comparison between Indonesia and Mexico in their policy adjustments to the oil boom with special reference to the Dutch disease. There exists a striking contrast, especially in their fiscal, foreign borrowing, and exchange rate policies, and confirms the conventional understanding that a booming government should be conservative, as was the case in Indonesia, in its macroeconomic management to avoid the Dutch disease. Equally significant, investment use of oil revenues to strengthen the tradable sector is another factor responsible for Indonesian success. Mexico provides a clear-cut example of the resource curse thesis, but Indonesia is an exception.","Volume 23, Issue 4",December 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/23/issue/4,76
"Successful management in competitive markets requires evaluation methods that respond to global market dynamics and provide investors with relevant information to make strategic investment decisions. These strategic decisions include decisions on investment timing, feasibility study and risk management and mine operating options. Conventional methods do not have the built-in capabilities to help investors handle these strategic issues. Advances in modern finance have had profound impacts on financial markets for options, futures and collaterized securities and offer appropriate tools in solving these problems. In this paper, the authors have extended the Brennan and Schwartz mineral resource model to develop the derivative mine valuation method based on the dynamic arbitrage theory. A copper mining venture has been evaluated using the derivative mine valuation and conventional methods. The results show that the derivative mine valuation method allows investors to maximize the venture's market value by exercising these strategic options.","Volume 23, Issue 4",December 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/23/issue/4,76

We use the Keynesian multiplier theory as a theoretical framework to evaluate the potential results of an increase in waste recycling on the gross national product, the balance of payments and employment. In such a way the policy maker can better evaluate whether to promote the process considered here rather than discharging the waste in the environment.","Volume 23, Issue 4",December 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/23/issue/4,76

The results support the HVP which specifies that the value of any mineral reserve may be predicted by the market price of the resource, net of extraction costs. Regression results also indicate that a Box-Cox transformation of variables provide a better means of estimating the functional relationship between the value of an exhaustible natural resource and its market price.","Volume 23, Issue 4",December 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/23/issue/4,76
"Recent studies have found an inverse correlation between economic growth and natural resource abundance among developing countries. There appears to be no obvious explanation for this finding, such as an important growth variable that is common in resource-poor countries and deficient in resource-abundant countries. The resource curse hypothesis is closely related to the problem of sustainability for resource-exporting countries since periods of high growth are frequently followed by long periods of stagnation. Models are examined showing how increases in export income can affect relative prices in the trade and nontrade sectors and how the changes in relative prices affect investment and growth. It is the thesis of this article that there is nothing inherent in resource-abundance that condemns countries to either low growth or nonsustainability.","Volume 23, Issue 4",December 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/23/issue/4,76
"This paper considers the question of whether a government can switch tax regimes from an ad valorem royalty to a resource rent tax (RRT) in a manner which preserves a company's optimal investment level but which also increases expected tax revenue. A model of optimal investment to extract a resource of unknown size is developed which specifies the conditions required for such a switch of tax regimes to be investment-preserving. However, a comparison of expected tax revenues under the two regimes is analytically ambiguous. Consequently the model is analysed numerically, which produces the conclusion that expected tax revenue can be increased by an investment-preserving RRT in the situation where extracting the resource deposit is expected to be relatively profitable. Moreover, in this situation the increase in expected tax revenue appears to be positively related to the level of the threshold rate of return under the RRT. However, in the situation where extracting the resource deposit is expected to be relatively unprofitable and relatively uncertain, the expected tax revenues from the two tax regimes are less divergent.","Volume 23, Issue 3",September 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/23/issue/3,77
"The US glass industry produces a wide variety of products for industrial and end use purposes. Towards that end, large amounts of raw materials are extracted and used, energy is degraded and pollutants are generated and released into the environment. The industry has long recognized its influence on material cycles and energy flows through the economy-environment system. It is now in the process of adopting a systems perspective to tackle the problems associated with its material and energy use. To operationalize that systems perspective a dynamic computer model of the container, flat and fiberglass sectors of the industry is developed on the basis of time series data, engineering information and insights from industry experts. The model includes the extraction stage of the main raw materials, transportation of raw materials and discarded products — both back to producers and to ladfills — and the various manufacturing processes of the desired products.

"The paper provides an overview of the Japanese integrated steel mills' procurement policies for coking coal during the past three decades and the economic rationale underpinning them. Following an analysis of recent developments in the Japanese coking coal market, the direction of future change to those policies is examined using a diversity index. The diversity analysis shows that Japan's procurement policies have become less diversified in recent years as a result of changing technology and institutional structure. The implication for coking coal producers is that changing technologies have had, and will continue to have, strong influences on demand for coal used in steel making and hence the source of supply. Moreover, as the market becomes more competitive, ability to provide the right products at competitive prices, rather than the existing institutional arrangements, will be the main determinant of market share.","Volume 23, Issue 3",September 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/23/issue/3,77

After Ghana obtained independence from Britain in 1957, the basic framework of mineral rights was revised and a new regime established. The state became owner of minerals in the ground. State enterprises were involved in production and marketing of minerals. A restrictive exchange control regime and high fiscal imposts affected the mining sector. A radical change of policy has occurred since 1983, aimed at encouraging and regulating both large and small-scale mining for export. An increased portion of revenue from mining is being allocated to the communities directly affected by the operations.

"Zimbabwe's economic geology features hydrothermal deposits and therefore, while its mines are generally small, it has several hundred formal operations. Initially the mining law was exceptionally facilitative by African standards, although it has since been rendered more sensitive to other rural interests. At first, too, the colonial administration imposed crippling rents on output but their self-defeating nature led to their abandonment. Three main features of mineral policy have emerged since independence in 1980: (1) state participation in production and supervision of sales; (2) specific regimes for some artisanal mining; (3) ad hoc arrangements for the legal and financial environments of major foreign investors; and (4) the withdrawal of mining-specific tax benefits. Zimbabwe has been seen as a model for other African countries with similar resources but with negligible formal mining sectors.

"This paper discusses the mining development policies in Chile in the period 1974–1996. This period includes the military government that took over the country from socialist President Allende in 1973, and the return to democracy with the election of President Aylwin in 1989 and of President Frei in 1993. The paper analyses the economic and mining policies of the military and democratic periods, and then the country's mining investment, production and exports under the prism of the main institutional development policies pursued. The analysis focuses on copper mining, where investment and growth have created a mining boom unprecedented worldwide in this century since the discovery of the flotation process in the early 1900s. Thus it is of special relevance to examine the set of circumstances that has made this boom possible. The main discussion during this period regards the legitimacy of foreign investment in mining vs the capacity and potential of the state-owned company Codelco to be a protagonist of mining development. While the more liberal sectors of the political spectrum have supported the privatization of Codelco, the more conservative sectors support the continued ownership of Codelco by the state. This discussion will be of no great consequence if the mining boom continues. Nevertheless aspects of the discussion in 1996 questioned the economic development model employed by the country since 1974.Crucial for the legitimacy of foreign investment is the assessment of the returns that the country is receiving from mining investment. Two studies released in 1996 conclude that the overall effects of foreign investment in mining are positive at the national and regional levels and that a Dutch disease scenario does not seem probable for the future. Moreover, it is evident that had the mining boom not occurred, the country's economic growth would have been lower during the period 1988–1996. It also seems clear that the military government did not have identifiable viable options for a potentially successful mining policy at the time when the great policy decisions were taken. This has been validated by the policies adopted by the two democratic governments in more recent years. This does not signify that all is perfect. Indeed there are policy changes to be adopted, but they seem to be directed at adjusting the model so that the country improves its returns rather than upsetting the whole economic-institutional model.","Volume 23, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-101 (June 1997)",June 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/23/issue/1,78
"In recent decades the Chinese Government has made considerable effort to create and update an effective mineral-policy system to achieve its objectives for the mineral industries. This system consists of a number of laws, regulations and regulatory documents. This article focuses on the major aspects of the existing system of national mineral policy, including the fundamental principles underlying policy formulation; the framework of mining legislation; descriptions of the newly amended Mineral Resources Law, general policy on foreign investment in the mineral sector, mining taxation and the overall tax burden, and regimes for mine environmental management; the structure and roles of government agencies; and changes in the structure of the mineral sector.

"Papua New Guinea has had more than 20 years of large-scale mineral development experience. Over the years, mineral development has become more and more contentious, not for reasons that relate directly to mining activities, but reasons that relate to the distribution of mineral returns in the country. The State owns the minerals and therefore is entitled to returns from mineral development. The State, however, grants rights to exploration and mining over customary lands and has to compensate customary landholders. How much compensation is part of the ongoing debate. The situation is given an added dimension by the political structure of the country. Provincial government becomes the third party in the distribution list and have their own set of demands for mineral development. It is hoped that the problems of distribution of mineral returns do not end up in policy changes that drive away the much sought after foreign investment.","Volume 23, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-101 (June 1997)",June 1997,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/23/issue/1,78
"Investment in Western Australia's mining and mineral-processing industries is currently surging. This stems from new opportunities for downstream processing provided by the deregulation of energy markets technological innovation and East Asia's increasing demands for minerals. This paper examines the macroeconomic impacts of this investment using three complementary approaches: (i) The main features of 35 mining and mineral-processing projects which are already under way or committed to proceed are analysed in detail. This covers the value, timing of and direct employment associated with these projects. (ii) The flow-on benefits of the projects are estimated using multiplier techniques. (iii) The broader effects of the projects are simulated using a new economy-wide model of the WA economy.Major findings of the paper include: &#x02022;The total value of the 35 projects is estimated to be $5.8 billion, which when annualised becomes $3.6 billion p.a.&#x02022;These projects will generate approximately 9000 new jobs directly during the construction phase.&#x02022;According to multiplier computations, between 16 000 and 18 000 new jobs will be generated elsewhere in the economy by the 35 projects during the construction period. Taking the midpoint of this range of 17 000, the results indicate that total employment increases approximately by 9000 + 17 000 = 26 000 jobs.&#x02022;The WA Model (WAM), a new general equilibrium model of the Western Australian economy, indicates that the new investment will create approximately 39 000 new jobs in the WA economy during the construction phase. The 39 000 jobs projected by WAM refer to both direct and indirect employment; this figure differs from the multiplier estimate of 26 000 due to the more extensive economic linkages included in WAM.&#x02022;WAM also indicates that about 22 000 new jobs in the production phase will be created by the new projects. These new jobs continue over the working lives of these projects.&#x02022;In the construction phase, exports are projected to fall by about 12% due to a significant real appreciation of the exchange rate caused by a rise in domestic costs. However, as the projects commence operations, WA exports will be about 5% higher than otherwise.&#x02022;During the construction phase, industries which service the projects by supplying materials are projected to expand the most. The major exporting industries, and those closely related to export activities, contract as they are squeezed by the real appreciation of the exchange rate. However, the overall income and spending growth that accompanies the construction of the projects causes many service industries and import-competing industries to expand.&#x02022;During the production phase, the four mining and mineral-processing industries where the majority of the investment takes place are projected to expand output the most. In this phase, there are only modest cost pressures and significant growth in income. Consequently, almost all industries in WA will grow with most of the new jobs being created in industries other than mining and mineral processing. This shows that the effects of the projects are much broader than might initially thought to be the case.","Volume 22, Issue 4",December 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/22/issue/4,79
"As with several other metals, the recession of the early 1990s combined with events in the former Soviet Union, placed major strains on the world nickel market and made the operation of several established mines uneconomic. The subsequent world economic recovery, combined with the emergence of new mining and processing technologies, seems at face value to have opened the way for new and expanded nickel mines in Western Australia to expand their share of world production. Against the background of an established oligopolistic market structure and major nickel finds elsewhere, this study assesses the likelihood of major new nickel developments taking place.","Volume 22, Issue 4",December 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/22/issue/4,79
"The wish on the part of many governments to decrease the overall level of their expenditure, coupled with the desire to ensure that science is made more relevant to national priorities, is driving many of the changes occurring in science. In Britain ‘market forces’, including contracting out, market testing and privatization, have been used as mechanisms for changing institutional and ownership arrangements. There have been a number of gains from this approach but there have also been significant costs. The search for relevance has resulted in a number of countries undertaking technology foresight exercises. Most of them follow a similar methodology, though the UK exercise is notable for its size and scope. The trend towards ‘outsourcing’ of research by many private industries has received less attention than it deserves in terms of national science policy, for it is a fundamental change in the way that industry obtains its science. Unless ‘outsourcing’ is supported by well-established national and international research and training networks, it could result in problems for some industries in the longer term. Scientific institutions in the public sector will be increasingly dependent on a range of funding sources and a model is presented that provides a framework within which the requirements of the public and private sectors can be accommodated while still maintaining scientific excellence, impartiality and credibility and offering the opportunity to address public-good issues. It is likely in the future that the countries most effectively exploiting their science base will have undertaken successful foresight exercises. They will also have established strong links between research and its application by developing comprehensive and effective national research and training networks that also link into global networks. These will be supported by well-defined institutional arrangements, including intermediate institutes with a specific responsibility for undertaking strategic and applied science underpinned by basic research and for maintaining and strengthening networks.","Volume 22, Issue 3",September 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/22/issue/3,80
"It has long been recognized that applications of the net present value (NPV) investment decision making methodology can have serious deficiencies in situations where investment can be delayed and, once made, future decisions allow increases or decreases in the level of output. While the necessity of period by period analysis is sometimes acknowledged, little if any practical illustrative model building has been published to date, aside from algorithms using continuous time stochastic processes which appear difficult to implement.

"One goal of this paper is to develop a model that explains metal consumption over time by the trends in world economic activity. Two alternative models of this relationship are examined over the 1950 through 1994 period for world consumption of aluminium, copper, lead and zinc. Another goal is to determine if there has been an unusual recent surge in the demand for these metals. Total world metal consumption is well explained by the first model which relates metal use to world activity in a few general macroeconomic sectors. However, in many situations even greater aggregation and simplification is required by the lack of recent economic data, resulting in the second model which is the intensity of use method. Both of these models are used to make metal consumption predictions. Comparing actual metal use against the predictions from the models demonstrates that in 1993 and 1994 there was some degree of unexpected and unusually high levels of demand for copper, lead and zinc, but only slightly so for aluminium. A detailed analysis of the demand for copper in 32 nations shows that there does not appear to be any simple explanation as to why some nations have had unusually high rates of copper use, whereas other nations have had unusually low consumption.","Volume 22, Issue 3",September 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/22/issue/3,80
"Despite the widespread research on metal demand in recent years, there is little in the professional literature on the demand for construction materials and other non-fuel, non-metallic minerals. A recent and interesting exception is Humphreys (1994), which finds that intersectoral shifts in the UK economy favouring the service sector at the expense of the manufacturing sector have had a negative influence on the intensity of metal use but a positive influence on the intensity of use of construction materials. As a result, the latter has changed very little in the UK over the past 30 years while the former has declined dramatically. In an attempt to determine if Humphreys's findings apply to other countries as well, this study extends his analysis to the USA. The results are quite different. The intensity of use for construction materials has declined dramatically over the past 30 years, more so than the intensity of metal use. Moreover, intersectoral shifts—the decline of manufacturing and the rise of services—appear to influence intensity of use trends for both metals and construction materials less than resource saving technology, material substitution and intrasectoral shifts within the manufacturing sector.","Volume 22, Issue 3",September 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/22/issue/3,80
"This paper applies the extraction R&D model in examining the effects of non-conventional fuel tax credits on natural gas reserves and extraction in southwestern and northeastern New Mexico, the second largest deposits of natural gas in the USA. Testable implications of both market prices and R&D effort are specified in an empirical supply function for natural gas. The findings of the paper indicate marginal R&D costs closely parallel real wellhead prices and are an important element in explaining natural gas reserves and extraction. The policy implication is that non-conventional fuel tax credits affected both natural gas reserves and extraction activity via their influence on R&D behaviour.","Volume 22, Issue 3",September 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/22/issue/3,80
"Since the 1950s a transport revolution has occurred comparable to events in the late nineteenth century when sailing ships was replaced by steam vessels. Freight rates for bulk products have decreased 65–70% due to improved maritime technology. Formerly separate markets for bulk products have been unified globally. A conclusion is that the low freight rates since the early 1980s will level out in a future perspective. Price peaks caused by political and military crises like the Korean war, the Suez crisis, OPEC I and OPEC II also seem to be of diminishing importance over time. The world market has become much less sensitive to external shocks due to many alternative sources of supply and many alternative routes for transport.","Volume 22, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-140 (March–June 1996)",March–June 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/22/issue/1,81

"The analysis show how the Swedish iron ore producer, LKAB, in spite of mining its ore underground in an arctic climate at relatively high costs, has remained internationally competitive thanks to its large-scale operation with high grade magnetite ore, pelletization and relatively short distance to both its shipping harbour and its international markets. LKAB starts at a relatively high level on the supply curve with respect to mining costs, but as the analysis continues to describe, LKAB moves gradually downwards on the supply curve on delivered pellet costs. The analysis clearly shows that LKAB has successfully managed to find its comparative advantage and that its competitive strength is sustainable, primarily thanks to its rich deposits of magnetite ore.","Volume 22, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-140 (March–June 1996)",March–June 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/22/issue/1,81

In this paper, we survey DCF and more recent methods of evaluating cyclical projects. We then discuss why traditional techniques systematically undervalue mining assets and suggest that valuations based on option theory can at least partially remedy this situation. Finally, we construct an example that shows how the theory of options can be used to value flexible responses to price and technological uncertainty. Our example is calibrated using data from recently opened Canadian copper mines.","Volume 22, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-140 (March–June 1996)",March–June 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/22/issue/1,81

"Though sustainable development is a relatively recent addition to the public lexicon, concern that resource depletion may threaten the welfare of future generations dates back at least to Thomas Malthus and other classical economists writing nearly two centuries ago. Today the debate over this threat not only continues, but seems more polarized than ever. In one school are the concerned, often ecologists and other scientists and engineers, who contend the earth cannot for long continue to support current and anticipated levels of demand for oil and other exhaustible resources. In the opposing school are the unconcerned, often economists, who claim with equal conviction that the earth with the help of market incentives, appropriate public policies, and new technology can amply provide for society's needs for the indefinite future. That intelligent and informed individuals remain so divided on such an important issue for the future of humanity after years of debate is surprising. The explanation, at least in part, appears to lie with the very different paradigms adopted by the two different groups coupled with quite contrasting views on the beneficence of technology, public policy and the marketplace. The two competing paradigms lead to quite different outlooks on the human condition and in turn on recommendations for public policy.","Volume 22, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-140 (March–June 1996)",March–June 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/22/issue/1,81
"Europe's mining industry has a long, profitable and varied history. Now held in low regard for largely fallacious reasons, it faces many challenges. In reality, its spread and diversity surprise. Although Europe's mining industry accounts for a small share of GDP, it provides a significant share of the global production of many products. The European industry stands favourable comparison with that of the USA. It is relatively weak in many metallic products, and has a strong industrial minerals bias. Some features of the industry flow from its long history. These include a legacy of state ownership and incipient protectionism, as well as complex land ownership and mineral rights. Exploration spending is relatively low for readily understood reasons, but Europe does have many prospectively good projects, even in metals. The main obstacles are in the arena of planning controls and environmental regulation, which are global rather than specifically European issues.

"Minimill steel companies-re;atively small, efficient producers that use electric furnaces to melt scrap or directly reduced iron ore - have steadily increased their share of US steel production from about 5% in 1970 to more than 35% today, forcing the closure of numerous integrated facilities over this period. Although these minimills received a stimulus from weak scrap prices in the 1980s, their continued success is attributable to lower labour and capital construction costs and steady improvements in electric furnace and rolling technology. Minimills have not yet spread widely to OECD countries outside North America, but they are likely to emerge in these countries unless governments attempt to block them in order to protect their declining large, integrated steel companies.","Volume 22, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-140 (March–June 1996)",March–June 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/22/issue/1,81
"This paper examines the export implications for natural gas and aluminium of Russia's ongoing economic transition. The rapid run-up in aluminium exports and the formation of a large capacity surplus (‘bubble’) in natural gas are seen as a direct result of the drastic shifts in the level and mix of aggregate demand, and the marked rise in the real price of these commodities. Based on a set of macroeconomic, structural and price assumptions, the paper provides a set of quantitative projections for the prospective evolution of Russian domestic demand for aluminium and gas, and draws out the potential implications for the international markets. For natural gas, the capacity hangover is seen to deflate by 2000, in tandem with the buildup of domestic consumption. In the case of aluminium, the recently experienced ‘export bubble’ is predicted to ease back gradually, and eventually disappear by 2005.","Volume 22, Issues 1–2, Pages 1-140 (March–June 1996)",March–June 1996,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/22/issue/1,81

"We use a complete record of daily price quotations from the London Metal Exchange (the LME) to construct a set of monthly volatility measures over the 24-year period 1972–1995 for the six LME metals-aluminium, copper, nickel, lead, tin and zinc (data are from 1983–1995 for aluminium and nickel). Despite a widely held opinion to the contrary, volatility has shown no tendency to increase over this period. In particular, except in the case of tin, volatility levels were beneath their historic average levels over 1993–1995, a period of increased speculative interest in the metals markets. Nevertheless, volatility is itself very volatile. We develop a model which relates metals volatility to the metals balance, as manifest in the stock-consumption ratio. This model appears to account for much of the medium-term movement in volatility, in particular in the aluminium, nickel and zinc markets. The model attributes the modest rise in volatilities over 1993–1995 relative to 1990–1992 to tighter metals balances.","Volume 21, Issue 4",December 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/4,82
"Japan is the world's largest steel producing country, and around half of its total input requirements for coking coal and iron ore are sourced from Australia. Moreover, around half of Australia's total coking coal and iron ore exports go to Japan each year. Therefore, changes in the demand for these two inputs are likely to have a significant impact on Australia. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the production structure of the blast furnaces in Japan and factors affecting the demand for iron making raw materials. The empirical study is based on the generalized Leontief cost function. Because of its functional flexibility, the model allows testing various hypotheses regarding pig iron production from blast furnaces. Based on the data from 1974 to 1991, the modelling results show that the Japanese ironmaking technology, when considered as an aggregate production process using fuel and iron ore as major inputs, could be characterized by fixed factor proportions, constant returns to scale and technical changes that can be explained by systematic changes in input mix. Moreover, while there is little variation in the iron ore usage rate, variations in fuel usage rate can be explained largely by changes in the make-up of iron ore charge and blast furnace production capacity over the sample period.","Volume 21, Issue 4",December 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/4,82
"Technological innovation has been an important source of continued improvement in the hydrocarbon discovery rate. A historical analysis of the drilling activity on Canada's Scotian Shelf, suggesting diminishing returns to innovation, is used to illustrate the impact innovation has had on the discovery rate. The effects of introduced technological innovation are then generalized using a simulation model. The model relies on geologic data and treats the probability of discovery as proportional to pool size and the number of pools remaining to be discovered. A discovery efficiency parameter representing the degree of technical sophistication is included in the model. By varying the parameter in repeated experiments, inferences about the implications of technological innovation can be made. Results indicate that although early improvements in exploration technology are capable of improving the discovery rate, these improvements do not maximize discoverable volumes when a minimum economic discovery size rule is used to determine when exploration activity ceases. Furthermore, such innovations do not contribute to attaining sustainable resource use because they result in accelerated depletion of the resource base.","Volume 21, Issue 4",December 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/4,82
"Hedonic pricing models were developed and estimated econometrically to investigate the impact of quality variables on hard coking coal prices in the Japanese market. The results show that the hedonic pricing approach can provide a useful method for evaluating price-quality relations for non-homogeneous products such as hard coking coal. Based on coking coal contract data, the analysis shows that while quality differentials account for a large part of the price variation in hard coking coal, there is a major difference in the way Australian and Canadian hard coking coals are priced. However, this result does not necessarily imply the existence of discriminatory pricing. This is because the current analysis is limited by its ability to account for the complexity of price negotiation process and the difficulty in quantifying non-quality related variables.","Volume 21, Issue 4",December 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/4,82

They conclude that because of the market structure of electricity, dominated by vertically-integrated organizations, there is no need for futures contracts. In this article we show that the hedging effectiveness of electricity futures is high compared with traditional commodities such as crude oil. Introducing electricity futures will therefore change the market structure of the electricity business.

"A utility methodology to identify profitable market segments for the use of new materials is presented and illustrated by application to the automobile industry. The method has three parts: empirical, statistical and analytical. The first measures company preferences for the important attributes of a use of a material, applying single-attribute utility functions. The second identifies market segments, by determining significant differences between measured preferences with t-tests. The third estimates the premium these market segments would pay for a product made of a new material, using multiattributable utilities, and thus determines profitable market segments. The case study of valve trains containing ceramic components defined two market segments: companies with either a broad world market or a narrow speciality. The immediate buyers of these valve trains are likely to be producers of high-value, six-cylinder automobiles, who seem prepared to pay a significant premium for this product.","Volume 21, Issue 3",September 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/3,83
"Although relative production costs of nickel from laterite and sulphide deposits have changed during the period 1988 to 1994, cash break even costs of the average sulphide producer remain below those of the average laterite producer. Sulphide producers have higher direct production costs but lower net production costs because of significant byproduct credits. However, total costs, which include capital, are now equal for the average laterite and sulphide producers. Relative production costs have been influenced by simultaneous yearly changes in byproduct and nickel prices, oil prices and exchange rates as well as real changes in actual production, transport and capital investments. In the absence of major shifts in energy or byproduct prices, the average sulphide producer will continue to experience lower cash operating costs gained through capital investments than the average laterite producer. This suggests that the average nickel sulphide operation is more able to withstand cyclic nickel price downturns.","Volume 21, Issue 3",September 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/3,83

"Recent calls for sustainable practices in industry have highlighted the need to assess the interrelationships between changes in industrial material and energy use, availability and quality of material and energy sources, and emissions. This study provides such an assessment for the US iron and steel industry. It quantifies these relationships using econometric time series analysis of aggregate industry behaviour. The econometric estimates, together with engineering information on production technologies, are embedded in a dynamic computer model and used to simulate material and energy use and emissions profiles for the period 1987–2027. The results indicate that even modest increases in raw steel production rates require unrealistically high rates of iron and steel recycling to reduce energy use and emissions in the long run, even if the historically observed rates of technological substitution and efficiency improvements can be maintained.","Volume 21, Issue 3",September 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/3,83

"In recent years, there has been a widespread disengagement of government from the non-fuel mining industry and a progressive globalization of the markets for mineral-based products. Associated with these developments has gone a loss in the industrialized countries of the ‘strategic’ perception of minerals and of concern over their security of supply. For the most part this is to be welcomed since direct government involvement in the industry frequently led to inefficiencies and distortions. However, it also carries risks. The mining industry has certain highly specific characteristics and the elaboration of good policy on minerals development continues to require the employment by government of those who understand these characteristics. Furthermore, an increased dependence on the global market needs to be matched by an increased awareness in government of the conditions governing world trade in mineral raw materials and the procurement policies of other countries.","Volume 21, Issue 2",June 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/2,84
"Security of energy supply, and employment considerations are frequently said to provide major justifications for the colossal subsidies to West European coal production. This paper scrutinizes the validity of the two motives. The production cut following from subsidy elimination would result in a very small change of West European energy self-sufficiency, with doubtful repercussions on supply security. The impact on the region's employment would be barely perceptible. Germany stands out as the country that would be most heavily affected by coal subsidy elimination. Even in Germany, however, the public support expended on coal could be put to much more efficient alternative use for the promotion of energy supply security and employment creation. It is concluded that the two motives for coal support lack validity.","Volume 21, Issue 2",June 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/2,84
"Despite substantial falls in lead emissions and ambient air lead levels over the last two decades, it remains valuable to attempt to estimate the costs of lead induced health effects. We consider the epidemiological framework assembled by Ostro (1994) to estimate the mortality costs of lead emissions in England and Wales. Unfortunately, the required data are sparse. However, the Ostro methodology is deterministic, to the extent that if we have the necessary data for a single year, then we can estimate deviations from that year on the assumption that other population characteristics are unchanged. We demonstrate how gaps in the 1992 data can be filled using the 1987 dataset. This enables us to estimate the mortality costs to urban adult males in England and Wales to have been approximately £70 million in 1992. We alsoconsider the robustness of this result.","Volume 21, Issue 2",June 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/2,84
"This paper provides estimates of mineral depletion in Brazil, and their implication for the measurement of sustainable income for the mineral sector, during the period 1970–1988. Two alternative approaches are briefly reviewed: the net price approach and the user cost approach. Estimates of sustainable income from mineral extraction in Brazil are computed using both techniques, and the results obtained vary significantly between them. Estimates obtained with the user cost approach are of the same order of magnitude as conventionally measured income, with differences explained in terms of the time horizon of extraction. With the net price approach, on the other hand, large oscillations in sustainable income reflect variation in the underlying estimates of mineral reserves.","Volume 21, Issue 2",June 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/2,84
"This article summarizes the current issues in the ‘limits to growth’ controversy. It argues that the debate is meaningless unless participants define world growth, specify the non-substitutable natural resources essential to world growth and the outlook for their availability, and rigorously examine whether growth, as opposed to no growth, must inevitably reduce the productivity of the environmental assets that make life possible. It also concludes that the timeframe for limits to growth should be finite — no more than a century — since uncertainties with respect to technology and physical developments are so great as to make predictions to the indefinite future valueless.","Volume 21, Issue 2",June 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/2,84
"The characteristics of commodity exchanges are outlined. The need of the buyer to accept delivery from a warehouse selected by the seller constrains the geographical reach of an exchange. LME extended its warehouse network from 1960 to 1991 to the continent, Scandinavia, the Mediterranean, Singapore, Japan and the USA. The actual use of the warehouses from 1992 to September 1995 is studied by location and region. Japan is problematic, the USA holds promise, Singapore is gratifying and Europe is doing very well. The youth of the overseas locations, combined with the industry structure of their regional economies, explains much.

"The internationalization of environmental interest groups, especially within the minerals sector, has long been a recognized fact. The factors that may account for this have attracted little attention. This paper will examine both how and why environmental interest groups internationalize. Various factors thought to influence the formation of interest groups across national borders have been closely analysed. Trade, exchange rates, and transport are just some of the many variables which influence the formation and activity of these entities. We believe that interest group formation generally, and environmental interest groups specifically, may be more usefully scrutinized in light of the politics and theory of political social movements.","Volume 21, Issue 1",March 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/1,85
"Organization of and communication among environmental interest groups can result in the formation of environmental coalitions. These coalitions, in conjunction with governmental support for increased public participation, have changed the public policy milieu within which mining industries must function in North America. Opposition by environmental interests has increased the complexity of mine project development, consequently increasing the time and cost of implementation and creating greater risk for the developer. The Windy Craggy issue is a highly visible example of this phenomenon. An organized environmental coalition responded quickly to the proposed Windy Craggy mine in north-western British Columbia. Efforts by proponents to counter negative publicity were inadequate and late. Pressure from the public and environmental interests played major roles in the rejection of the project, a decision with significant repercussions for the entire Canadian mining sector.","Volume 21, Issue 1",March 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/1,85

It reviews the climate for the mining industry, changing institutions and values, interest group positions in the province, and evaluative processes used by all levels of government. at the time. The project rejection was influenced by contemporaneous provincial policy innovations of promoting non-economic values, strengthening citizen involvement in decision making, and creating a new suite of legislation to better protect the environment. These factors, along with the negative international opinion, contributed to the rejection of the proposal.","Volume 21, Issue 1",March 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/1,85
"This paper examines the functions of national geological surveys in the 1990s. Based on questionnaire responses to a global survey, it concludes that the public agency role of a geological survey is often broader than merely gathering and disseminating geological information to publicize geological potential. The paper identifies the current functions of a wide cross-section of national geological surveys to better determine both the types of roles they fulfil and the policy and regulatory structure in which they operate. Key topics addressed include the historic roles of a national geological survey, major current functions, mineral exploration role, services provided to the private sector, structural changes and regulatory responsibilities. Worldwide, national geological surveys are examining their missions and implementing changes. The paper warns that there is no one ideal global set of functions for geological surveys to carry out; functions must be carefully selected and implemented keeping in mind the unique attributes and needs of the nation.","Volume 21, Issue 1",March 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/1,85

The analysis exploits a new time series/cross-section data set on trade purchases of jewellery in six developed countries, using a seemingly unrelated regression (SURE) model. We find direct price elasticities in the range −0.5 to −1.0, and some evidence of speculative purchases ahead of expected price changes.","Volume 21, Issue 1",March 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/1,85

The purpose of this paper is to construct and empirically test a model designed to determine the impact, if any, of expected excess capacity on the probability of firm entry into the US titanium metal industry. Using vector autoregressive estimation techniques along with logit models, results are generated which indicate that expected levels of excess capacity served as an effective barrier to entry.","Volume 21, Issue 1",March 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/1,85
"Assuming free entry of firms to public lands and the consequent diminishment of their value as pure wilderness, there is an administered price per acre that fosters the theoretically efficient level of commercial use, such as mining, grazing or logging. That price equals households' marginal willingness to pay to preserve the public land as wilderness. It also equals the efficient price of private land times the ratio of the marginal commercial productivities of public to private land. The exceptions are the corner solutions in which the administered price either equals the marginal willingness to pay for wilderness, but exceeds the marginal revenue product of the land, in which case none of the land is used commercially, or else equals the marginal revenue product, but exceeds the marginal willingness to pay, in which case all of the land is used commercially.","Volume 21, Issue 1",March 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/1,85
"The current paper highlights the lack of any framework for the analysis of the effects of current methods of rate of return regulation on the target firms and proposes an alternative method based on the market cost of the capital invested in a regulated firm. Using a framework developed from an earlier model, the effects of a uniform profit margin (UPM) on the efficiencies of oil firms are examined. The results show that the effects depend on the type of firm and on whether the UPM is below or above the firm's capital expansion rate (CER). Essentially, UPM will make the most efficient firms (MEFs) operate at a lower or higher efficiency level depending on whether they are below or above their CER; make accelerated cost firms (ACFs) more inefficient in terms of higher supernormal profits at the expense of society; and make accelerated production firms (APFs) more efficient, provided there are no restrictions on the firms' choice of method of adjusting production rates. In general, the approach encourages firms that have less than desirable investment levels to raise the level, and discourages excessive investment for the sole aim of reaping higher profits.","Volume 21, Issue 1",March 1995,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/21/issue/1,85
"Using the Zambian copper industry as a case study, this article develops a simple econometric model to assess the relative importance of two groups of factors contributing to the generally poor performance of state mining enterprises since the mid-1970s. It finds that factors inhibiting investment and capacity, such as the confiscation of copper revenues by the government for other social needs, play an important role in explaining the decline of the Zambian copper industry. In contrast, factors contributing to inefficiency and poorer profit margins, including the pursuit of goals other than cost minimization and profit maximization, are not significant.","Volume 20, Issue 4",December 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/4,86
"This paper reviews the development of the Chinese steel industry over the past few decades and its impact on the international steel market. The steel industry has shown a trend to move away from industrialized countries to developing economies, especially some dynamic developing ones. China has played an important part in the relocation of the international steel industry. China is now the world's largest steel consumer and one of the largest steel producers and is rapidly industrializing. This rapid industrialization creates a huge demand for steel. Strong growth in demand, together with China's improving comparative advantage in steel production, has provided a favourable environment for the growth of the Chinese steel industry. This will accelerate the process of the relocation of the international steel industry, providing both opportunities and challenges for the international steel industry.","Volume 20, Issue 4",December 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/4,86
"Off-shore oil leases may be awarded by an auction system or by a system based on discretionary factors, such as the size of work programme. Companies' decisions on the optimal bid premium (in auctions) or optimal proposed work programme (in discretionary systems) are complicated by another choice variable: the amount of exploration to conduct prior to bidding or applying for the lease. It is demonstrated that in the case of auctioned oil leases pre-bid exploration may yield strategic benefits to the exploring company. In work programme based allocations, however, an expected reduction in resource uncertainty will not always improve the profitability of the optimal work programme, so that situations can be demonstrated where even costless exploration is ex ante unprofitable. Furthermore, allocation on the basis of work programme size risks awarding leases to companies with higher resource uncertainty and lower lease valuations. These are arguments demonstrating the merits of allocation by auction rather than by companies' declared work programmes.","Volume 20, Issue 4",December 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/4,86
"Prospects for export of liquified natural gas (LNG) from Alaska's North Slope are assessed. Projected market conditions to 2010 show that new LNG capacity beyond announced expansions will be needed to meet regional demand and that supplies will probably come from outside the region. The estimated delivered costs of likely suppliers show that Alaska North Slope gas will not be competitive. The alternative North Slope gas development strategies of transport and sale to the lower 48 states and use on the North Slope for either enhanced oil recovery or conversion to liquids are examined. The alternative options require delaying development until US gas prices increase, exhaustion of certain North Slope oil fields, or advances occur in gas to liquid fuels conversion technology.","Volume 20, Issue 4",December 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/4,86
"Much of the Asian Pacific region is characterized by both relatively high growth rates in electricity demand and a deficiency in domestic fossil fuel energy. One result has been the rapid expansion of regional seaborne trade in LNG and coal. This paper suggests that regional use of LNG will continue through this decade primarily due to incremental expansions at existing sites. Thereafter some combination of greenfield LNG units and greenfield gas development will be required. These new projects would be multibillion dollar investments that appear to require prices considerably higher than now typical to assure development. Consequently, LNG is likely to lose market opportunities in the post 2000 period unless consumers are willing to pay what could amount to a substantial premium over current prices for LNG.","Volume 20, Issue 4",December 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/4,86

After considering the policy and law in place in Namibia at its independence and reviewing the various new policy and institutional measures instituted by the government which came into power at independence, the article concludes that the Namibian model is worthy of consideration by other frontier provinces in the developing world because of the simplicity of the regime, the fact that it does not require excessive negotiation and responds to environmental concerns.","Volume 20, Issue 4",December 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/4,86
"Many developing countries are keen to promote investments in maritime areas that are subject to overlapping claims or are even the subject of sovereignty disputes. The link between attracting investment for development of such areas and the settlement of the dispute concerned is the delimitation of the boundaries of the area. The settlement of overlapping claims in maritime zones has led to the development of hard mineral and petroleum deposits in border areas. This has been clearly demonstrated in the North Sea and the Persian Gulf in the case of petroleum. Where there is a failure to settle overlapping claims, as in the South China Sea and Aegean Sea areas, investors tend to avoid such areas. However, in a growing number of cases, coastal states have resorted to the joint development of mineral deposits in areas of overlapping claims in the absence of an agreement to settle their claims, as is evidenced in the Red Sea region with respect to minerals (Sudan and Saudi Arabia) and the Timor Sea in the case of petroleum (Indonesia and Australia).","Volume 20, Issue 4",December 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/4,86
"A review of the green national accounts literature shows that there is little agreement on whether to adjust gross or net product, or on the sign of some of the adjustments proposed. A series of models is presented, following Weitzman, to examine the treatment in the national accounts of living resources, heterogeneous resource deposits, resource discoveries, environmental services, carbon emissions and defensive expenditures by households. A key conclusion is that expanding the accounts to include non-market environmental services results in a measure of welfare rather than product (although net national product is the starting point), and that the level of environmental services is an integral component of this welfare measure. These results are compared with the standard national accounts. Greener measures of wealth per capita and savings rates will have more policy relevance in gauging progress towards sustainable development than adjustments to national product.","Volume 20, Issue 3",September 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/3,87
"An analysis of the US automobile industry shows, through material flow diagrams, how an ‘industrial metabolism’ may be evaluated in terms of dissipative and cyclical flows. When these flows are categorized by material type and/or functional application area, they provide useful information for the investigation of environmental impacts, recycling rates, energy use etc. In this analysis, the entire material process, from mining to final disposal, was considered for a typical 1990 mid-sized automobile. When all five stages of the process were included, the dissipative flow (or residual) amounted to 40% of the initial material flow. This 40% includes both pre-product residuals, such as mining losses, and post-production residuals, such as automobile fluff. When only the post-production residuals are considered, the dissipative flow amounted to 21% of the initial material flow. When retirement of the 1990 automobile is considered over a period of 20 years, and the 21% dissipative flow value is used, the cumulative residuals sent to landfills will be approximately 5.8 billion lb.","Volume 20, Issue 3",September 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/3,87
"This paper identifies the problems of designing regulatory policy in the mineral resources industries and offers an alternative framework for overcoming such problems in the oil industry. But because there is currently no index for determining what combination of policy instruments to adopt to eliminate inefficiencies arising from the level of operation of producer firms, the paper proposes two indices - cost incentive policy effort (CIPE) and production incentive policy effort (PIPE) - that ensure that an optimal (most efficient) strategy in terms of requiring minimum effort and welfare loss is always chosen by policy makers. The indices indicate that optimal regulatory policy strategies are obtained by designing production increasing measures for accelerated cost firms, and cost increasing measures for accelerated production firms.","Volume 20, Issue 3",September 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/3,87

"The iron ore buying patterns of Japanese steel mills were examined based on a partial adjustment model. The analysis showed that, as a result of Japan's supply diversification policy, import costs were not a significant factor in determining market shares among major iron ore suppliers, including Australia, Canada and India. Specifically, Australia's share of Japanese iron ore imports had remained stable and was affected neither by changes in Japanese total imports nor by changes in relative import costs. In contrast, Brazil's market share was affected by changes in Japanese total imports only, while India's market share was affected by changes in relative import costs only. However, with increasing competition in the steel market and security of iron ore supply largely assured, import costs can be expected to play a greater role in determining future market shares of the major supplying countries.","Volume 20, Issue 2",June 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/2,88
"Since 1973, OPEC has been less and less successful in reconciling the individual and collective interests of the member states. Differences in oil reserves, production capacity, dependence on oil income and the degree of vertical integration have brought conflicting interests to light concerning price and production levels. In the last years, OPEC has been unable to strike dependable agreements on production among its member states; agreements were for public consumption only. OPEC has become a weak market regulator, and quite a few of its member states are in such severe economic peril that they cannot invest in new oil production capacities. The buyers' market has made for a weak oil price in recent years and oil income levels have declined accordingly. For the economically weaker OPEC countries, income has declined so much that they are now worried as to how to finance the new round of investment needed in their oil industries. Allowing foreign direct investment in industries is becoming more and more of an alternative option. However, attracting these foreign investments will be more feasible if agreements to limit production are abandoned. The consequence of thus reducing state control over the industry in the member states will further weaken the position of OPEC as a market regulator.","Volume 20, Issue 2",June 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/2,88

The paper conducts a brief overview of macroeconomic developments in Australia during the 1980s, and links these to developments in its terms of trade. A simple deterministic macroeconomic model is then developed and utilized to identify potential macroeconomic changes, through the use of a numerical simulation procedure, arising from terms of trade shocks, which are then compared with actual developments. This procedure suggests that the theoretical framework can shed some important light on the actual macroeconomic adjustments which have arisen.","Volume 20, Issue 2",June 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/2,88
"Sustainable growth models are financial planning tools which weigh financial objectives with operational performance to determine the optimum level of growth for a firm. The gas utility industry is unlike many other industries in that its growth has been dependent on its ability to raise substantial capital in the equity markets. This paper examines the actual and sustainable growth of the US gas utility industry from 1970 to 1990. Each sector of the industry - distribution, transmission, integrated and combination - has different financial objectives and operational performance which has resulted in different rates of growth in revenues. The inefficiency of the pricing system established by the regulation of these sectors was apparent in the declining profit margins in the 1970s and rising asset utilization ratios in the 1980s, both of which adversely affected the sustainable growth rates. Substantial growth potential exists in this industry through future stock issues, operational improvements and changes in financial objectives. Sustainable growth models are shown to be an effective financial planning tool, as well as a tool for directing policies to stimulate growth in this industry.","Volume 20, Issue 2",June 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/2,88

The long established tin exporting industries of South-east Asia, used to earning high mineral rents, have been struggling for survival, while Brazil has emerged as a dominant low cost producer. Sales from Brazil and from China have done much to make ineffective the supply rationalization efforts of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, and a recovery of tin consumption in industrialized and developing countries has been partially counteracted by falls in import demand by Eastern Europe.

"This paper explains why the authors are pessimistic whether a viable futures market will soon appear for electricity in the USA. This pessimism stems from reflection on the characteristics that led to the successful experience of futures markets for natural gas and for crude oil and its derivative products. The critical issue is whether the electricity industry will present the necessary combination of need and opportunity for the operation of organized futures exchanges in the near future. To understand this issue, the authors trace the key changes in petroleum and natural gas market structure that first created robust cash commodity (spot) markets in these industries and then summoned up successful energy futures contracts. This examination reveals critical differences in electricity trade stemming from entrenched state and federal regulatory conventions. These differences suggest that the market for power sales will be unlikely to foster and sustain a viable futures market until significant policy changes are made and executed.","Volume 20, Issue 2",June 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/2,88

"For a long time there has been serious controversy between the multinational oil companies (MOCs) and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), an agency of the government, about the effect of the current government pricing policy (GPP) on the operations of the MOCs. While the MOC executives have contended that the current GPP adversely affects their efficiency, the NNPC has often accused the MOC executives of escalating their operating costs, thereby depriving the country of the maximum benefits from its oil resources. This paper employs a multiperiod goal programming model to determine the impact of the GPP on the operations, efficiency and effectiveness of the MOCs. Among other things, the model results support the claims of both the MOC executives and the NNPC. However, because cost escalation is perceived as induced by the GPP, it is suggested, for effectiveness, that the GPP be reviewed to harmonize the goals of the partners in the joint venture and adequately compensate the foreign partners, in terms of returns on their capital.","Volume 20, Issue 1",March 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/1,89
"The USA is establishing a new royalty on certain minerals on public land. Some persons view the royalty as payment by industry for publicly owned minerals. Others view it as compensation for environmental impacts of mining. Using a model of rent determination with the government as a landowner maximizing social utility, this paper argues for a federal royalty comparable with private sector mineral rent. Data from the private sector suggest that the average rent for gold equates to a 5% (net smelter) royalty. The model also shows that, in a competitive economy, the expected value of marginal exploration must be zero. On the basis of that condition, a comparative static illustration of the effects of a royalty on exploration and consequent discoveries is given. A 5% royalty would reduce the number of gold discoveries on public land to about four-fifths of the number with none, whereas at 12.5%, discoveries would be less than one-third of the number with no royalty.","Volume 20, Issue 1",March 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/1,89

"Achieving sustainable development within Thailand and other developing nations requires a combination of appropriate minerals policies, environmental policies, legislation, administration, enforcement and organization in order to achieve a balance between mineral development and environmental concerns. Central to achieving these objectives is the design and implementation of an efficient and equitable mining reclamation procedure based on the principle of the ‘polluter pays’. It is proposed that a cornerstone of this procedure is a land reclamation bonding process which minimizes the disincentive to invest while maximizing the incentive to protect the environment. A reclamation bond allows the miner (or polluter) to receive a refund of their money for reclamation and thereby is an incentive for the miner to develop a proper plan of operations and reclamation in order to maximize their refundable money - often accomplished by the adoption and utilization of advanced technologies. Between implementing command and control regulations or establishing a bonding system, a bonding system is by far preferable for Thailand and other developing nations on the Asia-Pacific region.","Volume 20, Issue 1",March 1994,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/20/issue/1,89

"Although the question of the further processing of mineral commodities for export in developing countries has often been analysed, few concrete answers have appeared. This study examines the potential impact of further mineral processing activities on industry linkages and growth prospects for copper in Zambia and for phosphates in Morocco. Following an evaluation of the processing argument, a modified static input-output framework is presented, suitable for the analysis of processing activities in developing countries. The empirical results obtained agree well with the theory regarding likely multiplier impacts. This study does not suggest that there is one best processing policy; rather it identifies several processing alternatives that result in substantial economic gains over previous production activities. The results thus suggest that given the right combination of domestic conditions, gains from trade are likely to follow from expanding processing capabilities as well as from improving related processing technologies.","Volume 19, Issue 4",December 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/4,90
"The Chinese steel industry achieved even growth in the 1980s and China is now the world's fourth largest steel producing country. Two factors that have played important roles in this development of the Chinese steel industry are the reform of the system or the strengthening of enterprise autonomy accompanying market reform, and the introduction of advanced technology from Western countries as a continuing policy since the 1970s. The Chinese steel industry still lags far behind those of other steel producing countries in terms of equipment and production technology, however. The present situation and problems of the Chinese steel industry in the 1990s are discussed here, together with a review of its development in the 1980s.","Volume 19, Issue 4",December 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/4,90
"Prospects for the commercialization of deep seabed mining hinge upon projections of future revenues and estimates of costs associated with new technologies. Future revenues will depend upon the behaviour of prices for metals that might be recovered from nodules. In this article, we construct a hypothetical grade and recoverability weighted manganese nodule price from the turn of the century forward and examine its behaviour over time. We consider long-term trends and the potential for cycles in the prices of nodule metals. We employ four techniques to make future predictions about the commercial prospects for deep seabed mining. The most optimistic expected date of commercialization resulting from these predictions is well into the 21st century. Given fixed assumptions about technologies, there are many other reasons for being even more pessimistic about the commercial prospects for deep seabed mining.","Volume 19, Issue 4",December 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/4,90
"Discretionary systems of awarding exploration and production licences, such as that on the UK continental shelf, often use the size of proposed work programmes as an important criterion. This paper models the effect of strategic considerations on the choice of work programme in such licensing systems. The model incorporates uncertainty about resource size and about the work programmes proposed by competing companies. It is found that competition between bidders results in a level of capital investment which exceeds the profit maximizing allocation. It is concluded that licensing systems which emphasize size of work programme can result in strategic but wasteful overcapitalization.","Volume 19, Issue 4",December 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/4,90
"The financial returns to mineral exploration are highly skewed - a few companies find exploration highly profitable, while most find it at best a marginal economic activity. In an attempt to identify those characteristics of the successful few, this paper reviews the literature on managing mineral exploration and on two other business activities characterized by long lead times and uncertain rewards: oil and gas exploration and industrial research and development.","Volume 19, Issue 3",September 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/3,91
"Sustainable development in mining can be achieved only through continuous exploration, technological innovation, and environmental rehabilitation. The exhaustion of known mineral deposits and the accelerated degradation of the environment necessitates the allocation of more resources to exploration, research into applicable technology, and rehabilitation. Increased investment in these activities might cause mineral prices to rise and thus reverse the long-term trend of declining and stagnating mineral prices. Present mineral price structures raise the question whether the environment is adequately priced by the free market. Market imperfections which do not properly reflect the cost to the environment have created exhaustible resources price levels lower than the socially optimal. Mineral producers of the developing world (the South) are unable to sustain mining development in the face of declining mineral price trends. If the inhabitants of the industrialized coutries (the North) are concerned about global environmental degradation, They should be willing to pay mineral prices which internalize environmental costs.","Volume 19, Issue 3",September 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/3,91

"Non-transparency of European natural gas supply costs has understandably led to a fair amount of diversity in computed costs reported in the literature. To provide information on gas costs and the range of uncertainty, we survey these costs. We find a fairly high degree of divergence with a ratio of the average high cost estimate to the average low cost estimate averaging almost 2.44 for gas operating plus development costs for new gas fields, 1.77 for specific long-distance transport links, and 5 for gas distribution costs by country. Costs diverge for a variety of reasons. There is variance depending upon whether costs are measured at the well-head or border, for city gas or at the end user. The level of aggregation varies from field to country to continent. Reported construction costs can vary from ex post to ex ante. Often costs are not available and the researcher must rely on indirect information and personal judgement to ascertain costs. Differing opinions on the appropriate discount rate, currency conversions and the non-homogeneity of gas can all contribute to the computed cost variation. In general computed costs tended to be lower than those collected from the trade literature.","Volume 19, Issue 3",September 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/3,91
"Organizational learning is an emerging paradigm of strategy making. It focuses on continuous productivity improvement and innovation throughout the organization. This paper provides examples of mining companies which are successfully learning. Internal learning is central, and is presented in five phases. Formal collaboration, external shocks, reverse engineering and informal collaboration should each be developed as means of fuelling internal learning. Most mining companies have experienced organizational learning only passively.

"The concept of market efficiency is the foundation for several theoretical constructs in financial economics. This paper tests for market efficiency when information from one market is used to predict prices in a different market. We examine both time-series and multiple regression models and compare the power of each of these models from both a statistical and economic viewpoint. Significant correlations between the gold spot market price and other market variables suggest that market inefficiencies exist. For our particular sample and tests, the time-series model is much superior to the multiple regression model. However, the results also suggest that a transfer function model which is a weighted average of the two models could be an effective forecasting model.","Volume 19, Issue 3",September 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/3,91
"Payment obligation on external debt often creates pressure on export expansion to earn the hard currency required to make debt service payment. This paper finds that debt service obligation is an important determinant of export supply of metals and minerals for some highly indebted Latin American countries. Export supply of metals and minerals from these countries increased during the last two decades, to meet rising debt service payments in the face of deteriorating export prices. This may have implication for metal and mineral consumption in these countries and therefore, for supply and prices in the world market.","Volume 19, Issue 3",September 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/3,91
"The copper industry passed from a collusive behaviour managed by a few companies, to a period lower concentration, which translated into greater competition and rivalry among leading players. This led to trade conflicts between US producers and Codelco in 1978 and 1984. After major cost cuts in the North American industry, conditions are again right for a more cooperative relationship between major players. In this context, Codelco's strategy aims at improving its competitiveness while maintaining and increasing its output level. It also favours stronger collaboration with other players in promotion and joint ventures, which will support a more cooperative long-term development of the industry.","Volume 19, Issue 2",June 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/2,92
"The generation, transmission and distribution of electrical power is essential for the development of an economy. Potential bottlenecks in the electricity sector can have a far reaching impact on overall economic growth. In many developing countries the public sector is the most active agent in the provision of vital energy services. This article examines Pakistan's experience with public sector investment in energy. A model of government budgetary allocations to energy is developed. In applying this model to Pakistan, the paper analyses the impact of fiscal pressures, unanticipated government expenditure, and competing priorities which have constrained the government's investment programme. The main conclusion reached in the paper is that Pakistani authorities must continue to actively encourage private sector power projects. Otherwise, the country is unlikely to be able to sustain its growth given an increasingly severe energy shortage.","Volume 19, Issue 2",June 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/2,92

Results of this study are useful to practitioners and executives of this industry as they have a means of comparing their own corporate performance with the industry average. The purpose of this study is not to predict, but to inform, particularly in the applications of a few financial analytical techniques.

"Large new mineral projects often influence international mineral markets. The Carajás iron ore project in Brazil is a recent example. This paper concludes that production from Carajás depressed the reference price level for iron ore in the late 1980s and thus brought about both permanent changes to that commodity market structure and revenue losses to other iron ore producers. For this reason, the international effects of large projects should be taken into account by project planners during project appraisal.","Volume 19, Issue 2",June 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/2,92
"The mineral aggregate market of the Eastern USA is quantitatively modelled and the interaction of its components measured. Systematic study of supply, demand, price and transport characteristics of aggregate identified relevant modelling parameters and generated corresponding submodels. The supply model is based on production data segmented by labour inputs. Demand estimates overall consumption on the basis of per capita output and interest rates. Price depends mainly on geological availability and on market size, size of operation and average annual per capita income. Distribution is the least cost way of balancing production and consumption, given the constraints imposed by transport costs. The model developed is used to simulate different situations with its outputs illustrating its versatility and possibilities. The examples presented concern the price isoquants for coarse aggregate in 1987, price increase isoquants for 1987-92, the impact of foreign sources of aggregate and sensitivity to changes in transport costs.","Volume 19, Issue 2",June 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/2,92
"This article develops a simple cross- section model of steel intensity of use in the less developed countries, based on the presumption that the inverted U-shaped intensity of use curve is shifting downward over time as a result of steel saving new technology, material substitution, and other time related factors. The results suggest that growth in real per capita income of about 1% a year is required for the shift in consumer preferences toward more steel intensive products to offset the downward trend over time in steel intensity of use. The results also indicate that about half of the variation among countries in the growth of metal intensity of use is driven by determinants not closely associated with either per capita income or time, variables whose influence on metal intensity of use is still poorly understood.","Volume 19, Issue 2",June 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/2,92
By the year 2000 most world mining production will be controlled by private enterprises with only a small proportion of output coming from state-owned mining properties. Consumption of minerals will continue to grow but the rate of increase will be greater in the developing countries than in the industrialized nations. In the near future problems of adjusting to market economy will tend to limit consumption gains in the former centrally planned countries. Ample reserves of most major minerals will indicate that there should be adequate production available to meet worldwide demand.,"Volume 19, Issue 1",March 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/1,93
"Sustainable development requires that consumption by present generations should not be at the expense of future generations. For mineral economies this means substituting an alternative income source for the depleting mineral asset and curbing environmental degradation. But Dutch disease (the negative symbiosis between the mining and other tradable sectors which mutes both the rate and efficiency of economic growth) can subvert both sustainability goals. First, Dutch disease weakens the non-mining tradables sector so that it cannot propel the economy should mining be marginalized. Second, Dutch disease retards economic growth so that investment in environmental management and clean technology is slow and environmental damage is the greater. Sustainable development must therefore overcome Dutch disease and this requires a pragmatic orthodox macroeconomic policy. the latter mutes the damaging impact of fluctuating ore revenues and spurs competitive diversification and economic growth so that new investment and the rapid adoption of environmentally sensitive technology is facilitated.","Volume 19, Issue 1",March 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/1,93
"This paper contributes to the debate over the extent to which changes in exchange rates are passed through to changes in import prices. A model of imperfect competition is presented and is used to estimate the impact of changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate and other factors on US and Japanese steel prices. A 10% change in the yen/dollar exchange rate is estimated to result in a 7.3% change in the prices of Japanese steel imported into the USA but to only a 1.9% change in US producer proces for steel. The small share of the Japanese imports in the US steel market can provide an explanation for that latter result. Both US and Japanese steel prices are influenced significantly by industrial activity in the USA as represented by the US index of industrial production, while US steel prices are also seen to be affected by changes in the costs of production.","Volume 19, Issue 1",March 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/1,93
"Despite the popular view that state mineral enterprises are less flexible than private mining firms in adjusting output to changes in market conditions, almost all of the empirical studies undertaken to substantiate this contention have failed. Adopting an alternative empirical approach, this paper finds that, in contrast to the results of earlier empirical efforts, state ownership fundamentally modifies supply behaviour. Not only are state copper firms less price responsive than their private counterparts, they actually appear to behave perversely at least at relatively low prices. It is also found that governments use the firms under their control as a macroeconomic tool to adjust balance of payments. The paper argues that the identified pattern of state enterprise behaviour accentuates market cycles and volatility in the copper industry.","Volume 19, Issue 1",March 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/1,93
"Managerial flexibility adds value to a project, but this gain is seldom considered, because traditional evaluation methods cannot measure it. Operating flexibility, for example to save costs taking advantage of price developments, operates as an option. Contingent claims analysis, a technique based on financial option theory, takes advantage of the option-like behaviour of managerial flexibility to estimate its value. We apply this technique to a copper project comprising mining, leaching and electrowinning processes, which shows the flexibility to modify the cut off grade strategy each time copper prices change unexpectedly, following an intertemporal cut off grade optimizing model.","Volume 19, Issue 1",March 1993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/19/issue/1,93

"The strong influence of resource endowments, the depleting nature of ore extraction, and relative costs on patterns of location of mineral production are illustrated by reference to copper. Determined managerial action can offset seemingly immutable trends in competitiveness as the experience of the US copper industry in the 1980s demonstrates. Changes in the nature and pattern of demand are perhaps less obvious but important factors, again illustrated by copper. Evolving shares of world production of six other minerals are described to demonstrate other determinants of location.

Through various examples taken from African and post-socialist countries, it compares the ways in which production and social activities are handled at the micro level by capitalist, socialist and rent earning states. As the capitalist state appears today to be the only form of state able to organize production and welfare separately, the paper examines the conditions under which such a separation could occur in mining and metallurgical operations in non-capitalist countries.","Volume 18, Issue 4",December 1992,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/18/issue/4,94

"LKAB was severely hit by the emergence of an extraordinary oversupply of iron ore, following the two oil crises in the 1970s. LKAB's products became uncompetitive, both on cost and on quality grounds, and the volume of deliveries was sharply curtailed.

This was particularly true for pellet products, whose share in total deliveries has risen from one-third to two- thirds in the past 20 years. The product development efforts, along with strong measures to reduce unit costs, have turned the former losses into stable profits.

"The special contribution of land and natural resources to production and the distribution of wealth has been a prominent theme in two centuries of economic doctrine. Economic thinkers since Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus have argued that the limited supply of land and resources will constrain economic growth, and this idea recurs in modern writing about the environment and the economy. History has not confirmed these predictions about inevitable scarcities and their limits to growth. On the contrary, the output of food and primary resource materials has continued to grow and their relative prices, far from rising, have declined. The limits of nature's endowment have been overcome by advancing technology which has increased supplies, broadened the range of substitute materials and reduced requirements for particular purposes. These continuing trends have important implications for economic policies of resource rich regions and countries.","Volume 18, Issue 3",September 1992,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/18/issue/3,95

"The sheer scale of the North-West Shelf Natural Gas Project inevitably entails substantial consequences for the Australian and West Australian economies. In this paper an applied general equilibrium model is used to estimate the size of these effects. Expenditure during the construction phase stimulates the industries that supply the investment goods. This higher demand, however, is inflationary and so reduces the competitiveness of export and import competing industries. The net result is that the project does not have much impact on simulated real GDP during the construction phase. The production phase entails major increases in exports, in the output of industries supplying inputs to the project, and in real national income. However, the export surge causes the real exchange rate to appreciate, leading to deteriorating conditions in other internationally trading industries. Nevertheless, the upshot is an improvement in the balance of trade and an increase in real GDP of about 1% during a typical year of the production phase.","Volume 18, Issue 3",September 1992,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/18/issue/3,95
"Following the closure of the Black Angel lead-zinc mine in Greenland and as a result of problems in the fishing industry, the possibility of developing the assumed mineral wealth of the country has gained renewed interest. This interest has been expressed through the efforts made to create an attractive regulatory framework for exploration and mining investment. A new mining act for Greenland and new tax legislation applicable only to mineral projects was enacted in spring 1991. The next step is exploration, primarily by foreign investors, followed by development and mining of new discoveries. Assuming that discoveries of mineable deposits are made and developed, mineral revenues will accrue to Greenland.

The results show that a few techniques are widely utilized in this industry but that the techniques used most frequently are not as sophisticated as reported in previous, more broadly based surveys.

"The material composition of product is defined as the quantity of a material used in the production of one unit of a product during a year. This ratio is computed by dividing the quantity of goods produced duting that year, and has shown steady declines over time for many metals. These declining trends could be the result of several interrelated effects: the substitution of other materials, continued improvements in product design, and improvements in manufacturing technology. This paper demonstrates that these effects can be classified into two categories. First, existing products and manufacturing processes can be improved and made more material efficient. This is a short-run adjustment bucause no major changes are made to capital equipment. This adjustment process can be modelled by the use of learning curves. The second category of changes that allow adjustments in materials manufacturing plant redesign. This requires major capital investment to re-tool the manufacturing process and is therefore a long-run adjustment that can be characterizedby models of the diffusion of new tehnology. These two aspects (short-run learning curves and lon-run trends in the diffusion of technology) are demonstrated for the case of the materials used in manufacturing beer containers in the USA.","Volume 18, Issue 2",June 1992,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/18/issue/2,96

"The paper analyses the demise of Bolivia as a tin mining economy. It describes the contradiction between the state requiring COMIBOL, the public mining company, to maximize employment, production and surplus extraction at the national level, at the expense of developing an efficient corporate strategy at the firm level. A case study of the mining operation Colquiri illustrates in microcosm how the state evolved an autonomous bureaucrary – COMIBOL - which was encouraged to maximize production at the expense of the costs of doing so, regardless of the downward spiralling of metal prices and global stockpiling of tin. Central to the argument is the development of the concept of a modo de ser of COMIBOL or a pattern of corporate behaviour. The technological, social and organizational dynamics of COMIBOL'S behaviour are analysed in the context of changing national political environments and international market pressures, culminating in the crash of the tin market in 1985. Finally, the paper builds on this analysis to draw out implications for the future development of Bolivia's mining industry, since the country still possesses considerable mineral resources – in gold, silver and zinc as well as tin, and underutilized expertise. Policy options are discussed which include newly announced proposals for joint ventures with foreign mining companies.","Volume 18, Issue 1",March 1992,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/18/issue/1,97

"Most metal stocks held by fabricators and other users go unreported, and consequently variations in these stocks are recorded as changes in metal consumption. This article, using copper as an example, proposes a methodology for quantifying movements in these invisible inventories and thereby for improving the available data on copper consumption. It contends that the true level of copper consumption is largely determined by industrial production, and as a result the error term for a regression of reported copper consumption or industrial production and other relevant variables can provide an approximation of invisible stock movements. The results, though tentative, indicate that invisible stocks move procyclically with expansions and contractions amounting to 10–15% of annual consumption over the business cycle. This suggests that actual copper consumption varies less over the business cycle than indicated by the reported data, and that short-run price elasticities of demand estimated on the basis or reported copper consumption are probably biased toward zero. Estimated changes in invisible inventories also help explain why copper prices rose in 1987, rather than two to three years earlier as was widely expected on the basis of reported inventory movements, and why the rise in price persisted for several years.","Volume 18, Issue 1",March 1992,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/18/issue/1,97

"Recent studies on the association between geology and mineral resources using an input-process-output model have found that there is a linear relationship between geological diversity (x) and mineral commodity diversity (y) based on a standard regression equation which can be used to predict the expected number of mineral commodities in a region. A study for India shows that it has a poor linear relationship between geological diversity and mineral commodity diversity, the regression equation showing a poor R2 of only 0.31 even after excluding three states with very low mineral diversity. The points for the Indian states plotted on a standard scatter diagram for the states of the USA, for four provinces of South Africa, for Zimbabwe and for New Zealand fall well below the 95% confidence limit of the regression line, indicating a fair likelihood of undiscovered mineral commodities in India.","Volume 18, Issue 1",March 1992,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/18/issue/1,97
"Following the first oil crisis world crude steel consumption stagnated. Most explanations of this trend change have focused on reduction in economic growth rates, changing product composition of income and reduction in the metal content of products. Some analysts have concluded that steel is in decline, although there is evidence of continuing vigour in the industry. Perhaps crude steel consumption trends are misleading and hence a new consumption series based on effective strength is proposed. This requires the estimation of a number of technological factors which by chance began to have a significant effect about the same time as the first oil crisis. Most of these factors are now approaching practical limits and hence crude steel consumption is likely to resume an upward trend during this decade.","Volume 17, Issue 4",December 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/4,98
"This paper uses simulations of a model of a company's decision about the maximum bid value and the optimal investment programme for a resource tract to compare the auction and discretionary systems of licence allocation. The modle includes uncertainty about the size of resource stock and the selling price of extracted resource, as well as risk aversion on the part of the company. It is concluded that an auction system provides the government both with better information about a company's perception of the value of a resource tract and with the potential for considerably higher revenue from its licensing.","Volume 17, Issue 4",December 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/4,98
"Technological development affects long-term production costs for mineral producers in both developing and industrialized countries. The driving forces for technological change during the 1980s have primarily been escalation of costs and rising environmental concerns. After a period of slow technological innovation in the mining and metallurgical industry during the last decade there are signs that the speed of change will increase during the 1990s. A new type of mining transnational company, combining traditional international mining experience with extensive R and D efforts and proprietary mining technology will emerge. Technological barriers to developing countries will increase and diminish their competitiveness.","Volume 17, Issue 4",December 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/4,98
"Australia is a sparsely populated country that is well endowed with energy resources, and the size of coal, natural gas, and uranium reserves relative to domestic demand has given Australia the opportunity to become a major exporter of these fuels. This paper assesses Australian supply potential of these three fuels, together with crude oil, through to the early years of the next century. With the exception of crude oil, supply potential appears adequate to meet projected domestic and export demand. However, crude oil supplies are unlikely to meet domestic requirements, and to the shortfall may be considerable.","Volume 17, Issue 4",December 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/4,98
Several public agencies have expressed interest in increasing the quantity and improving the quality of information they provide on advanced materials. This paper discusses specific information and analysis needs by focusing on potential differences between traditional and advanced materials. Also discussed are the various ways advanced materials can be defined and classified and the importance of different classification schemes to different types of analyses. Twelve potential differences between advanced and traditional materials are discussed. Potential differences range from varying physical and chemical properties to the range of expertise required for materials development and manufacture. Numerous information and analysis needs are derived from the discussion of these differences. The paper argues that identifying information needs for advanced materials requires a fundamental rethinking of why information of various types is important.,"Volume 17, Issue 4",December 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/4,98
"In this paper we estimate a flexible form cost function of the aluminium industry in the USA and use our estimates to obtain derived demand curves for aluminium inputs such as electricity and bauxite. We then calculate the welfare gains arising from decreased energy use when the level of secondary recycling is increased. The process is repeated for several model specifications. All of our tests, however, yield similar results and indicate that substitution of scrap for only 5% of the bauxite presently used in US aluminium manufacturing would result in annual savings of close to a quarter of a billion dollars.","Volume 17, Issue 4",December 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/4,98
"Zambia, like other copper producers, took the high late 1960s copper price as the norm and regarded the mid-1970s mineral price fall as an aberration. It adjusted by foreign borrowing rather than by structural change. Consequently, when the early 1980s price shock drove copper revenues even lower, Zambia had little room for manoeuvre. The cumulative scale of the required adjustment then impeded IMF-backed reforms and further delayed the diversification into farming, agroindustry and labour intensive manufactures which the country's shrinking copper ‘bonus’ dictates.","Volume 17, Issue 3",September 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/3,99
"Notwithstanding similarities in their origin and recovery, metals and industrial minerals display significant differences in their economic behaviour. While an empirical investigation of a range of metals and industrial minerals provides little evidence of systematic differences in demand patterns, it provides clear evidence of lower price volatility in industrial minerals. The reasons for this latter difference are examined and found to lie in the more highly differentiated nature of industrial minerals, in market segmentation, in differences in industry and cost structures, and in the existence of a less developed stocks function in industrial minerals' markets. An implication is that, in contrast to metals projects where price is generally the critical variable, industrial minerals projects tend to be more sensitive to volume considerations.","Volume 17, Issue 3",September 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/3,99
"Chinese steel demand will grow from 60 million tons in the late 1980s to 100 million tons by the year 2000. The Chinese steel market will then rank equal with markets in Japan, the USA and the European Community. Chinese steel demand is predicted to stay below the level of 1988 until 1992. After a strong recovery in 1992-93, steel demand will then grow at 5% per annum in the second half of the 1990s. These forecasts are generated by a vector autoregressive model of the Chinese economy.

"The European non-ferrous metals industry is traditionally important by world standards, and it is the home of big international companies. However, in the second half of the 1970s financial problems forced the industry to restructure. Positioned at the upper end of the production cost curve, European smelters are extremely vulnerable to downturns in demand, changes in exchange rates, difficulties in the supply of ores, increases in the price of inputs, namely energy, and new environmental regulations. Long-term survival is possible only if existing firms are industrial leaders in cost competitiveness, technical innovation, aggressive promotion of new products and several other areas. As many companies are not in this position, a second wave of restructuring is now under way in Europe. This article presents ten conditions for the survival of European smelters into the 21st century.","Volume 17, Issue 3",September 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/3,99
"The copper industry appears to have regained the dynamic equilibrium between the capability to supply and demand which it lost during the long price recession of the 1980s. Capacity rose substantially in the 1970s but stagnated for most of the 1980s, when there was prolonged excess capacity. Small shifts in the total disguise considerable turbulence, with substantial annual changes in openings and closings. Expansions and reductions at existing mines are very important. There is an inbuilt tendency for the erosion of capacity so that replacements are needed even when demand stagnates. Much investment only changes capacity as a byproduct of other motivations. Metal prices alone are less important than the net returns to the mines in influencing investment. Long lead times, however, mask any directly observable relationship between present profitability and investment in new capacity.","Volume 17, Issue 3",September 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/3,99
"A spatial equilibrium model depicting world iron ore trade is presented. It employs a quadratic program to evaluate the market performance of the iron ore industry in 1984 and predicts trade flows and market clearing prices for year 2000 assuming perfect competition under expansionist and stagnant demand scenarios. Market imperfections are found to distort some 21% of allocations and delivered prices, but the welfare costs are borne by producers in rents forgone and transport costs absorbed. Under perfect competition all producing regions benefit, but predicted shifts in market demand benefit the market shares of Africa and South America at the expense of Australia.","Volume 17, Issue 3",September 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/3,99
"Prices and consumption of the major metals are unstable and, moreover, cyclical because of the regularity of instability caused by the strong link between fluctuations in the overall level of economic activity and metal demand. This paper reviews the causes and historical patterns of cyclical instability and compares major metals with gold, energy fuels, industrial minerals, primary commodities and manufactured goods. It finds that metal prices have been more unstable than consumption; that metal prices and consumption were more unstable in the 1970s than in either the 1960s or 1980s; that the synchronization from metal to metal in price and consumption patterns broke down during the 1980s; that many industrial minerals are cyclical too; and that prices for metals as a group are no more unstable than those of other primary commodities.","Volume 17, Issue 2",June 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/2,100
"Conventional practice in managing metal price cycles is to focus on minimizing production costs so that the operation can survive periods of very low market price. In practice, companies particularly stress operating cost reduction. A better approach is to recognize that the structure of costs is as important as their level and, in particular, the costs that need to be minimized are those that have to be paid at all times ie the fixed costs. The paper suggests that greater attention to creating variability in capital cost obligations, avoiding the quasifixed element in operating costs, and sharing market risk with suppliers and customers have the potential to ameliorate the worst effects of cyclical instability in prices.","Volume 17, Issue 2",June 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/2,100
"A cyclical price environment introduces risks, but also opportunities, that require careful managerial attention and planning. A primary tool in dealing with the economic implications of metal price cyclicality is proper project valuation. Conventional approaches to project valuation are well known and include various derivatives of the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. These methods break down, however, when applied to actively managed investments. The flexibility of managerial response to external developments, including price fluctuations, is not considered in the DCF methodology. The capital asset pricing model and the arbitrage pricing theory have been developed to address the valuation of investments subject to various forms of business risk; but they suffer from limitations herein discussed. A new approach based on option pricing theory is being developed which offers promise. However, the approach is not as yet sufficiently developed to provide a practical substitute for the DCF methods.","Volume 17, Issue 2",June 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/2,100
"The evolution of the capital markets and the concept of financial engineering over the past decade has been striking. The participation of investors and financial intermediaries in commodity as well as the financial markets provides a wide range of tools for the mining industry. Financial policy and techniques can be used to achieve competitive and strategic ends, and to manage financial and business risks. Rather than being limited by the cyclical, risky nature of the mining industry, finance actually provides alternatives for coping with cyclicality and risk.","Volume 17, Issue 2",June 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/2,100
"The paper examines the various fiscal instruments used in mining taxation in a range of developed and developing countries to evaluate whether they are designed to meet the business cycle of metal markets. Government goals are wider than those of mining companies, covering not only issues relating to efficiency and revenue but also areas of distribution and the environment. Hence cyclicality is not the overriding determinant of a fiscal regime. Nevertheless, the are some elements — generous capital allowances and the principle of setting off profit losses against future profits — that can mitigate the effects of a downturn. The author recommends a hybrid regime incorporating these elements in a corporate tax structure in a regime that also encompasses an ad valorem royality, and an additional profits tax which should satisfy both government and investor objectives.","Volume 17, Issue 2",June 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/2,100

The statistical analysis suggests that the ‘commoditization’ of aluminum ingot has taken place, although not to the extent found in the copper industry. In spite of the fact that ingot comprises about 70% of the cost of producing mill products, at the semi- fabricating stage the firms are still in a position to insulate the prices of their mill products from the volatility that has affected ingot prices.","Volume 17, Issue 1",March 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/1,101

Using aggregate data for the period 1960–1961 to 1982–1983 we discover that the factor combinations have been cost minimizing. Estimation of a generalized cost function reveals that (1) production is characterized by increasing returns to scale; (2) technical progress has, over time, increased the use of some factors and reduced that of others, all else remaining the same; and (3) there exist considerable opportunity for substitution between factors. Several policy conclusions emerge: in particular, the inappropriateness of visualizing a fixed relation between additions to capacity and additional output.","Volume 17, Issue 1",March 1991,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/17/issue/1,101

After nearly seven decades of domination over Mongolia, the USSR is now disengaging itself politically and militarily from the landlocked Asian nation and substantially reducing its financial and technical assistance. A majority of Soviet assistance has been directed to Mongolia's mining industry, which accounts for nearly one-fifth of Mongolia's gross national product and about half of its export earnings. With the decreased levels of assistance from the USSR and Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) countries, new opportunities for lending and joint mineral ventures involving non-Soviet bloc nations may arise.

"Papua New Guinea has, until most recently, shown all the signs of a newly independent developing economy on the move. However, since November 1988 the nation has been overshadowed by the most serious national crisis since independence in 1975.

The copper mine has closed; the island is under the control of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army; the national government has lost royalties from a mine which has provided 44% of its exports and 16% of its gross domestic product since 1972; and over a hundred Papua New Guineans have lost their lives in battle.

The spot prices of lead, tin and zinc over the period January 1964 to December 1987 have served as the basis of the analysis. The results show that spot prices for lead and both tin and zinc are cointegrated at the 1% level. This means that these markets are not efficient in the semistrong form sense since casuality must run in at least one direction. There is also evidence of a weaker (in a statistical sense) cointegrating relationship between the spot prices for tin and zinc.","Volume 16, Issue 4",December 1990,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/16/issue/4,102

The analytical framework is provided by the financial theory of risk. Managements must deal with both company specific risk and market risk as they attempt to improve the profitability of their companies.

"Since the 1960s the Japanese government has encouraged Japanese firms to invest in overseas production and primary processing of minerals and energy, in order to enhance Japan's access to raw materials. This investment peaked in the early 1970s and remained relatively high until the early 1980s, when it dropped. This policy and reduced investment had their effects, as the share of imports from direct investment based sources in Japan's total imports rose significantly for copper, aluminium, iron ore and coking coal by the mid-1970s. However, this share has declined since the early 1980s (liquefied gas and oil were exceptions) as overall imports of these commodities increased and Japanese investors found more attractive alternatives. In the case of oil, the share remained low, around 10%, throughout the entire period.","Volume 16, Issue 4",December 1990,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/16/issue/4,102

"A model for domestic Australian steel consumption based on the intensity of use technique is developed and estimated. This model relates steel intensity of use to intrasectoral and intersectoral shifts as well as technological change and relative steel prices. The results indicate that steel intensity of use has declined because of the combination of a significant relative decline in the construction and manufacturing sectors, a slight relative contraction in the traditional manufacturing sector, an upward trend in steel prices and the influence of material saving technological change.","Volume 16, Issue 3",September 1990,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/16/issue/3,103

This range of consumption conforms closely to that produced by an extensive translog consumption model which includes GDP, price of aluminium and its chief substitute, copper, and time as a proxy for technical change in aluminium using products and product technology. Analysis of various models by ex post forecast errors on a test period showed the most accurate models to be a simple learning model for cumulative IU and a time varying coefficient consumption model, followed by the extensive translog consumption model.

"The greatest potential for metal demand growth is widely thought to lie with the less developed countries where in contrast to the more developed countries intensity of metal use is expected to rise over time. The historical record, however, is mixed, with some LDCs experiencing rising and others declining intensities of use. This analysis of steel use in Korea suggests that the intensity of metal use is likely to rise in those LDCs where per capita income is growing rapidly, for in such countries the shift in domestic preferences toward metal intensive goods will normally more than offset the tendency for material substitution and resource saving technology to reduce the intensity of metal use. Conversely, intensity of metal use is likely to fall in LDCs where per capita income is stagnant or growing slowly. These findings suggest future growth in LDC metal demand will be largely concentrated in those countries experiencing rapid economic development.","Volume 16, Issue 3",September 1990,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/16/issue/3,103
"The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is generally regarded as the most promising region for onshore oil exploration in the USA. Congress is currently debating whether to allow the Department of Interior (DOI) to sell leases for oil exploration and development in this environmentally unique region. In 1987 DOI released a study of the oil potential and environmental vulnerability of the ANWR which recommended unlimited leasing. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) subsequently responded with its own, conflicting assessment of the potential of the region. The DOI and EIA estimates of oil potential differ by a factor of five. This paper presents an analysis and critique of these studies. A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to generate comparable projections of oil production using DOI and EIA data and assumptions. This model makes it possible to reconcile the previous results and to study the sensitivity of the projections to key assumptions.

"Despite frequent references to myopia in the literatures of economics and the social sciences more generally, little consideration has been given to the possibility of a converse form of misperception, hypermetropia, and to the formulation of empirical tests for myopia and hypermetropia vis-à-vis emmetropia (‘correct’ relative weighting of the present and future). The focus of this analysis is on the identification of myopia/hypermetropia in markets for exhaustible resources. Surprisingly, the study finds suggestive evidence that hypermetropia may be more pervasive than myopia in primary resource markets ie that present and future welfare could be enhanced through increased present utilization of resources together with increases in investment, simply because the rate of return to capital (as reflected in interest rates) appears to be greater than rates of return to resources transferred from the present to the future (as reflected in the rate of increase of resource prices).","Volume 16, Issue 2",June 1990,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/16/issue/2,104
"Although China has a large volume of iron ore deposits the grade of iron ore is very low. This has led to unfavourable conditions for developing China's iron and steel industry. In particular the big steel plants in East China have faced severe shortages of iron ore. China is a large developing country and the demand for finished steel is increasing rapidly. Consumption growth of finished steel cannot depend entirely on increased imports of steel. China will therefore develop its local iron and steel industry vigorously. In the coming ten years China's resource policy for iron ore is for the greater part to depend on domestic mining, but there will also be a step by step expansion of imports.

This study examines the role played by material prices on the use and substitution of materials in windows, utilizing data and information obtained from a survey of UK industry. The relationship between material prices and material use and substitution is found to be complex and not necessarily negative. Furthermore, material prices appear to be of secondary importance as compared to the significance of the intrinsic characteristics possessed by respective materials and the resulting qualitative differences that exist across windows. Legislative considerations may become a more significant influence on material substitution as international concern over the environment increases.","Volume 16, Issue 2",June 1990,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/16/issue/2,104

"Although Australia has the Western world's largest economic reserves of uranium, it is only the fifth largest producing nation and its uranium potential is largely unrealized. At the root of this situation are the interventionist attitudes and policies of successive federal governments which for more than four decades have distorted the investment decision and, in more recent times, discouraged investment. Initially, uranium policy was determined by its strategic value and Australia's commitment to the nuclear deterrence philosophy. Later on, in a complete reversal, the morality of Australia's participation in the nuclear fuel cycle has been intensely debated. The end result has been a misallocation of resources and an uncertain outlook for the industry. If the past is a guide to the future, Australia may not develop its full uranium potential before the end of the century, if ever.","Volume 16, Issue 1",March 1990,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/16/issue/1,105

"Despite being the world's largest consumer of non-fuel minerals the EEC does not have a common minerals policy. The EEC's position is assessed and compared with those of the USA and Japan. Moves towards the establishment of a minerals policy, which have been reinforced by changes in the composition of the EEC and by the approach of the single market in 1993, are traced from the mid-1970s, concluding with a description of a major new initiative launched in 1989.","Volume 16, Issue 1",March 1990,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/16/issue/1,105
"The relationship between the discount rate and the rate of resource extraction is central to the economics of depletion. Neher and Farzin have shown this relationship to be of ambiguous sign for capital intensive minerals because a higher discount rate, while lowering the value of the resource stock and thus encouraging extraction, also increases the capital cost of that extraction. This paper employs a simulation analysis to assess the relative importance of these anticonservation and disinvestment effects for the important copper and bituminous coal industries. At the actual estimated discount rates for these minerals we find that the two effects approximately balance, leaving extraction approximately neutral with respect to the rate of discount. This in turn negates the common presumption of underconservation by mineral firms with discount rates exceeding the social rate of discount.","Volume 16, Issue 1",March 1990,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/16/issue/1,105
"This paper develops a general model that can be used to explain past trends in metal consumption and to make long-term forecasts of metal requirements. The model identifies four apparent determinants of consumption that are explained by underlying economic trends. This framework is applied to the case of US steel consumption over the 1963-83 period and the model explains 73% of the variation in consumption over that period. The underlying economic variables are then projected into the future to yield forecasts to the year 2010, indicating slow growth in the use of steel in the USA.","Volume 16, Issue 1",March 1990,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/16/issue/1,105
Recent legislation mandates an increased role for public participation in natural resource policy making. This paper presents an operational way to provide those impacted with relevant information and to enable public officials to assess public reaction to proposed policies. The methodology transforms results obtained from a multisector model of income formation and distribution into positive economic measures of distributional impacts. The usefulness of the methodology is illustrated in the context of a policy to increase coal surface mining on public lands.,"Volume 15, Issue 4",December 1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/15/issue/4,106

Discounting future benefits of depletable resources has also been regarded as incompatible with sustainable economic growth.

"Energy ‘policy’ is not a recent invention. What is new is that instead of a variety of policies rooted for the most part in notions other than adequacy of reasonably priced and readily available energy supplies, the past fifteen years or so have witnessed the emergence of a set of policies that are more pointedly directed at energy targets as such. These include, above all, such cross cutting issues as efficiency in use, security against supply disruptions, incentives to oil and gas producers, opportunities for the development of alternative energy sources and concern for the equitable sharing of costs associated with any of these policies. If there is one overriding issue that permeates the policy fabric it is the delineation of the governmental role versus market forces.

"This paper is a study of the response by the US copper companies to the changing market conditions of the period 1970–1988. The analysis of past and current behaviour is based on the long-run strategies that the copper industry must use to adjust to periodical cyclical volatility instead of a one time reaction to a particular structural change in the market. This need to adjust to cyclical volatility, whatever the cause, is the reason behind observed behaviour strategies. Changes in mine ownership and operation are detailed, and case studies of AMAX, Anaconda, ASARCO, Cyprus, Duval, Kennecott, Newmont, and Phelps Dodge are discussed. The results show that the primary change in the dominant behavioural strategy of the industry is a movement to cost efficient, copper specializing companies at the expense of the more broadly based mineral companies.","Volume 15, Issue 4",December 1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/15/issue/4,106

The distinguishing features characterizing each of the metals are brought out. The factors analysed include: the central role of South Africa and the USSR in the mine supply of gold and platinum; the overwhelming importance of the photography industry and catalytic automobile converters in the demand for silver and platinum; and the use of precious metals for investment and hoarding. In the case of gold, the inventory owners wield a far greater influence than any other factors that affect that market.","Volume 15, Issue 3",September 1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/15/issue/3,107
"In the last decade increased price volatility has created problems for producers and consumers of non-ferrous metals. This paper examines the causes and consequences of price instability. Particular attention is given to the changing roles of the two major institutions for determining metal prices — the North American producer pricing system and the metal exchanges, principally the London Metal Exchange (LME). Producer prices are set by the major North American firms in the industry, whereas exchange or terminal prices are determined in competitive auction markets. The paper attempts to explain why the traditional producer pricing system has weakened. The consequences of increased reliance on metal exchanges are examined and recent changes in the organization of the LME are assessed.","Volume 15, Issue 3",September 1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/15/issue/3,107

Renewed efforts to promote economic cooperation with Asia suggest a favourable environment for trade expansion. The various forms of minerals cooperation between the USSR and Asian countries are reviewed. Despite some concerns about decreasing minerals self sufficiency, changing trade patterns suggest continued vigour in the Soviet minerals sector. Given the revived Soviet emphasis on foreign trade and cooperation, interaction between Soviet-Asian mineral industries is expected to grow.

We offer instead the concept of transmaterialization, which furnishes a longer-run or more complete interpretation of materials demand patterns.

"Optimal depletion of exhaustible resources has become part of resource economics textbooks. In this paper the author explores the possible policy relevance of some simple abstract models. It is shown that optimal depletion of an exhaustible resource of constant cost and a hyperbolic demand curve is compatible with Marchetti's logistic substitution model. Optimal depletion trajectories for an exhaustible resource which has a linear demand curve, for which cost increases linearly with cumulated use, are described by the analogue of a damped oscillator. Combining this model with resource supply curves as derived from the crustal abundance geostatistical model provides a tool to relate the resource economic notions of maximizing social welfare, price elasticity of demand and resource base estimates for a given set of planning parameters.","Volume 15, Issue 3",September 1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/15/issue/3,107
"The issue of access to public lands for mineral exploration is much more controversial in the USA than in Canada because the USA has more competing uses for its public lands. Current US policies governing exploration on public lands need major overhaul including, most importantly, significant revision of the Mining Law of 1872. In Canada, on the other hand, incremental reforms of existing policies seem to be more appropriate. There is little to suggest that restrictive land-use policies have contributed significantly to recent problems of international competitiveness in the mining industries of either the USA or Canada.","Volume 15, Issue 2",June 1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/15/issue/2,108

"International financial institutions, particularly the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, provide significant financial assistance to mining projects in developing countries. The primary purpose of the loans is to promote economic development but there may be important, perhaps unintended, consequences of this assistance. This paper examines the extent to which lending from international financial institutions tends to (1) subsidize mineral producers in certain developing countries; (2) promote expansion increases and in turn contribute to oversupply of some minerals; (3) serve as a catalyst for lending from private institutions that may not have loaned money to a project in the absence of participation by the international organizations; and (4) encourage refinancing of existing debt without requiring bad loans to be written off.","Volume 15, Issue 2",June 1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/15/issue/2,108
"The decline of the dollar since February 1985 relative to countries of the industrialized world is a generally welcome development, acting to restore lost competitive advantages to US industry. However, as this paper shows, use of popular exchange rate indices can be a misleading indicator of shifting competitive advantage. The copper industry serves as an interesting illustration. Real exchange rates have not improved for the USA compared to several important copper producing nations, including Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Zaire and Zambia. As this paper shows, region- or even country-specific analysis of real exchange rate movements is necessary to assess supply side factors.","Volume 15, Issue 2",June 1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/15/issue/2,108
"From the mid-1970s until very recently, steel producers have been in the grip of a severe crisis of excess capacity. Recent improvements in profitability have been due to cyclical increases in demand, particularly in Europe, and to significant capacity reductions, particularly in the USA. Nevertheless, the underlying problems persist and are likely to lead to further restricting pressures as the cycle shifts and as new entrants, using new steel technologies or new materials, capture market share. This article, written in late 1986, describes the causes of the crisis and the varying responses to it, particularly in the USA and Europe. In the USA, trade restraints have shifted the burden of adjustment to consumers, while in most European countries taxpayers have subsidized major losses. The paper argues for a separation of economic policy, which should focus on restructuring and efficiency, from social policy, which should address the costs of adjustment.","Volume 15, Issue 2",June 1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/15/issue/2,108

State ownership in the non-socialist world mineral industries grew from insignificance in the 1950s to account for about one-third of total production capacity in the early 1980s. The motivations for this growth are explored. It is concluded that the period of expansion has now come to an end. The characteristic features and behavioural patterns of state owned enterprises are described. The implications of a large and increasingly mature state owned universe for international mineral markets and for the privately owned industry are analysed. The analyses point to the painful disruptions to which many multinational firms were subjected by the successive waves of nationalization in the 1960s and 1970s. But they also indicate that there is little foundation for the frequent claims that state owned firms constitute a survival threat to the private industry.,"Volume 15, Issue 1",March 1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/15/issue/1,109

This paper begins with a brief review of some of the adverse effects associated with metals, mining and processing. The legal framework by which governmental controls have been imposed in the USA is then presented. The Canadian approach is also summarized, as are examples from several other countries. Available information concerning the costs of these US regulations is then given. Finally, there is a discussion of the effect of these government mandated costs on the competitiveness of US metals production. A major conclusion is that these costs have impaired competitiveness but probably less significantly than other factors.","Volume 15, Issue 1",March 1989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/15/issue/1,109
"This paper explores the general reasons for the sudden decline in the growth of world metal demand which began after 1974 and continues to impact the metal industries. For all of the eight metals studied, except aluminium, the dominant cause of this atrophy in demand is the stagnation in total world economic growth, which has caused reduced demand for all goods and services. In addition, consumer preferences have shifted away from metal-intensive goods, further reducing the need for metals. However, materials substitutions and manufacturing technologies have continued to evolve towards lower use of metal in each product at much the same rate after 1974 as before. Therefore, these aspects do not explain the sudden shortfall after 1974 except in the case of aluminium which experienced a dramatic change during the energy crisis years.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 1988,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/14/issue/4,110
"Failure of demand was a critical factor in producing low metal prices in the first part of the 1980s. However, it does not satisfactorily explain why prices went as low as they did for as long as they did. For an explanation of this we need to look to supply factors, notably to industry costs and the impact of high real interest rates on stockholding and output behaviour. These same supply factors seem also to have played a part in the eventual turnaround in prices in 1987. The paper concludes with some thoughts on the lessons the analysis might hold for the future.","Volume 14, Issue 4",December 1988,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/14/issue/4,110

"In this paper we discuss contracts used in the exploration and development of gas reserves in developing countries. Natural gas has several features that distinguish it from oil. Most importantly, gas pipelines are relatively expensive and have large economies of scale. Additionally, for most countries gas must be sold on internal markets, usually to state monopsony buyers. The foreign oil company must therefore become involved in a close and long-term relationship with the relevant state agencies. The paper discusses the nature of the bilateral relationship between oil company and state during a gas project. Long-term development contracts and the clauses that deal with this relationship are discussed. In addition contract terms to encourage exploration, including concession terms, are reviewed. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of optimal contract forms and likely requirements for future gas projects.","Volume 14, Issue 3",September 1988,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/14/issue/3,111

"Strategic materials, it is conventionally argued, should be subjected to conservation and stockpiling measures; the aim being to optimize supplies of these ‘special’ materials for essential applications. This paper contains a critique of this conventional approach to strategic materials planning and a re-evaluation of the supply vulnerability and usage criticality criteria. It is argued that a more systematic, multipronged, approach to resource contingency planning is required. Stockpiling could play a role in mitigating the effects of short-term supply shortages, but to be effective it would have to be operated in a dynamic manner. Stockpiling policy should be buttressed by, among other measures, government support for R and D programmes aimed at stimulating substitution processes and greater recycling activity. In order to achieve rational contigency planning of materials resources in Europe an appropriate administrative framework is required.

"The growth in world demand for metals has slowed considerably since 1974, but the resulting problems for producers have been compounded because this slack demand was largely unanticipated and unrecognized until the early 1980s. Capacity thus continued to expand, based on expectations of recovery to the previous high growth rates in consumption. When this recovery did not materialize, a prolonged period of low real prices, loss of profitability, and plant closures resulted. The losses due to delayed recognition and adjustment may total as much as several billion dollars. These problems point out the danger of relying on extrapolations of past time trends rather than developing a fundamental understanding of the factors which determine metal demand when planning future productive capacity.","Volume 14, Issue 2",June 1988,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/14/issue/2,112
A disaggregated study of the role of input prices in the process of material substitution should involve modelling this role on the basis of incentives given to technological developments which enable firms to substitute away from more expensive materials. An appropriate procedure for emphirical investigation should involve the collection of information and data by means of surveying and an analysis on the basis of judgemental techniques. This methodological approach is more appropriate than statistical techniques such as regression analysis and offers the potential to address questions which the more aggregated studies of commodity demand and substitution have left unanswered.,"Volume 14, Issue 2",June 1988,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/14/issue/2,112

A working definition and basic data about the adequacy of mineral resources from which advanced materials are derived is compiled. More importantly, a parallel development in the materials arena, the shift to organic mineral materials in high volume conventional applications, that tends to get lost in the excitement about advanced materials, is described. This exercise of contrasting advanced material with the organic material developments clarifies a variety of concerns raised by the development of new materials.","Volume 14, Issue 1",March 1988,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/14/issue/1,113
"The issues of minerals supply and minerals interests are examined from a corporate, rather than the conventional national, perspective. Attention is focused on the UK's overseas mining interests and on the extent to which ore processing operations in the EEC are fed from mines located overseas but carrying an EEC company interest. The analysis reveals that UK and EEC mining interests are more extensive, and more complex, than might be deduced from national data alone.","Volume 14, Issue 1",March 1988,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/14/issue/1,113

"Alaska is richly endowed with world class deposits of metals and coal besides petroleum. Development of mineral industry has been slow. Metal prices, mining costs and lack of infrastructure have been major factors inhibiting mineral development in Alaska. Interesting examples of national policy towards Arctic mineral development can be found in Canada and the USSR. Mineral industry can play an important role in diversifying the Alaskan economy and in contributing to US mineral production.","Volume 14, Issue 1",March 1988,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/14/issue/1,113
"Among the many difficulties that developing countries must face when engaging in international trade are the range of formal trade barriers which exist. These involve a wide array of controls and restrictions which range from the well known tariff, to a variety of lesser known and difficult to identify non-tariff barriers (NTBs). A commonly posed question is to what extent do these trade barriers restrict or inhibit the trade activities of the developing countries? Although this type of question has been extensively studied for agricultural and industrial products, little attention has been paid to the situation regarding forest products. This paper addresses this topic.","Volume 14, Issue 1",March 1988,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/14/issue/1,113
"New models of sustainable development stress the importance of the efficient management of resources, including labour, capital equipment and natural resources. Overuse of the resource base today will lead to shortages tomorrow; yet it can be a difficult task persuading politicians and planners in developing countries of the importance of resource management.

"The effect of resource rent taxation on mineral exploration is a controversial issue on which very little research has been carried out. Simple numerical examples are used in this paper to demonstrate that a ‘pure’ resource rent tax, or Brown Tax, can reduce the extent of exploration of a ‘promising’ deposit by a risk averse explorer, but encourage exploration of ‘unpromising’ deposits. This counter-intuitive result is explained in terms of the effect of the tax and of exploration on the costs of risk and uncertainty.","Volume 13, Issue 4",December 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/4,114
"The petroleum industry has traditionally generated substantial revenues for governments. Where governmental power is divided, as in federations like Canada and Australia, a junior level of government normally collects royalties while the senior level levies a variety of imposts (income tax, export duties, excises on production). The combination of recent sharp reductions in prices, more price volatility and an era of freer markets has subjected existing tax and royalty systems to severe strain and has shifted attention to the design of fiscal systems that are more profit- sensitive. For the royalty element, interest focuses on net value royalties (NVRs). This paper deals with the nature and problems of NVRs. It proceeds by looking first at the application of resource rent royalties in Australia. It then focuses on recent megaproject royalty arrangements in Alberta and evaluates the degree to which Alberta's current royalty system is profit- sensitive. Problems associated with NVRs are discussed in the fourth section; concluding remarks are made in the last section.","Volume 13, Issue 4",December 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/4,114
In 1983 Interior Secretary Watt changed the nature of auctions for oil and gas leases on the outer continental shelf by dramatically increasing the acreage offered for lease. The General Accounting Office (GAO) developed the first econometric estimates that this change in policy led to a seven billion nominal dollar loss in the first two years of area-wide leasing. This paper reports regression results from estimating the reduced form of the GAO specification and several alternative specifications. All the specifications indicate no significant effect of the policy change on bonus revenues.,"Volume 13, Issue 4",December 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/4,114
"In recent years, production of non-ferrous metals has been shifting toward LDCs as low dollar denominated commodity prices have made producers in the USA and other industrial countries uneconomic. Taking the case of aluminium, this study uses a worldwide cost model to estimate costs on a standardized US price and LDC price basis. It shows that on such a standardized basis, US production costs are as low or lower than costs in the LDCs, suggesting that the current competitive advantage of the LDCs is a matter of exchange rates.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/3,115

"Minerals/metals markets are characterized by lumpy investments which impart a bias towards rigidity. That rigidity increased in the 1970s owing to heightened global economic uncertainty. The unexpected slowdown in global metals demand was a fundamental cause of the heightened uncertainty, but adjustment to it was hampered by a simultaneous reduction in the homogeneity of producers. The two main causes of reduced producer homogeneity were: the emergence of unstable and sizable differences in producer competitiveness and the proliferation of producers. A reduction in minerals market rigidity requires two sets of conditions. First, restoration of greater stability in global economic growth, inflation, energy prices and exchange rates; and second, an increase in producer homogeneity through the encouragement of joint ventures. Increased producer homogeneity facilitates expansion where investment is lumpy and since this improves the efficiency of capital it may be socially justified provided it is not accompanied by excess profits.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/3,115

"This paper reviews the significance of water/soils management problems as they are perceived, identified or acted upon by a range of institutions in Australian society. Reference is made to state/Commonwealth perspectives or land degradation, the fragmented responsibility in institutional arrangements and the political aspects of current land use planning issues. There is a lack of broad consensus on environmental problems and how to solve them. Emergent issues in water planning include the increasing importance of environmental river flows, urban water demand management, and the sunderstanding of the changing mechanisms of water allocation. The importance of scientific knowledge in natural resource agency decision making is found contentious in view of the varying roles of technical experts in organizations and the base line of political expediency. Requirements of effective policy making and monitoring of implementation highlight some of the ‘intractable’ problems in water and land management.","Volume 13, Issue 3",September 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/3,115

Environmental economists often argue that the social benefits of a wilderness area can be seen as a value output; the problem is how to determine whether this value outweighs the value of developing the natural resources of the area.

"There has been strong pressure, particularly within UNCTAD, for international stabilization agreements for the major commodity markets, in order to stabilize prices and to redistribute resources towards the developing country producers. However, no empirical evidence on the feasibility or desirability of these proposals has appeared. As an illustration of the possibilities, this paper makes estimates of the stabilizing power and costs of buffer stock interventions in the world copper market. We find that price and revenue stabilization is technically possible; but that to generate income transfers to the developing countries is prohibitively expensive and creates a further problem of redistribution among developing country producers.","Volume 13, Issue 2",June 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/2,116
"Sealed bid auctions for offshore federal mineral holdings are a source of substantial litigation brought by environmental groups and the states against the US government. A basic utility maximizing model and explanations based on externalities and wealth seeking behaviour are used to predict a willingness to pay by interest groups to delay a lease on specific tracts. A method is developed that incorporates bids for delay into the auction process. Estimates of the minimum payment to delay a lease, based on data from two lease sales, are compared to the budget of selected environmental groups, states and local governments.","Volume 13, Issue 2",June 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/2,116

This approach eliminates the need for giving weights to parts of the output accruing to different sections of society. Attention is focused on the evolution of institutions that ensure that project output/input shall accrue to different social groups. For the specific project analysed, rates of return to the project authority and to society are calculated. It is found that a divergence of interests between the two may exist. This can be minimized by correct selection of design and a system of cost sharing based on people's participation.","Volume 13, Issue 2",June 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/2,116

The paper attempts to verify the claim that output in state owned copper mining industries is less sensitive to price changes than in private ones. This is done by comparing the price sensitivity of copper supply in countries with state and privately owned copper industries and by testing whether nationalization leads to changes in the supply behaviour of copper mining industries. It is found that low supply elasticities and nationalizations are both the result of a country's high dependence on copper and are not themselves causally related.,"Volume 13, Issue 1",March 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/1,117
"The world nickel market has slowly evolved from domination by the International Nickel Company (Inco) into a competitive structure. Presently, the nickel industry is characterized by product surpluses and low prices. The change in structure and the current state of the industry has resulted from the price strategy followed by the leading nickel producers, a general decline in market development expenditures, certain characteristics of developing nickel producing capacity and several unforeseen events. Examination of these factors can help in developing policy options aimed at improving the future of the industry.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/1,117
"Estimating the impact of a disruption of the supply of a critical resource to an economy involves two tasks: estimation of the distribution of the diminished supply among the direct users of the resource and estimation of the effects on the rest of the economy of the direct user's reduced production. Input-output (I-O) analysis is well suited to these tasks, particularly the second, because of the model's industrial detail and general equilibrium framework. Under the assumption of fixed coefficients, alternative variants of the I-O model are considered and a recommendation made. Further, it is suggested that the scope for varying the model's coefficients, because of the potential for input substitution, be investigated on a case by case basis.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/1,117

"Hydropower, in contrast to hydroenergy, is shown to be governed by depletion pricing: its real price is theoretically subject to a secular rise at the real social rate of discount. The alternative is to charge the equivalent constant cost for long term contracts with major consumers such as local authorities and smelters. Contract prices will therefore be above current marginal power cost in the initial phase and below it in the final phase of the contract.","Volume 13, Issue 1",March 1987,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/13/issue/1,117
"While it is now widely accepted that the harnessing of water resources can make a major contribution to economic progress in various parts of the world, there is also increasing concern about the adverse environmental effects that such development may produce. Reviewing experiences in several countries, however, it seems that it may be possible to reconcile the management of water resources and the maintenance of environmental integrity. The paper assesses the likelihood of a reconciliation taking place in the light of a number of trends in contemporary water management. While many of these trends are in the direction of harmonious development, the pace of accommodation has typically been slow and erratic. The authors offer some suggestions as to how this might be overcome through modifications in legislation, policies, procedures and administrative structures.","Volume 12, Issue 4",December 1986,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/12/issue/4,118

"The USA and Canada are each considering measures to reduce general exposure to asbestos. Product bans and workplace exposure rules may each reduce general exposure by reducing domestic asbestos demand. The effectiveness of demand-reducing measures will depend upon the elasticity of asbestos supply to the domestic market. This paper provides calculations of this elasticity for three fibre grade groupings, using a framework that recognizes international trade in asbestos and the joint product nature of most asbestos fibre production. The results suggest that reductions in North American demand result in relatively substantial changes in asbestos use but very small changes in price.","Volume 12, Issue 4",December 1986,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/12/issue/4,118
"In this paper a rate of return analysis is carried out on public forestry in Northern Ireland. Analysis is based on the results obtained in two very different locations: a 100-hectare acquisition in the western part of the province where the quality of land is generally poor and a 10-hectare plantation in the east where soil and other conditions are reasonably good. The species in question is Sitka spruce, an evergreen variety which is planted for commercial purposes throughout the UK. Rate of return figures obtained here indicate that even with narrow commercial considerations, forestry in Northern Ireland is a sound venture and should expand rapidly to moderate the timber deficiency which exists in the province as well as in the UK and the EEC.","Volume 12, Issue 4",December 1986,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/12/issue/4,118
"This paper examines recent trends in East-West trade in general. During the later 1960s and early 1970s trade between East and West grew faster than world trade. But after 1976 this growth slowed as trade between Eastern Europe and the West collapsed, although the USSR continued to trade with the West. It is shown that the second oil price rise in 1979 produced enhanced terms of trade for the USSR. The major products traded between East and West are identified and it is noted that the future direction of East-West trade will be profoundly influenced by whether or not the USSR undertakes significant economic reform.","Volume 12, Issue 3, Pages 162-288 (September 1986)",September 1986,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/12/issue/3,119

US regulations will close Douglas, but Mexican and international lending agency regulations are inadequate to affect the Mexican smelters. SO2 production and fixation in both reverberatory and flash furnaces are analysed in terms of the products (acid and gypsum), fixation costs and the problem of their profitable disposal, particularly in Mexico. Relating the costs to Mexican currency exchange rates and economic problems, smelter pollution control reduces the competitive position of Mexican copper production and affects its trade balance, leading to a Mexican reluctance to maintain the agreement.","Volume 12, Issue 2",June 1986,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/12/issue/2,120

"A new mineral policy began to emerge in the early 1980s in Canada. Both its goals and instruments are detailed and contrasted with the goals and instruments of previous mineral policies. It is suggested that the two major types of policy instruments of the 1980s are productivity management (especially R & D and innovation) and synergy management (the achievement of external economies, especially via procurement, regional and trade instruments). The mining industry's rapid adjustment to the brutal competitive realities of the 1980s in cutting costs and increasing productivity—a model of industrial restructuring—is discussed in relation to emerging trends in taxation, including the possibly fruitless search for a ‘neutral’ tax system.","Volume 12, Issue 1",March 1986,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/12/issue/1,121

In order to give several perspectives on this contribution, three simulations are performed based on three issues which are presumed to be of considerable importance to the Western Australian economy; an expansion in overseas resource demand; a general reduction in tariffs; and a federally imposed resource export tax. The results demonstrate both the importance of these issues to Western Australia and the significance of the role of the extractive industries in determining the overall results.

"The single variable techniques and variance decompositions reviewed here provide essentially descriptive information on commodity instability. The single variable measures may assist in making the distinction between ‘acceptable’ and ‘unacceptable’ variability or in characterizing some particular aspect of instability, such as the prevalence of outliers in a data series. The decompositions provide a view of the instability through the contributions of its tautological components. Insight into different facets of instability are provided by each approach; taken together, these techniques can be used to build a composite picture of the instability phenomenon. However, neither offers explanation of the casual, structural forces from which the observed instability arises.","Volume 12, Issue 1",March 1986,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/12/issue/1,121
"In 1931, Hotelling developed a rule which became a central efficiency criterion in natural resource economics. It states that in a competitive world the rate of capital gains due to resource use must equal the rate of return on any other asset. Here, the author presents a modification for easier handling of discrete time models taking capital depreciation into account.","Volume 12, Issue 1",March 1986,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/12/issue/1,121
"The author examines the reasons behind the current state of the North American metal mining industry. Taking demand-side factors first, he explains the dramatic fall in metals consumption. External shocks are seen to have affected the previously well rationalized structure of supply in the 1960s, bringing about an increase in production costs and limiting capacity for industrial rationalization. At the beginning of the 1980s, the situation is seen to have been exacerbated by a larger number of producers, more supply sources and an increase in costs. During the course of the decade, the author relates how the situation worsened due to the strength of the US dollar and high interest rates.","Volume 11, Issue 4",December 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/4,122
"The risk of financial failure among LDC mining projects, always significant, has apparently increased during recent years. This situation, which is unlikely to change in the near future, has important implications for LDC mineral policies. In particular, it can no longer be assumed that mining will generate significant government revenues, traditionally regarded as the single most important economic benefit arising from large-scale mining projects in LDCs. Many LDC governments consequently need to reassess their mineral policies and place greater stress on maximizing economic benefits which will accrue even where mines fail to generate significant profits. Two such benefits are discussed, and concrete policy measures are suggested to illustrate the initiatives available to LDCs.","Volume 11, Issue 4",December 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/4,122
"This paper describes how the Carajas iron ore project was set up in February 1985 at a time of deep recession in the iron ore and steel industries. Development of the project was met with much criticism, mainly from North American steel makers, who argued that the project would only be successful through the support of a Third World government, highly dependent on foreign exchange, without any consideration being given to its economic feasibility or to the fundamentals of the market. The authors explain why the World Bank took the step of setting up the project and how its development can be partly explained by the interests of the Japanese and European steel makers. The role of the Brazilian government is explained and the authors conclude that the relatively low rate of investment anticipated by the project will be overshadowed by the high gains in foreign exchange.","Volume 11, Issue 4",December 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/4,122

The current crisis of confidence characterized in international investment and trade in extractive resources has become detrimental to both the resource-rich developing countries and the resource-hungry industrialized countries. Japan is one nation that has developed a strategy to foster mutual trust and to restore confidence in the international extractive industries.

"The objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that cyclical metal mining activity is more stable when multi-metal products are produced. A theoretical short-run supply curve for a metal is developed showing by-product, co-product, and main product behaviour. This curve is used to illustrate co-product pricing trends that are indicative of different cyclical behaviour patterns. The non-parametrical sign test is used to test co-product price trends for the US metal mining industry. The results indicate that multi-metal production stabilizes the mining industry in the short run but not in the long run.","Volume 11, Issue 4",December 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/4,122
The intuitively appealing notion that the materials intensity of GDP declines with economic maturity has recently attracted attention: Upon closer inspection the basic concept is seen to be vaguely defined: efforts at measurement do not yield unequivocal results and the causes of change are imperfectly understood.

"The dollar-based commodity price index prepared by UNCTAD declined by 30% in the five-year period ending in January 1985. A variety of factors explains this fall. Most important among these is probably the phenomenal appreciation of the US currency. For instance, the dollar rose against the Deutschmark by 84% during that time, and UNCTAD's commodity price index shows a rise of about 30% when measured in West German money. Surely, the dollar commodity prices would have fallen far less or possibly even increased in the absence of the exchange rate shifts that were actually recorded.","Volume 11, Issue 3",September 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/3,123
"The USSR ranks as a major producer of virtually all energy and non-fuel minerals. Soviet minerals policy, a key component of national economic development, is based primarily on an unprecedented level of self-sufficiency. The author explains how recent changes in historical export-import patterns, decreasing ore grades, rising consumption, limitations imposed by the Soviet economic system, and depletion of easily accessible deposits could signify a future inability to sustain its supply independence. The apparent existence of vast, remote mineralized areas in Asia suggests self-sufficiency could remain an option available to Soviet leaders, but it would be even more expensive to maintain.","Volume 11, Issue 3",September 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/3,123
"The contents of international commodity agreements have changed from those in which open-ended intervention mechanisms regulated the market defending a normative price to those limiting intervention so as not to obscure market forces and consequently the market price. Underlying this change is the principle to which the developed countries accorded the highest priority, namely that the interests of producing and consuming countries must balance to avoid an indiscriminate transfer of resources. On the other hand, the principles which guided agreements that set a normative price were based on the grounds that the market price determined by unequal partners was unfair and that internationally agreed developmental goals implied untied and unconditional resource transfers by means of normative, higher than market, prices. These two sets of principles were incompatible. As a result negotiations were not only difficult but inconclusive. Another reason for this outcome was that the question of the cost effectiveness of market duplicating agreements based on the principle of balanced interests was unresolved. These reasons explain why commodity agreements do not figure currently in substantive discussions on North-South cooperation and why only three commodity agreements have a functional role and even of these three, one is not in force definitively.","Volume 11, Issue 3",September 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/3,123
This paper uses a model of the optimum buffer stock as a ‘filter rule’ together with a financial model that can be used to assess the efficiency of international commodity markets. The approach is simpler to apply than many other methods which have hitherto been used and yields an economy in theoretical and computational effort. The arguments are applied as a case study to the international copper market. The main conclusion is that private storage is not under-provided for and that a public buffer stock agency would be unlikely to be self-financing.,"Volume 11, Issue 3",September 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/3,123
"The business rationality of the CMEA mineral traders is bound by several characteristics of mineral production under central planning and by the mechanics of foreign trade monopoly. These characteristics include aspects such as: priority of national economic goals over trading strategies of the Foreign Trade Organisations (FTOs) in Eastern Europe; balance-of-payment problems; the organizational complexities and the weakness of the incentive mechanism, as well as the lack of an appropriate performance criterion. It is suggested that the 30 mineral trading FTOs in the CMEA tend to perform in a manner comparable to marketing departments of the Western mineral industries but are at a clear disadvantage when compared with ‘stand alone’ Western intermediaries making profits through risk taking and abhoring bureaucracy and rigidity in management.","Volume 11, Issue 3",September 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/3,123
"The paper considers the degree to which declining market power explains modifications in pricing behaviour observed since the late 1970s in the North American aluminium, copper, lead and zinc industries. More precisely, it relates those changes in pricing policies to the price elasticity of demand facing the dominant strategic group in each industry, the cost elasticity of supply and to the management's ability to coordinate or internalize conduct decisions. The results suggest that the firms in the copper and lead industries do not hold as a group any form of market power. In the case of the aluminum industry, a notable increase in the price elasticity of demand since the end of the 1970s, a sustained decrease in the concentration ratio and a rigid production process are weakening the presence of market power in that industry. The results are inconclusive in the case of the zinc industry since the determinants of market power move in opposite directions.","Volume 11, Issue 3",September 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/3,123
"Futures trading has been introduced for aluminium and oil in recent years and the range of contracts available on various minerals and oil products continues to widen. Concern has been expressed by producers of a number of minerals, including nickel and platinum, that the introduction of futures trading may introduce a speculative element to price determination that will create inappropriate or excessively volatile prices. It is the purpose of this article to analyse the role of futures trading in relation to trade in underlying commodities in general and especially for trade in minerals and oil. Evidence from oil and platinum markets, in particular, is adduced and examined in the light of earlier evidence of the influence of futures trading on underlying commodities. The contribution of futures trading is examined in detail and conclusions are reached on the significance of futures trading for minerals and oil.","Volume 11, Issue 2",June 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/2,124
Consuming nations and industry segments within them play a crucial role in the success of commodity agreements. For individual firms the desirability of the agreements is seen to depend on the form of the agency agreement and the competitive position of the firm in both the domestic and world market.

The mechanism of the agreements is analysed as well as the problems that lead to their limitation or termination.,"Volume 11, Issue 2",June 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/2,124
"The rapid exhaustion of Malaysia's commercial primaeval forest base has raised questions regarding the management and economic responses in the sector. The article assesses the institutional and management structure of Malaysian forestry which, together with the social and political barriers at work, prevent an orderly programme of harvesting and reforestation. The supply is then set out in terms of an econometric model, formulated both in static and dynamic terms to measure, among other things, the responses of output to price changes. The model, which is the first of its kind to be tested for the Malaysian forestry sector, is applied on three wood-based commodities — sawlogs, sawnwood and plywood. To learn of possible regional variations, the model is also applied to data of the country's three principal components — Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak and Sabah. The results indicate that short-run price elasticities of supply are low, and in some cases, even contrary to expectations based on economic theory. Allowing for data inconsistencies, the slow responses of output to changes in price may be attributed to the method of wood disposal, its timing as well as the social and political barriers to entry at work in the sector.","Volume 11, Issue 2",June 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/2,124

The practice of justifying such projects by upvaluing foreign exchange is considered, as is the cost of distortion. Export efficiency is introduced as the key criterion: the efficiency of some recent smelter proposals in Oceania was between 36 and 50 cents in the dollar.

"The copper industry in the USA is declining, but exploration for copper has been particularly promising in western Montana. The potential copper mine capacity of the area was estimated by using an interdisciplinary geological-economical assessment technique that categorizes deposits on the basis of development probability. Development probability is quantified and aggregated into potential new mine supply curves, which summarize resource potential of the region. The results suggest that copper resources in Montana and elsewhere are potentially large and that these resources probably will be mined at higher copper prices. This mineral assessment technique increases the usefulness of traditional methods for planners and policy makers.","Volume 11, Issue 2",June 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/2,124

However, the article concludes that we still have much to learn before making a full comparison of Soviet and US exploration.","Volume 11, Issue 2",June 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/2,124
"As uranium has practically no other industrial uses besides electricity generation, demand is determined by the requirements and stockpiling policies of electric utilities. The uranium market has experienced strong fluctuations and is currently affected by the reductions in nuclear forecasts resulting from the slowdown in electricity demand. Analysing supply/demand indicators proves, however, that in retrospect the development has been relatively smooth and it appears that oversupply is more a consequence of overly optimistic short-term expectations. In the future, especially in the long term, nuclear power policies continue to be concerned with striking a proper balance between increasing production capability and development of new reactor technologies which would be less dependent on the availability of uranium. A bounding scenario approach is applied in this article to the assessment of adequacy of supply under varying assumptions on the total installed nuclear capacity, available resource base and attainable production capability.","Volume 11, Issue 2",June 1985,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/11/issue/2,124

The increased expansion of commodity futures trading has also led to heightened regulatory concerns throughout the world. The USA has been especially aggressive in asserting jurisdiction and establishing regulatory controls over persons dealing in the US markets.

"Theoretically, a resource rent tax is neutral in that it does not influence the allocation of resources. However, the application of such fundamental principles in the tax formula of the South African gold mining industry negates the neutrality principle. A progressive element in the tax rate encourages mining of submarginal ores - leads to misallocation of resources. However, it substantially reduces the financial risks of a mining company engaged in the extraction of a commodity characterized by price volability, such as gold, and permits economies of scale in mining and encourages conservation of a non-renewable resource. As long as prices increase faster than costs, the advantages of this system probably exceed the disadvantages. The choice of the threshold rate in such a tax system is critical. If it is too high it will encourage mining of submarginal ores, and if too low it does not recognize the peculiar risks of gold mining investments.","Volume 10, Issue 4",December 1984,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/10/issue/4,126

Despite the high rate of their extraction in the past 30 years, the recorded reserves of these non-renewable materials were higher in 1981 than in 1950 and they seem to meet foreseeable demand for a long time to come, as indicated by the estimated static lifetime for each of the minerals covered. The dynamic nature of ‘reserves’ is emphasized: further exploration and scientific and technological advance will add to the present proven reserves, and at a higher price further resources will be ‘upgraded’ into commercially exploitable reserves. Apparent long-term security can be disturbed by natural disasters, political events or other factors, especially in the case of minerals whose reserves and production are highly concentrated in one country.

"Political-economic events of the 1970s brought mineral resource appraisal to the focus of national policy. Estimates of and methodologies for mineral resources appraisal were scrutinized, revealing deficiencies in method and data and fostering considerable debate about the credibility of estimates and about preferred methodology. Since credibility can be increased through the acquisition of additional geoscience information, questions regarding methodology have more than one formulation and therefore more than one correct solution, depending upon the expected value of additional information and the conditional losses of relevant policy options. When existing information is meagre and the expected value of information is high, the optimum decision may be to defer all policy options until after the acquisition and analysis of- additional information. Decision theory offers an analytical framework that is sufficiently generalized to provide answers for highly varied circumstances of geoscience and resource information and policy issues. Our ability to perform any such analysis is limited by inaccuracies in both geologists' estimates of undiscovered mineral resources, and in economists' calculations of conditional losses of policy options for each of the relevant states of mineral resources.","Volume 10, Issue 2",June 1984,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/10/issue/2,128

It appears that changes in the level of exports (and resulting government expenditures) have a number of impacts on the non-oil sector of the economy which take some time for their full effect to be felt. Government expenditures have become somewhat independent of current oil exports, so the current oil glut and falling revenues for Saudi Arabia are not likely to be translated into slower non-oil income growth.","Volume 10, Issue 2",June 1984,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/10/issue/2,128

"This article critically examines international price stabilization policy in relation to the main features of the world copper market and the structural changes that have affected the industry in the decade up to 1982. The first section summarizes the main features of the world copper market, briefly discussing the principal structural changes; the second part examines the recent pattern of investment in copper and changes in ownership of some copper producing companies resulting from the need for improved cash flows due to the adverse effects of the recession; and the third part analyses the practical and theoretical issues relating to the question of price instability. A number of formidable problems are likely to arise from such price stabilization policies and it is concluded that it is because of these difficulties that the policies have not been implemented. Consequently, international commodity agreements designed to minimize or avoid price instability have proved difficult to conclude. New questions on which consensus is likely should be examined to promote intergovernmental co-operation, and hence market stability. With that end in view, this article lists some new questions that could form the basis of an agenda for exploratory intergovernmental discussions on copper.","Volume 10, Issue 1",March 1984,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/10/issue/1,129
"In their analysis of the Saskatchewan Uranium Royalty (SUR) scheme Anderson and Barnett (1983) conclude that the scheme is effective in that, together with the other levies on the uranium industry, it succeeds in appropriating 75–80% of available economic rent under reasonable assumptions about uranium price and production costs. While collecting a substantial proportion of economic rent was a major provincial government objective in designing the tax structure, provincial tax planners may also have been concerned to ensure that marginal production decisions be affected as little as possible by the tax. Because their model of the Key Lake mine considers only the extraction plan adopted by the firm, Anderson and Barnett are unable to conclude whether a different plan would have been adopted in the absence of the tax. In other words, the nature of their model confines their investigation to the question of effectiveness, as defined above. The purpose of the present article is to examine the question of whether the SUR is likely to be neutral with respect to the extraction plan and to assess the effects of any tax-induced distortion.","Volume 10, Issue 1",March 1984,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/10/issue/1,129
"Regions under stress from rapid development require comprehensive planning and management tools, capable of identifying the pace, location and magnitude of growth and assessing social, economic and environmental impacts. Northwest Colorado, endowed with massive rich deposits of oil shale, went through a boom-bust cycle of growth during the early 1980s as US interest in synthetic fuels peaked and then rapidly declined. An innovative resource information system has been developed which has assisted the region in anticipating growth and modifying its consequences. This article reviews the organization and development of the Colorado Resource Information System (CRIS) and evaluates its role and impact in the decisionmaking process. Experience shows that regions which develop and maintain planning and information tools can have significant influence on economic development.","Volume 10, Issue 1",March 1984,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/10/issue/1,129
"Most of the two billion tonnes of limestone consumed annually is used either as the basic raw material in the manufacture of cement or as flux input in the metallurgical industries. Of the total flux, 90% is used by the steel industry. The cement industry needs limestone in a finely pulverized form, whereas the steel industry uses it in lump form, with the lumps not less than 12 mm in size. The exploitation of limestone as flux for the steel industry must be scientifically planned. This article covers the methodology of planning, incorporating the study of the detailed status of the resource inventory, demand for limestone, exploration of new deposits, and calculating and manipulating the costs of production, transport and development of each project to match the demand pattern of steel plants. A computer was used for the optimization of supplies and their selection on planning horizons.","Volume 10, Issue 1",March 1984,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/10/issue/1,129
"This article reviews the available information on the uranium industry and the beginning of nuclear power in China. Few details of China's uranium industry have hitherto been published in the West. The broad conclusions reached are that China is faced with severe energy shortages for the foreseeable future; nuclear power will help to solve this problem but the timing and extent of its contribution are uncertain. The central question of civil nuclear policy is whether or not to use imported technology, although satisfactory development of the uranium industry probably will require foreign assistance. The principle conestraint in this regard is foreign exchange. To help overcome this problem the Chinese are now, for the first time, offering uranium on the international market.","Volume 9, Issue 4",December 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/4,130
"The objective of this paper is to compare the nature of the taxation schemes facing uranium mine operators in Australia's Northern Territory and in Canada's Province of Saskatchewan. The findings demonstrate that, although the Canadian system appropriates up to 85% of incremental sales revenue, it is extremely sensitive to industry profitability. Its Australian counterpart is, in contrast, a regressive scheme which, at the current selling price of yellowcake, captures a significantly larger proportion of available economic rent.","Volume 9, Issue 4",December 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/4,130
"This article analyses the world demand for cobalt. It estimates short- and long-run elasticities with respect to price, activity and in some cases with respect to substitute-complement variables. For the USA these estimates have been obtained for all the important end-use categories. Aggregate elasticities are estimated for Japan, West Germany, France and for the non-communist world (excluding the USA). The appendix to the paper models price setting in the cobalt market and presents two simple simulations conducted on the world cobalt market.","Volume 9, Issue 4",December 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/4,130
"The potential impact of short-run disruptions in the minerals market on Israel's small, developed open economy is examined, showing that Israel is potentially capable of a smoother adjustment to external market disturbances. First, the analysis evaluates critical situations within the framework of a normative ‘general equilibrium model’, tracing the impacts of short-run developments in the resources market, and, second, it focuses on specific minerals within a partial equilibrium framework, using economic supply - demand relationships to assess economic damages. The potential damage estimates indicate that significant research and development outlays in the areas of material and process substitution and the capability for a quick build-up of contingent inventories would be justified to prevent the damages which supply disruption might inflict on the economy.","Volume 9, Issue 4",December 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/4,130
"This paper critically examines pricing policy options for water resources and attempts to derive an operationally feasible and socially desirable pricing structure for this important resource. Marginal cost pricing options are studied under different economic and resource conditions, such as inflation, constrained water resources and price distortions in an economy. Options such as pricing of water at its ‘real’ resource value, ‘social’ pricing, and pricing to reflect intangible benefits are also examined.","Volume 9, Issue 4",December 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/4,130
"The capital allowance structure for mining projects in developing countries affects the supply price of investment by determining the payback period, reinvestment and the timing of government receipts. Using the capital allowance structures of Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Zambia, Botswana, Papua New Guinea and Malaysia, the article develops a financial model and examines the effect of capital allowances on foreign investor and host government cash flows under various cost-price conditions. The study stresses the importance to governments of making accelerated depreciation a flexible tool to trade off against other elements in the fiscal package. From the government viewpoint, faster write-offs of capital are preferable to a tax holiday. The article places particular emphasis on evaluating the relationship between capital allowances, income tax and a rent resource tax.","Volume 9, Issue 3",September 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/3,131
"The concept of value is central to mineral economics as it is all branches of economics. In the minerals sphere particular problems are posed for a theory of value by, firstly, the non- renewability of mineral resources, secondly the substantial effort that must be made to convert a mineral into a useful product, and finally the perception of minerals, both economically and symbolically, as peculiarly national forms of wealth. Some thoughts are offered on different approaches to mineral resource valuation and on the frequently conflicting principles of exploitation to which these various approaches give rise.","Volume 9, Issue 3",September 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/3,131
"This article attempts to evaluate whether an appropriate consumption-based tax is likely to be successful in reducing demand for certain exhaustible resources, thereby curtailing their rate of depletion and increasing the demand for, and utilization of, secondary materials. The nature of such a tax and anticipated effects (including environmental impact) of its imposition on certain primary materials are considered, concentrating here on one metal, aluminium. The study concludes that a tax based on the exhaustible resources and energy used in the production of a good is likely to create more savings for fossil fuels than for other exhaustible resources.","Volume 9, Issue 3",September 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/3,131
"The basic objective of this paper is to present a policy assessment of the Saskatchewan Uranium Royalty (SUR). This scheme, as enacted on 1 August 1976, was designed to be an integral part of the province's rent appropriation and economic development strategy. Before the tax regime is addressed directly an overview is given of the resource policy environment within which the impost was developed.","Volume 9, Issue 3",September 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/3,131
"The problem of forest depletion needs to be given serious consideration in developing countries due to the preponderance of exploitative factors over regenerative factors. In most of the developing countries there is over-exploitation of forest resources and, unless an integrated forest resource policy is formulated and implemented, forest resources of the Third World will become the greatest ‘tragedy of the commons’.","Volume 9, Issue 3",September 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/3,131
"The resources of the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction were declared the ‘common heritage of mankind’ by the United Nations General Assembly. This article discusses the mineral resources located in this area and how the commercial availability of such resources was perceived to affect national interests. Although the exploitation of these resources would have benefited all states, some more than others, such exploitation was seen to have conflicting consequences on national interests in the light of the North-South dialogue in which trade and access to raw materials played a central role. The factual basis for these different national interests is examined by a discussion of the possible impact of mineral production from the deep-seabed on world markets and the policies implemented in the Convention on the Law of the Sea to ensure these interests are evaluated.","Volume 9, Issue 2",June 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/2,132
"This article examines the economic implications of mining or of not mining manganese nodules and summarizes potential ecological consequences. Apart from possible net economic benefits to certain countries, mining the nodules is not regarded as an economic or strategic necessity. It is concluded that expansion of basic research on oceanfloor ecosystems must be granted high priority. It is in the best interest of developed countries to become signatories of the LOS Convention in order to participate in the development of the regulatory framework and to avoid the antagonism of the international community.","Volume 9, Issue 2",June 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/2,132
"The major characteristics of the demand for uranium are identified, and a number of factors which determine the actual level of uranium requirements of the nuclear power industry are discussed. Since the role of inventories is central to the process of short-term price formation, by comparing projections of uranium production and apparent consumption, the relative level of total inventories is calculated and an assessment is made of its likely impact on the uranium market during the 1980s.","Volume 9, Issue 2",June 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/2,132
"This paper presents a model that analyses the interrelationships between markets of light non-flat steel products (such as concrete reinforcing bars) and iron and steel scrap, both of which are characterized by wide price fluctuations. The model, which was developed as a linear complementarity programming problem, seems to be robust in analysing unstable and simulataneous price movements of those markets. The model may be applied to other metal and scrap markets without substantial changes.","Volume 9, Issue 2",June 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/2,132
"The world nickel industry has been in an almost continuous state of recession since 1975. Major Canadian nickel producers have reported losses in recent years, although these have largely been due to losses from lateritic operations and other ventures, and detrimental pricing policies that have been adopted in recent years. Despite this slump, however, Canada's rich sources of nickel put the country in a good position to profit from an upturn in the nickel industry. With certain safeguards a nickel study group is seen as a useful approach to the difficult situation faced by policymakers.","Volume 9, Issue 2",June 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/2,132
This note provides a simple statement about the pricing of primary commodities — and in particular oil and non-fuel minerals.

"Trends in the UK consumption of 12 metallic and 19 non-metallic minerals are examined for the period 1945–1980. Comparisons are drawn between these trends and developments in per capita GDP, total world consumption and UK mineral processing capacity. Although the consumption of most minerals has shown a tendency to stagnate or decline in recent years, taking the post-war period as a whole the consumption of non-metallics has displayed a faster and more sustained growth than that of metallics; thus their share of the total value of minerals consumed in the UK has increased significantly.","Volume 9, Issue 1",March 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/1,133
"The degree of security of investment afforded by the applicable legal regime is one of the most important factors affecting minerals projects. This article outlines the deep-sea mining regime contained in the recently adopted Law of the Sea Convention. A history of subsea mining, including petroleum mining, is presented and the events leading to adoption of the Convention are described. Those parts of the Convention relating to deep-sea mining are analysed, and the International Sea-Bed Authority is examined. It is concluded that deep-sea mining on a commercial scale is unlikely before the end of the decade.","Volume 9, Issue 1",March 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/1,133
"This article looks at some of the barriers that have distorted the global flow of capital in the mining industry. The perceived threat of nationalization is discussed and Chile's expropriation of US copper mining companies in 1971 is examined. Political instability, leading not only expropriation but to loss of title, altered tax laws, and voided contracts, is also cited as a factor affecting investor confidence. Finally, inadequate infrastructure is regarded as a further barrier to development of Third World mineral industries.","Volume 9, Issue 1",March 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/1,133
"Available estimates of potentially recoverable world mineral and fuel resources are examined with a view to determining whether everyone likely to be living on earth next century could be raised to the material living standards people in developed countries now have. It is concluded that this goal is impossible. A number of fundamentally important implications follow, especially regarding the inappropriateness of growth strategies in general, goals for Third World development, and the need for ‘de-development’ of developed countries to much more frugal, self-sufficient and cooperative social systems.","Volume 9, Issue 1",March 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/1,133
"If futures prices ‘fully reflect’ all available information, then these prices may be interpreted as market anticipations of spot (cash) prices at the delivery date of the futures contract. This hypothesis, which has tended to find most support among established markets for storable commodities, is investigated for the Chicago silver futures market. Using instrumental variable estimation and a joint (χ2) test, the unbiased prediction hypothesis is rejected, and a tentative explanation is offered for this outcome. This result, however, does not necessarily imply that the market is inefficient, and two tests of the weak form efficient markets hypothesis suggest that, while there is some slight dependence in past prices, this is only marginally more than would be expected from normal sampling variation.","Volume 9, Issue 1",March 1983,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/9/issue/1,133
"This paper analyses the extent to which the new Reagan mineral policy will encourage increased US production, substitution, recycling and conservation, domestic stock-piling and diversification of foreign supplies. Major inadequacies of the mineral policy are the transfer of responsibility for research and development from the government to the unprepared private sector, the lack of emphasis on short-term research and development in mineral processing technology, and the lack of coordination between minerals policy and national security and foreign policy. However, overall the policy is a positive step towards reducing the current US minerals supply vulnerability.","Volume 8, Issue 4",December 1982,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/8/issue/4,134
"The international minerals industry continues to have a substantial investment shortfall. The widening exploration and mineral development gaps, not only in the lesser developed countries but also in the developed nations, are sowing the seeds for future mineral supply disruptions and conflicts. Mutuality of interests demands concerted initiatives, individual as well as collective, to reverse the investment trends established by international mineral finance and the multinational corporations in order to pave the way for secure mineral supplies in the future at acceptable prices.","Volume 8, Issue 4",December 1982,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/8/issue/4,134
"This article examines develop-for-import projects financed by development loans and mixed credits supplied by export-import banks and other financial institutions of the central governments of France, Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany. The projects discussed are those producing bauxite, alumina, aluminium, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel and tungsten, in developing market economies, Australia and Canada. The article estimates the volume of these metals committed to France, Japan and FRG to pay for loans and credits, examines the types of financial arrangement involved in develop-for-import projects, and considers the compatibility of these arrangements with the multilateral liberalized world trading system developed by the General Ageement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) over the past 40 years. To the extent that these arrangements do not fully reflect changes in international market forces, world trade in metals will tend to be distorted and discriminatory.","Volume 8, Issue 4",December 1982,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/8/issue/4,134
"Although copper is exported mainly in the form of semi-refined or refined copper, exports of copper in the form of ores and concentrates increased their share of world copper exports in the 1970s. These exports mainly originate from copper-mining areas with limited access to the inputs required for stages subsequent to mining. This article surveys the options open to copper-producing countries to increase their revenue from copper, and concludes that changes in the composition of exports to favour the export of more processed forms of copper would require substantial changes in the economic structure of a country. Trade barriers are not felt to constitute a substantial obstacle to world trade in refined or semi-fabricated copper.","Volume 8, Issue 4",December 1982,https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/resources-policy/vol/8/issue/4,134
